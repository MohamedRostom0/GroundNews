Elon Musk\u2019s foray into politics is going global. The billionaire has announced that he\u2019ll be hosting a live conversation on his social media platform X with Alice Weidel, co-chair of the far-right, anti-immigrant Alternative for Germany (AfD) Party. While the discussion has no official date yet, an AfD spokesperson stated that it would \u201cdefinitely\u201d be before the country\u2019s election on February 23. This event will likely be very similar to the sit-down that Musk had with Donald Trump on the app in August, an affair that was riddled with technical difficulties. This announcement comes as Musk was accused of election interference on Monday by the German government after writing a pro-AfD opinion column for a German newspaper, in which he stated, \u201cPortraying the AfD as far-right is clearly false, considering that Alice Weidel, the party\u2019s leader, has a same-sex partner from Sri Lanka! Does that sound like Hitler to you? Come on!\u201d He also proclaimed, \u201cOnly the AfD can save Germany\u201d on X in December. Musk has also been commenting on U.K. politics, posting \u201cFree Tommy Robinson!\u201d on X on New Year\u2019s Day. Robinson is a popular far-right, Islamaphobic activist and founding member of the British National Party. He was imprisoned for breaching an injunction regarding his repeated racially charged libel of a 15-year old Syrian boy via social media posts. Musk has had his eye on the U.K. for about a year now, calling it a state where \u201ccivil war is inevitable.\u201d The world\u2019s richest man seems to have his sights set on becoming its most powerful unelected official too.Share This StoryMore on Musk's Plans for World DominationElon Musk Defends His Petty Revenge on MAGA CriticsMost Recent PostEdith Olmsted/January 2, 2025/3:43 p.m. ETShare This StoryElon Musk Defends His Petty Revenge on MAGA CriticsElon Musk is under fire for supporting H-1B visas.Tom Williams/CQ-Roll Call, Inc/Getty ImagesTechnocrat billionaire Elon Musk finally owned up Wednesday to restricting his critics\u2019 X accounts. But the self-described \u201cfree speech absolutist\u201d doesn\u2019t see anything wrong with it.Last week, Musk began stripping the verifications from far-right accounts run by people who challenged his support for H-1B visas, after he and his co\u2013DOGE czar Vivek Ramaswamy went to war arguing that Asian workers were far better than American ones. Obviously, the pro-white American far right didn\u2019t take too kindly to that messaging. Among those who received disciplinary actions were Laura Loomer, the far-right activist and self-described \u201cproud Islamophobe\u201d whom Donald Trump ferried around during his presidential campaign, and neo-Nazi Nick Fuentes, whom Musk had invited back onto the platform just over six months ago.By taking away their verifications and knocking them out of X Pro, it seems that Musk has rendered several large accounts unable to receive ad revenue from X. Verification makes an account more visible too, so he has curbed their potential audiences. Musk also suspended some smaller accounts, according to Mediaite. He defended his decision Wednesday via his favorite medium: replies on X. \u201cPeople getting demonetized for their inexcusable behavior then complaining about free speech is hilarious to me,\u201d wrote Nicole Behnam, a journalist. \u201cYou can say whatever you want. You just can\u2019t get paid for it. Hope this helps.\u201d\u201cExactly,\u201d replied Musk. \u201cThe first amendment is protection for \u2018free speech\u2019, not \u2018paid speech\u2019 ffs.\u201dIn response to a post from Fuentes claiming, \u201cTwitter censorship is back,\u201d Musk replied, \u201cClaiming censorship while simultaneously getting millions of views is the clearest possible evidence that Fuentes has \ud83d\udca9 for brains.\u201dThis kind of logic must be new to Musk, who, if memory serves, spent several months last year fundraising and pamphleteering on behalf of Trump and JD Vance\u2014both of whom ceaselessly whine about censorship while also having the biggest platforms in the country. Of course, it\u2019s not the users\u2019 racism or hate speech that Musk is opposing\u2014the technocrat billionaire recently backed Germany\u2019s ethnonationalist party and has been known to elevate hate speech at the cost of shareholder value\u2014but, rather, it\u2019s punishing dissent within the party he intends to take over.Share This StoryRead about the fight:Elon Musk\u2019s Newest Critics on X Just Paid the PriceMost Recent PostEllie Quinlan Houghtaling/January 2, 2025/2:35 p.m. ETShare This StoryTrump Pushes Bonkers and Dangerous Conspiracy About New Year\u2019s AttacksIt\u2019s only January 2, and Donald Trump has already found a way to blame his favorite scapegoat.Eva Marie Uzcategui/Getty ImagesAn Islamic State\u2013inspired U.S. Army veteran killed 15 people when he drove a pickup through New Orleans\u2019s crowded Bourbon Street on New Year\u2019s Eve\u2014and President-elect Donald Trump has decided that immigrants should shoulder the blame for the horrifying attack.In a lengthy Truth Social post early Thursday, Trump claimed that the domestic terrorism incident was the result of open borders, distracted authorities, and the Democratic establishment.\u201cOur Country is a disaster, a laughing stock all over the World! This is what happens when you have OPEN BORDERS, with weak, ineffective, and virtually nonexistent leadership,\u201d Trump wrote. \u201cThe DOJ, FBI, and Democrat state and local prosecutors have not done their job. They are incompetent and corrupt, having spent all of their waking hours unlawfully attacking their political opponent, ME, rather than focusing on protecting Americans from the outside and inside violent SCUM that has infiltrated all aspects of our government, and our Nation itself.\u201d Fact check: The FBI\u2019s suspect for the attack, 42-year-old Shamsud-Din Jabbar, is a U.S. citizen born in Texas. And choosing to undermine the reputation of investigative agencies looking into the attack is a hair-raising choice for the man about to retake the White House in 18 days.\u201cDemocrats should be ashamed of themselves for allowing this to happen to our Country,\u201d Trump continued. \u201cThe CIA must get involved, NOW, before it is too late. The USA is breaking down\u2014A violent erosion of Safety, National Security, and Democracy is taking place all across our Nation. Only strength and powerful leadership will stop it. See you on January 20th. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!\u201dEven Fox News issued an on-air correction for Trump\u2019s incendiary statement, reminding viewers that Jabbar served in the Army and was not an immigrant. But Trump has since doubled down on his perspective, insisting that \u201cTRUMP WAS RIGHT ABOUT EVERYTHING!\u201dThe post echoed some of Trump\u2019s more violent comments on immigration. In 2023, the MAGA leader leaned on appalling language that recalled Adolf Hitler\u2019s fascistic rhetoric designed to dehumanize his enemies. Trump referred to his political rivals\u2014the GOP-anointed \u201cCommunists, Marxists, Fascists, and Radical Left Thugs\u201d\u2014as \u201cvermin,\u201d and claimed that immigrants are \u201cdestroying the blood of our country.\u201dShare This StoryRead more about Trump\u2019s immigration stance:How to Survive Trump\u2019s Mass Deportation PlansMost Recent PostEdith Olmsted/January 2, 2025/2:18 p.m. ETShare This StoryScrambling Mike Johnson Has a New Ploy to Stay in PowerMike Johnson really wants to keep his job as speaker of the House.Tom Williams/CQ-Roll Call, Inc/Getty ImagesEmbattled House Speaker Mike Johnson is trying to make it a lot harder for his colleagues to get rid of him. House Republicans unveiled a new set of rules Wednesday that will govern the incoming 119th Congress, including a rule that would make it more difficult to oust whoever is in charge. The key change would raise the threshold for a motion to vacate, by which any lawmaker can force a vote on ousting the speaker. Currently, only one person needs to file a motion to vacate. But under the new rule, a lawmaker from the majority party must be joined by eight other co-signers from that party.So if the rule passes, Johnson can only be ousted by nine Republicans.This is a significant change in proceedings, as historically motions to vacate can come from any individual lawmaker from any party. \u201cTheir proposed changes would, for the first time in American history, shield the speaker from accountability to the entire chamber,\u201d Democratic Representative Jim McGovern, the ranking member on the House Rules Committee, told Axios. \u201cThe American people did not vote for whatever the hell this is\u2014and you better believe that Democrats will not let Republicans turn the House of Representatives into a rubber stamp for their extremist policies,\u201d McGovern added.This change comes as the result of a deal struck in November, but takes on a new, bitter flavor, as Johnson has come under fire from members of his own party. It seems that Johnson could be in major trouble Friday, when he is set to be reelected or ousted from his position. It might only take two GOP defections to sink his bid, according to The Hill. Congress will also vote on its new rules package Friday, which would also dissolve the Diversity and Inclusion Office and change the name of the House Oversight Committee, among other shallow Republican priorities. If Johnson is reelected and the new rules approved, then he may have found a way to keep his gavel indefinitely.

Liman said on Monday that the court had \u201cneither directed nor permitted\u201d Giuliani\u2019s December 23 witness list \u201cto be filed under seal,\u201d ordering the list to be unsealed for the public docket. The filing includes a retired priest who played a critical role in the Catholic Church sex abuse scandal in New York. It also named Monsignor Alan Placa, Ryan Medrano, Michael Ragusa, and Giuliani\u2019s rumored girlfriend Maria Ryan, according to Law & Crime.Giuliani is headed to trial next month to determine whether he must hand over his multimillion-dollar Florida condominium to a pair of 2020 Georgia election workers he repeatedly defamed while pushing Donald Trump\u2019s lie about a stolen election. Giuliani owes the mother-daughter duo, Ruby Freeman and Shaye Moss, some $150 million in damages, but he\u2019s still working to worm his way out of the payments. Earlier this year, Giuliani claimed that the condo was his permanent residence, granting it homestead protection from debt collection proceedings under state law. But his legal opposition has argued that Giuliani was less than forthcoming during the discovery process, suggesting that the disgraced politico wasn\u2019t being honest about how he utilizes the property.In November, the former gang-busting federal prosecutor tried on a new legal defense to keep his stuff, arguing in a Manhattan courthouse that he couldn\u2019t possibly hand over his assets to Freeman and Moss because he simply didn\u2019t know where they were. Some of those assets include his Manhattan penthouse, a famously immovable object, as well as his Mercedes convertible, which he was seen driving in Florida on Election Day. In response, Judge Liman said that the idea that neither Giuliani nor anyone else in the world has knowledge about the location of his assets was \u201cfarcical.\u201dThe ex\u2013New York mayor has been besieged with legal woes since he opted to join the MAGA movement.Over the past couple of years, the former Trump attorney unsuccessfully filed for bankruptcy, lost his accountant over his insurmountable debts, begged Trump for help settling his seven-figure legal fees (he refused), had his WABC radio show canceled for spewing 2020 election lies, and miserably started his own coffee brand, \u201cRudy Coffee,\u201d in an effort to funnel in some extra cash. He ultimately lost his bankruptcy case due to his outlandish spending habits, with the presiding New York judge branding the former city mayor a \u201crecalcitrant debtor.\u201dGiuliani is also under the gun for a lawsuit from his former legal representation, who accused him of failing to pay his bill and allegedly only dishing out $214,000 of nearly $1.6 million in legal expenses. Giuliani, meanwhile, claimed he was stiffed by his favorite client, Trump, to the tune of millions of dollars. But wait, there\u2019s more: The MAGA henchman is also one of 19 co-defendants in the Georgia election interference case (in limbo but not yet dead) and was named in April in an Arizona indictment charging another slew of Republican officials and Trump allies for their alleged involvement in a scheme to overturn the state\u2019s 2020 presidential election results. In October, an Arizona judge torched a legal filing Giuliani made in the case, ruling that the ex\u2013Trump aide had \u201cnot one scintilla\u201d of evidence to question the legitimacy of a grand jury assigned to his lawsuit. And Giuliani\u2019s own legal representation in the Freeman and Moss case ditched him in November, declaring in a motion in federal court that they had reached a \u201cfundamental disagreement\u201d with Giuliani.Share This StoryMost Recent PostEllie Quinlan Houghtaling/December 31, 2024/5:14 p.m. ETShare This Story74-Year-Old Democrat Who Ran Against AOC Offers Infuriating DefenseRepresentative Gerry Connolly beat Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez in a race for a top leadership spot in the party\u2014and then defended the move in the most outrageous way possible.Kevin Dietsch/Getty ImagesDemocrats lost the White House, the House, and the Senate\u2014but that\u2019s apparently not enough cause for them to rejigger their playbook.Earlier this month, Representative Gerry Connolly bested New York Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez to become the ranking member on the House Oversight Committee. It was a battle of establishment Democratic politics versus new wave progressivism, and the Democratic caucus opted to vote against the future of the party by a margin of 47 votes.But when pressed on why a 74-year-old with a recent esophagus cancer diagnosis deserved a shot at arguably one of the most influential positions in the House, Connolly couldn\u2019t muster up a response deeper than having paid his dues. Speaking with CNN on Monday, Connolly\u2019s rationale boiled down to simple entitlement.\u201cThe decision about leadership ought to always be based on a proven record, skill set, competence, capability, and your plan for moving forward,\u201d Connolly told the network. \u201cI\u2019ve never had my chance to be a ranking member or a chairman of a full committee. This is it.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ve got the bona fides and the credentials over 16 years that my colleagues looked at, examined, validated, and decided that\u2019s what we need,\u201d he continued. \u201cAnd that\u2019s what the Democratic caucus overwhelmingly decided to do.\u201dFormer House Speaker Nancy Pelosi was reportedly entrenched in the process of getting Connolly to lead the key investigative body for the purpose of keeping Ocasio-Cortez away from the fulcrum of power.

When asked whether he planned to support the embattled speaker, he replied, \u201cMost likely.\u201d \u201cWe have decisions to be making, and we have to discuss with each other\u2014about 10 people who are leaning,\u201d McCormick said. \u201cAnd what that means is we want reassurances.

In 2015, Pepe was co-opted by the far right, and recent usage of the image in the U.S. has become synonymous with antisemites and white nationalists and harkens back to its presence at the forefront of violent movements like the Charlottesville riot and the January 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol.Under his new guise, Musk decided to attack Wikipedia, resharing a three-year-old clip of the digital encyclopedia\u2019s co-founder Larry Sanger torching his creation for going \u201cwoke.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t take it from me (I\u2019m just a frog after all), take it from the co-founder of Wikipedia,\u201d Musk wrote under his new pseudonym.(Sanger wasn\u2019t amused by the dredged-up interview.

O\u2019Leary, a Canadian businessman known for Shark Tank, praised the idea of making Canada the fifty-first state during an appearance on Fox News last Friday.\u201cI think this is a great idea, and I think the potential is massive, and the opportunity is huge,\u201d O\u2019Leary said. \u201cI think at the end of the day, Canadians and Americans, their DNA is the same in terms of what they believe in \u2026 freedom.\u201dTrump\u2019s ravings about Canada began as a joke in response to Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau\u2019s warning that Trump\u2019s plan to enforce steep tariffs would cripple both their economies. Rather than actually engage with the issue, Trump joked that Canada should just become the fifty-first state. Now he\u2019s taking that joke too far, and likely putting some money in Mr. Wonderful\u2019s pocket. \u201cThank you, MAGA, for turning the US into the laughingstock of the world,\u201d wrote the X account Republicans Against Trump in response to Trump\u2019s post.

But one Trump transition source told the Post it wasn\u2019t related to the heated debate between the \u201ctech-right\u201d and far-right factions of Trump\u2019s base over H-1B visas.Incoming Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, co-chairs Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy have found themselves at the epicenter of a digital brawl over their ardent defense of the work visa program.

In 2023, it was estimated that there were more than 700,000 H-1B visa holders in the U.S., according to data from the American Immigration Council.Republicans are in a tight position to push Trump\u2019s controversial picks through the Senate process. Assuming that all Democrats will vote against Trump\u2019s nominees, the president-elect can only afford to lose three Republican votes to squeeze his candidates into the executive branch.Some of Trump\u2019s more contentious Cabinet picks\u2014such as Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and Tulsi Gabbard\u2014have noticeably quieted their social media presence since Christmas.Share This StoryView More PostsRead More: Politics, Law, Supreme Court, Constitution, Foreign Policy, Health Care, Economic Inequality, Taxes, WashingtonBREAKING NEWS POLITICS CLIMATE CULTURE MAGAZINE PODCASTS GAMESEventsTravelBookstoreDonateAdvertiseFAQPressJobsSubmissionsSubscribe to The New RepublicSign Up for Our Newsletters Terms and ConditionsPrivacy PolicyCookie SettingsCopyright 2025 \u00a9 The New Republic.

Weidel managed to interject with a \u201cyeah\u201d every once in a while.\n\u201cI think that there\u2019s a good chance that Mars helps to save Earth at some point in the future,\u201d Musk opined. \u201cAnd once we have a civilization on Mars, we can expand to the rest of the solar system.\u201d\n\u201cThis is the most amateurish preparation for such a conversation that there has ever been,\u201d a University of Cologne politics professor wrote on X in German. \u201cWeidel is wasting the great opportunity that Musk has offered her and my impression is that he knows it.\u201d\nIn the most surreal moment of the livestream, Weidel asked Musk if he believed in God. He used the yes-or-no question to pontificate about his \u201cphilosophy of curiosity,\u201d which he ascribed to Douglas Adams\u2019 \u201cThe Hitchhiker\u2019s Guide to the Galaxy\u201d series.\n\u201cActually these are perfect last words, to be honest,\u201d Weidel responded, effectively ending the talk. \u201cIt was wonderful talking to you and listening to your views of mankind.\u201d\nInternet culture is chaotic\u2014but we\u2019ll break it down for you in one daily email.

While the AfD is polling in second place, no other political party is willing to govern in coalition with it.\nMusk had only words of praise for the politician.\n\"I think Alice Weidel is a very reasonable person,\" he said. \"Nothing outrageous is being proposed, just common sense.\"\nHe then issued a warning to the German electorate: \"People really need to get behind the AfD. Otherwise, things are going to get very much worse in Germany.\"\nGermany's domestic intelligence agency has put the AfD \u2014 a party known for hardline stances against immigration and Islam \u2014 under surveillance for suspected right-wing extremism, which the party denies. Figures in the party have been accused of using Nazi slogans in speeches and downplaying the Holocaust.\nBut Weidel surprised X-watchers when she declared that Adolf Hitler had in fact been a \"communist,\" despite being a Nazi dictator who sent communists to concentration camps and invaded the Soviet Union.\n\"He wasn't a conservative,\" she said. \"He wasn't a libertarian. He was this communist, socialist guy.\"\nWeidel thanked Musk for giving her a platform, saying, \"Elon, it's a completely new situation for me that I can just have a normal conversation and I'm not interrupted or negatively framed.\"\nIn a discussion that was at times stilted and peppered with giggling, they touched upon a wide range of topics, from immigration policy and nuclear power to alien lifeforms.\nBerlin's political center has been aghast since Musk threw his weight behind the AfD. Outgoing Chancellor Olaf Scholz told one interviewer, \"Do not feed the troll!\"\nBut last month, the conservative newspaper Welt am Sonntag published an op-ed by Musk urging Germans to vote for the AfD. The paper's opinion editor resigned in protest.\nCampaign strategist Johannes Hillje says the legacy media platform lends the party more credibility than X can among Germany's libertarian voters.\n\"This demographic sees Elon Musk as a successful entrepreneur and they don't mind his radical political views,\" Hillje argues.\nBut many do mind, including the Green party's chancellor candidate Robert Habeck, who is on the cover of the latest edition of German weekly Der Spiegel, warning Musk to keep his hands off German democracy.\nMusk retorted on X: \"Habeck is a traitor to the German people.\"\nA photo illustration of a German flag displayed on a laptop screen and Elon Musk's account on X displayed on a phone screen.\n                \n                    \n                    Jakub Porzycki/NurPhoto via Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption\nHabeck also posted his pushback on Musk's social media platform.\n\"With his billions upon billions of dollars and unbridled media power, Elon Musk's support for the AfD is not some ignorant whim,\" Habeck said in a video message. \"He's emboldening those who want to weaken Europe and its rule of law, the very regulations that limit unchecked power.\"\nEuropean Commission officials monitored Musk's talk with Weidel, checking for what the European Union's Digital Services Act classifies as hate speech or deliberate manipulation of civic discourse and electoral procedure. The commission has been investigating the platform formerly called Twitter since 2023 for violations of the 27-country bloc's digital laws.\nMusk has called himself a free speech absolutist and says he has legitimate interests in European politics, Reuters reported. He also has a Tesla factory outside Berlin.\nCampaign strategist Hillje says Musk is the AfD's most valuable campaigner \u2014 at least for now.\nAfter backing British populist leader Nigel Farage, the tech billionaire declared last week that Farage \"doesn't have what it takes\" to lead the Reform U.K. party.\nHillje says a Musk endorsement is not necessarily a safe bet: \"As an unpredictable flip-flopping guy, Musk can easily become a risk for the AfD.\"\nSponsor Message\nBecome an NPR sponsor",

Others have attended neo-Nazi events, including two leaders who appeared at a gathering of neo-Nazis in Switzerland just last month.\nMusk has downplayed the party\u2019s extremist views, claiming in his op-ed that a singular instance of one of the party\u2019s leaders being in a same-sex relationship negated its other actions \u2014 a dubious suggestion, given that AfD is also opposed to marriage equality in Germany.\nPolling indicates that AfD is not currently winning the race in Germany, but is gaining popularity \u2014 and other parties may consider forming a coalition with the far right one in order to create a government.\nLawmakers, including current Chancellor Olaf Scholz, are encouraging voters to thwart Musk\u2019s endorsements and to vote for their own interests.\n\u201cWhere Germany goes from here will be decided by you \u2014 the citizens. It will not be decided by the owners of social media channels,\u201d Scholz said in a New Year\u2019s message, a not-so-subtle jab at Musk.\nScholz added that \u201cit won\u2019t be the person who yells loudest who will decide where Germany goes from here,\u201d but instead, it will \u201cbe up to the vast majority of reasonable and decent people.\u201d\nAs Donald Trump is inaugurated a second time, independent media organizations are faced with urgent mandates: Tell the truth more loudly than ever before.

The discussion included inaccuracies, such as Musk's claim that Weidel was the most popular candidate, and various topics like energy policy and immigration. Pundits criticized Weidel's performance and communication style, suggesting she missed an opportunity to enhance her profile. While the conversation reached a live audience of 200,000, it may have primarily served to introduce Weidel to a U.S. right-wing audience rather than appeal to German voters.",

The meandering conversation may not have helped Alice Weidel as much as she hoped, say pundits.\nPerhaps unsurprisingly, the conversation between Elon Musk and Alternative for Germany (AfD) leader Alice Weidel began with a straight-up untruth: Alice Weidel, according to a claim by the multibillionaire owner of the social media\u00a0platform X, was the most popular chancellor candidate in Germany \"according to the polls.\"\nWeidel's far-right party is actually second in the national opinion polls, 11 points behind the conservative Christian Democratic Union (CDU), and Weidel herself is joint bottom in terms of popularity among Germany's chancellor candidates in the upcoming February 23 election.\nAn Infratest dimap poll also released on Thursday showed that only 20% of Germans are satisfied with Weidel's current performance \u2014 the same as Chancellor Olaf Scholz of the center-left Social Democratic Party, who\u00a0has\u00a0historically low approval ratings.\nThe erroneous introduction from Musk was followed by a rambling 70-minute conversation, occasionally rendered awkward by language-based misunderstandings, that was punctuated with several wildly misleading claims \u2014 at one stage, Musk said that theft was legal in California, while Weidel insisted that Adolf Hitler was a communist.\nTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video\nIn between laughing at each other's jokes, the two also discussed Germany's energy supply, the merits of nuclear power, immigration, the war in Ukraine,\u00a0war in the Middle East\u00a0and other topics.\nMusk expressed his confidence that US President-elect Donald Trump would end the conflicts in Ukraine and the Gaza Strip quickly, while Weidel described what she called the mismanagement of Germany over the last two decades.\nThe pair agreed that the bureaucratic burdens were too great for companies looking to expand operations in Germany \u2014 something that Musk has experienced\u00a0with his Tesla Gigafactory outside Berlin. However, he did acknowledge that both the state and federal governments of Germany had ultimately\u00a0provided a lot of support for the factory.\nIn fact, Musk and Weidel spent much of the conversation agreeing with each other's wild claims. The only moment of minor disagreement came near the beginning, when Musk said he did believe in the benefits of renewable energy, though he thought, like Weidel, that Germany needed to reopen its nuclear plants.\nBut the big question for Weidel was whether the discussion would help her in the upcoming election.\u00a0Though Musk repeated his endorsement of the party, insisting again that only the AfD can \"save\" Germany, political pundits were doubtful that Weidel made a significant impression.\n\"To be honest I'm a bit astounded by how poor her performance was,\" said Bendix H\u00fcgelmann, a German political communications strategist and founder of the consultancy People on the Hill. \"This is a big moment, but ... I think she totally missed the opportunity that was given to her to build on her public profile, and give the impression of a highly-educated, super-sophisticated new prototype of a future right-wing politician.\"\nTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video\nH\u00fcgelmann was also surprised at some of the difficulties Weidel had expressing herself in English. \"She didn't speak poorly, don't get me wrong,\" he said. \"But I think for a 70-minute conversation with Mr. Musk I think she could've prepared a bit better.\"\nThe event did not, H\u00fcgelmann said, compare well with Trump's\u00a0appearance on the Joe Rogan podcast during the US election campaign, when the Republican candidate appeared more relaxed than many had seen him before, and was able to spend three hours reaching a massive online audience.\n\"I think the Joe Rogan interview with Donald Trump lived from this very casual tone that they both found, but from what I heard Ms. Weidel had difficulties matching this American style of getting a nice flow in the conversation,\" said H\u00fcgelmann.\n\"She had a very academic take, which had a huge contrast to the way Mr. Musk presented his arguments. But I would maybe explain this by the language barrier.\"\nAccording to\u00a0figures\u00a0from X, around 200,000 people listened live to the conversation, though the numbers began to fall towards the end, when the talk drifted into Musk's plans for space exploration.\nBut then again, Weidel may still count the talk a success. For Philipp Adorf, political scientist at Bonn University, the main purpose of the event for Weidel was to not to convince a German audience, but to introduce herself to a US audience \u2014 particularly a right-wing audience in and around the corridors of power in Washington.\n\"It was an attempt to stretch out feelers in the US and to make more contact with members of the Trump administration, and perhaps to work together, or at least to be seen as a partner in Europe,\" he said.\nTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video\nHow successful this will be remains open: Contrary to social media rumors ahead of the event, Weidel did not travel to the US to speak to Musk and possibly to attend the inauguration of Trump on January 20. Wednesday's X-based event was an audio-only chat that Weidel joined from her office in Berlin.\nWeidel managed to repeat many of her familiar talking points \u2014 that the CDU's Angela Merkel had in fact been Germany's first \"Green\" chancellor, and that she had ruined the country by opening the border to refugees. But according to Adorf, she may have wanted more time to discuss Germany's domestic issues.\n\"From Weidel's perspective it might have been disappointing that they spoke relatively little about the AfD's main issue: immigration,\" he told DW. \"At the beginning she got a bit caught up in discussing energy policy, which I think is perhaps not super interesting for a larger audience.\"\nWhat she did more successfully, according to Adorf, was present the party as a moderates that merely makes demands that center-right parties used to make.\nBut all in all, he said, the talk\u00a0may have been too casual.\u00a0\"I found the conversation sounded a bit disorganized to me, especially toward\u00a0the end, when Weidel asked Musk what he thought of various issues,\" said Adorf.\nIn this later part of the discussion, the pair drifted into philosophical topics, culminating in Weidel asking Musk whether he believed in God. The science-fiction-obsessed billionaire said he believed in a physics-based approach to divinity, before saying he had an existential crisis at the age of 12 or 13, which was resolved by reading Douglas Adams' 1979 novel \"The Hitchhiker's Guide To The Galaxy.\"\n\"That led me to conclude that we should expand the scope and scale of consciousness, so that we're better able to know what questions to ask about the answers to the universe,\" Musk said. \"We should take the sort of actions that lead to a greater understanding of the universe.\"\nAt this point, Weidel appeared overwhelmed, wrapping up the conversation by\u00a0describing his final words as \"beautiful.\" It remains to be seen whether the AfD's plan to deport thousands of immigrants will lead to the greater understanding that Musk aspires to.\nEdited by: Wesley Dockery\nWhile you're here: Every Tuesday, DW editors round up what is happening in German politics and society.

Weidel criticized former Chancellor Angela Merkel's policies on immigration and nuclear energy, claiming they harmed Germany. Both Musk and Weidel condemned censorship and discussed the Israel-Palestine conflict and the EU's approach to the Russia-Ukraine war. Weidel called the AfD a libertarian conservative party, while Musk emphasized the need for a self-sufficient colony on Mars for humanity's survival.",
            "content": "Tech entrepreneur Elon Musk has hosted a lengthy conversation with the co-chair of the right-wing Alternative for Germany (AfD) party, Alice Weidel. Up to 150 experts were expected to monitor the talk livestreamed on X on Thursday evening for potential violations of Germany\u2019s election laws, according to Politico.\nMusk earlier ruffled feathers in Berlin by praising the AfD\u2019s policies, including its tough stance on immigration. During his talk with Weidel, he reaffirmed his belief that \u201conly AfD can save Germany\u201d ahead of the 2025 parliamentary election.\nMerkel \u2018ruined\u2019 Germany\nWeidel slammed former Chancellor Angela Merkel for her \u2018open-door policy\u2019 during the 2015 migrant crisis, when Germany accepted around 1 million asylum seekers from Africa and the Middle East.\nMerkel \u201cbasically ruined our country,\u201d Weidel stated, arguing that the phaseout of cheap nuclear energy \u201cdestroyed the backbone\u201d of the German economy.\nGermany has shut down its nuclear plants, becoming the only industrial nation to do so, the AfD leader said. In 2011, the German parliament closed the plants in the wake of the Fukushima disaster in Japan. The last reactor was shut down in 2023, two years after Merkel stepped down as chancellor.\nWeidel said Germany should reintroduce nuclear power as a cheaper alternative to green energy promoted by Berlin. Musk, who has described himself as \u201ca big fan of solar energy,\u201d suggested that Germany should not only reopen its nuclear power plants but \u201csignificantly increase\u201d their output.\nImmigration takes toll on taxpayers\nWeidel criticized the government for fostering \u201cimmigration into the social system,\u201d which consumes a significant share of taxpayer money.\nOver 7 million people have arrived in Germany since 2015, the politician claimed, adding that almost 60% of them got rid of their ID papers to complicate potential deportation procedures. She blamed the situation on the lax attitude to migrants during the Merkel era. Musk said the US has to deal with a similar influx of undocumented migrants through its border with Mexico.\nAccording to the German Federal Statistical Office, over 14 million \u2018non-Germans\u2019 arrived in the country from 2015 to 2023. The report did not specify whether they came from other EU nations or from outside the bloc. The federal and regional authorities spent \u20ac6.29 billion ($6.48 billion) as part of the asylum seekers\u2019 benefits program in 2023 alone, according to government data.\nLibertarian conservative party\nThe Alternative for Germany is a \u201clibertarian conservative party\u201d that fights bureaucracy and seeks to \u201cfree the people from the state\u201d by reducing the role of the government in public life, Weidel said.\u00a0 She added that she wants to see \u201cself-confident people\u201d enjoying freedom of speech and generating wealth.\nWeidel complained that her party is being \u201cnegatively framed\u201d by the media. She thanked Musk for a \u201cnormal conversation\u201d\u00a0in which she was not being \u201cinterrupted\u201d on a regular basis.\nShe repeatedly rejected comparisons between AfD and the Nazis, arguing that Adolf Hitler was neither a libertarian nor a conservative.\nCurrent and former AfD members, including Thuringia leader Bjoern Hoecke, have made controversial statements regarding Germany\u2019s Nazi past and have been accused of links to neo-Nazi groups. For this reason, all other major parties have mostly refused to work with the AfD. In 2021, Germany\u2019s domestic security agency (BfV) classified the AfD as a \u201csuspected\u201d extremist group.\u00a0The party unsuccessfully contested the designation in court.\nCensorship is what Hitler did\nMusk and Weidel blasted EU officials for monitoring their conversation and engaging in \u201ccensorship of free speech.\u201d They agreed that free speech is a \u201cbedrock of democracy,\u201d while \u201cextreme censorship\u201d helped Hitler cement his power.\n\u201cFor those who want censorship, I think they should be careful what they ask for because once you institute censorship, it\u2019s only a matter of time before that censorship is turned [against] you,\u201d Musk said.\nIsraeli-Palestinian conflict \u2018complicated\u2019\nWeidel\u00a0expressed support for Israel, describing her party as the \u201conly protector\u201d of Jews in Germany. At the same time, she stressed that the people of Gaza should have access to drinking water and other basic resources.\nThe Israel-Palestine conflict is \u201ccomplicated,\u201d\u00a0and there is not an obvious solution at the moment, she said.\nMusk proposed steps he said would help bring about an end to the fighting, such as the \u201celimination\u201d of Hamas and other forces that seek the \u201cdestruction\u201d of Israel.\u00a0He called for\u00a0\u201cfixing\u201d the Palestinian education system. The Palestinian territories should be prosperous, he said.\n\u201cI think there is great wisdom in forgiveness,\u201d Musk stressed. \u201cIt is the only way to stop the endless cycle of violence.\u201d\nEU \u2018has given up\u2019 and only escalates with Russia\nThe Russia-Ukraine conflict demonstrates how much the EU has\u00a0\u201cgiven up on everything\u201d and\u00a0is reliant on the US, Weidel said. She stated\u00a0that, while the ongoing hostilities are a \u201cbig danger\u201d to European security, the EU has only managed to \u201cescalate the entire conflict [with] Russia.\u201d\n\u201cIt is very dangerous what is going on here,\u201d she stated, adding that EU countries \u201chave no strategy\u201d and \u201cno red lines.\u201d The conflict could \u201cescalate big time towards a nuclear exchange,\u201d she warned.\nMusk expressed hope that US President-elect Donald Trump\u00a0can quickly resolve the crisis, but refused to comment on the incoming administration\u2019s plans. He argued that prolonging the conflict would only weaken Ukraine, which is a \u201csmaller country\u201d and cannot afford major losses.\nColonizing Mars could save\u00a0the human race\nAsked by Weidel about the reasoning behind his desire to colonize Mars, Musk said it\u00a0is a \u201cway to ensure the long-term survival of life as we know it.\u201d The endeavor could preserve humanity in case of a global natural or man-made disaster, he argued. There is an \u201cadded risk for humans that we could destroy ourselves,\u201d Musk said, warning that the \u201cwindow of opportunity\u201d could be shorter than people expect.\nSetting foot on Mars is \u201cnot so much [about] flags and footprints,\u201d but about the establishment of a self-sufficient colony that could require \u201ca million tons of cargo\u201d and a million people,\u00a0Musk said.\nRT News App\n\u00a9 Autonomous Nonprofit Organization \u201cTV-Novosti\u201d, 2005\u20132025.

The party also calls for a crackdown on undocumented migrants, including expelling hundreds of thousands of people.\nThe AfD currently ranks second in the polls with about 19% support behind the CDU-led conservative bloc with 32%. Scholz\u2019s governing Social Democrats rank third with 17% before their coalition partner, the Greens, with 12%.\nThe European Commission said it would monitor the chat and analyze it for any potential breaks of the EU\u2019s Digital Services Act. Germany\u2019s anti-corruption initiative LobbyControl said that the discussion could be viewed as an illegal party donation, since Musk has clearly stated that his goal is to boost the AfD.\nThree AfD state chapters are classified as extremist and are under surveillance by Germany\u2019s domestic intelligence service. The party says Islam doesn\u2019t belong in the country, and former leader Alexander Gauland has called the Nazi period a mere blemish on Germany\u2019s long history.\nMusk largely steered clear of asking critical questions about the AfD\u2019s campaign platform. He did say he was in favor of solar panels after Weidel criticized the introduction of wind and solar energy in Germany. Tesla is a provider of residential power-packs, which store electricity from solar panels and provide a backup during outages.\n\u2014With assistance from Zoe Schneeweiss and Dana Hull.\nPostmedia is committed to maintaining a lively but civil forum for discussion.

It came after weeks of Musk\u2019s efforts to boost the far-right party, which has deep links to neo-Nazism and has been surveilled for suspected extremism by Germany\u2019s own intelligence services.\u201c[Hitler] was a communist, and he considered himself as a socialist,\u201d Weidel said in response to Musk asking about media reports linking the AfD to Nazism.\u201cThe biggest success after that terrible era in our history was to label Adolf Hitler as right[-wing] and conservative, he was exactly the opposite,\u201d Weidel said. \u201cHe wasn't a conservative, he wasn't a libertarian, he was a communist, socialist guy, and we are the opposite.\u201d\u201cRight,\u201d Musk responded.In his autobiography Mein Kampf, Hitler\u2014who as leader of the German Reich was responsible for the invasion of the Soviet Union and the enslavement and death of millions of its citizens\u2014repeatedly describes communism as an enemy of the German nation. He believed that Marxism was a Jewish conspiracy to control Germany and the world.Weidel also compared the Nazi Party\u2019s views to those of modern-day left-wing political groups who support Palestine in the face of what a UN commission has called crimes against humanity conducted by Israel. While her AfD colleagues were last month seen attending a secretive meeting organized by former members of a militant neo-Nazi group known for burning the Israeli flag, she said, \u201cThe AfD is the \u200b\u200bonly protector of the Jewish people here in Germany.\u201dWeidel is the AfD\u2019s candidate for chancellor in Germany\u2019s snap elections, which take place next month. As someone who previously worked in finance and lives in Switzerland with her wife, who is from Sri Lanka, and their children, she has been presented as a relatively moderate face for the party.This is something Musk picked up on in an op-ed he penned last month for a German newspaper.\"The portrayal of the AfD as right-wing extremist is clearly false, considering that Alice Weidel, the party's leader, has a same-sex partner from Sri Lanka,\u201d Musk wrote. \u201cDoes that sound like Hitler to you? Please!\u201dAhead of the conversation on Thursday, the EU said that it would be monitoring the event to see if it was artificially promoted to voters in Germany, something which would be in violation of the region\u2019s sweeping Digital Service Act rules. A European Commission spokesperson told WIRED it would not be commenting on the contents of the livestream.Weidel referenced the EU\u2019s preoccupation with the conversation, claiming 150 officials at the EU commission were listening in, then claimed the DSA was a censorship tool, before adding: \u201cYou know what Adolf Hitler did? He switched off free speech. He controlled the media, and without that he would have never been successful.\u201d\u201cYes, exactly,\u201d Musk responded.The conversation, which was billed as an interview but was more of a love-in, hit virtually event major culture war topic, from the war in Ukraine, where Weidel suggested European government\u2019s lack of strategy would push Russia toward nuclear war, to immigration, where Musk wildly claimed that \u201con the Mexican side of the border in the US is a giant pile of discarded passports and drivers\u2019 licenses, like a huge pile.\u201dIt was unclear what Musk was talking about, and he did not immediately respond to a request for comment.Musk also claimed that \u201cbasically theft is legal in California\u201d and said that the only thing that would slow down what \u201cthe influx of criminals\u201d were stealing is \u201cif your back hurts from carrying out all the goods.\u201dThe centibillionaire\u2019s interest in German politics, and the AfD in particular, appear to have been largely informed by a single X user, Naomi Seibt, a 24-year-old German influencer who rose to prominence by posting climate change and Covid-19 denial content.After she posted an image of herself in June saying she had voted for the AfD in last year\u2019s European elections, Musk shared her post, asking: \u201cWhy is there such a negative reaction from some about AfD?\u201dHe then slid into her DMs, Seibt told Reuters. \"I explained to him the AfD is not similar to the Nazi ideology or Hitler but is like the 19th century liberal nationalist movement ... because they wanted to be free from authoritarians in their own territory,\" Seibt told the outlet.Musk engaged with the 24-year-old 40 more times before sharing one of her posts on December 20 with the comment: \u201cOnly the AfD can save Germany.\u201d A week later an op-ed with Musk\u2019s byline appeared in the German Welt am Samstag newspaper claiming that the AfD was the \u201clast spark of hope\u201d for Germany.Musk repeated his endorsement during the livestream, saying, \u201cI think Alice Weidel is a very reasonable person, and hopefully people can tell just from this conversation. Nothing outrageous is being proposed, just common sense.\u201dIt\u2019s unclear whether Musk\u2019s endorsement of Weidel and the AfD will have any material impact on the outcome of the election.\u201cIn the first survey we conducted this year, we found that this has not yet benefited the AfD,\u201d Manfred G\u00fcllner, the head of the Forsa Institute, told Politico. \u201cI don\u2019t see very much potential for future change, because Musk has become a negative figure.\u201d",

European officials are considering regulatory responses to Musk's interference in German politics.",
            "content": "Elon Musk is not just dabbling in German politics. He is attempting to break a political blockade that has kept the nation\u2019s most prominent far-right party out of government even as it has gained strength with voters.\nMr. Musk will be the host of a live interview on Thursday with Alice Weidel, who is the chancellor candidate for that party, the Alternative for Germany, known as the AfD, in the country\u2019s snap election scheduled for Feb. 23. The event, on X, the social media platform that Mr. Musk owns, has raised alarms and threats of legal consequences among Germany\u2019s political class.\nThat is, in large part, because Mr. Musk is offering the AfD a level of publicity and legitimacy that it has long been denied in German public life.\nThe AfD has risen to the second position in German national polls, backed by about a fifth of the electorate. It has gained support with an unwavering anti-establishment campaign, which rails against the millions of migrants and refugees who have entered the country over the last decade from the Middle East and Ukraine.\nParties with similar immigration messages elsewhere in Europe, like the Brothers of Italy and Austria\u2019s Freedom Party, have risen to federal power. But in Germany, still haunted by its Nazi past, no other party will work with the AfD. Its candidates complain they receive far less airtime than other candidates on the nation\u2019s political talk shows.\nAt the same time, the AfD has made forays into language and actions German leaders deem extreme. The party has been forced to expel members for using racist and antisemitic language. One of its leaders has been repeatedly penalized by German courts for repeating banned Nazi slogans.\nThe party is under observation by domestic intelligence. Three of its state chapters as well as its entire youth wing are classified as confirmed right-extremist, a designation that intelligence services make after extensive observation. More than 100 employees working for AfD members of Parliament are also confirmed right extremists, according to an investigation by a public broadcaster.\nIn a 2016 speech, with the AfD gaining steam before federal elections, former Chancellor Angela Merkel urged all German parties to unite against the AfD. It was, she said, not just a problem for her own conservative party but \u201ca challenge for all of us gathered in this house.\u201d\nThe anti-AfD collective has not broken since. Not after the party climbed in the polls and won victories in major state elections last year, and not after it tried to put a more moderate face forward as its chancellor candidate: Ms. Weidel, a former investment banker who lives with her Sri Lankan same-sex partner and their children in Switzerland.\nEnter Mr. Musk, who controls a powerful media platform that is increasingly populated with right-wing influencers. He has become a close confidant of President-elect Donald J. Trump and in online posts has begun promoting far-right candidates and parties across Europe.\nIn December, Mr. Musk reposted a video from Naomi Seibt, a 24-year-old German conservative social media star who has gained a large following on X and on YouTube, through her harsh criticisms of climate scientists and efforts to combat global warming. She is also close with the AfD, and appears to have helped sway Mr. Musk to support the party.\n\u201cOnly the AfD can save Germany,\u201d Mr. Musk wrote, in his post, which included one of her videos.\nMs. Weidel welcomed the support. \u201cYou are perfectly right, @elonmusk!\u201d she wrote in response.\nMr. Musk has since written an opinion piece in the German newspaper Die Welt expounding on his support for the party, which he called the \u201clast spark of hope\u201d for Germany. In it, he cast the AfD not as extreme, but as a reasonable alternative to a calcified political establishment.\n\u201cThe portrayal of the AfD as far-right is clearly wrong considering that Alice Weidel, the leader of the party, has a same-sex partner from Sri Lanka! Does that sound like Hitler to you? Come on!\u201d he wrote.\nOn Thursday evening in Germany, Mr. Musk will go even further, playing host to Ms. Weidel in an X \u201cSpaces\u201d conversation, akin to one he held with Mr. Trump last summer.\nMr. Musk, and many of his X users, are fascinated with European right-wing political parties like the AfD. But in many ways the party\u2019s positions diverge from Mr. Musk\u2019s personal and business views \u2014 and his role as an adviser to Mr. Trump.\nThe AfD has famously fought back against the construction of a factory in Germany for Tesla, the electric car company also run by Mr. Musk. In an interview with The American Conservative this week, Ms. Weidel praised Mr. Trump, but she suggested that Germans have become \u201cslaves\u201d to the United States, including aiding America in wars over the last 30 years.\n\u201cWe Germans have lived in this situation for a long time, definitely to the advantage of the U.S.,\u201d she said.\nThe European Commission has said it will examine Mr. Musk\u2019s interference in European politics given his enormous power through his ownership of X and his close ties, however impermanent they may turn out to be, to the incoming American president.\nEurope\u2019s center-left political parties \u2014 Germany\u2019s Social Democrats among them \u2014 have jointly released a statement urging Brussels to use \u201call the legal means available\u201d to protect democracy against misinformation and foreign interference on social media.\nG\u00e9rard Araud, an outspoken former French ambassador to Washington, has doubts about Europe\u2019s ability to keep its unity in withstanding attacks from Mr. Musk on incumbent leaders.\n\u201cEuropeans, for whom the relationship with the United States is civilizational and existential, are paralyzed by the increasingly incendiary statements of Trump and Musk,\u201d Mr. Araud wrote on X. \u201cThey hope that these are just words.\u201d\nGerman leaders have alternately criticized Mr. Musk and tried to ignore him. In an interview this week, Chancellor Olaf Scholz dismissed the billionaire\u2019s efforts to sway German voters. \u201cI do not believe in courting Mr. Musk\u2019s favor,\u201d he said. When dealing with social media posts, he added in English, his rule is, \u201cDon\u2019t feed the troll.\u201d\nGerman voters also appear unswayed, at least for now. Three quarters of respondents to a German broadcaster\u2019s poll said it was inappropriate for Mr. Musk to comment on German politics.\nBut the same poll showed a majority of respondents believed that Mr. Musk\u2019s efforts would help the AfD in the election.\nThe post  Elon Musk Is Trying to Break Germany\u2019s Quarantine on the Far-Right AfD  appeared first on New York Times.\nCopyright \u00a9 2023.\nCopyright \u00a9 2023.",

            "content": "Elon Musk has picked sides in the upcoming German election, holding a controversial open-mic session on X with far-right AfD chancellor candidate Alice Weidel. What do the facts say about their claims?\nAlice Weidel, the leader of the far-right Alternative for Germany party (AfD), discussed German politics and more on Thursday during an audio chat on X with\u00a0US billionaire\u00a0Elon Musk, who owns the social media platform.\nThe public conversation between the two, which was followed live by around 200,000 people, had been eagerly awaited but also sharply criticized by other German politicians and parties.\nDuring the chat, AfD leader\u00a0Weidel told Musk what she thinks is going wrong in Germany. Musk was impressed \u2014 and renewed his election recommendation for the AfD as the \"only party that can save Germany.\"\nTheir conversation lasted more than an hour. Here are some of the most controversial claims, and what the facts say.\nTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video\nThe claim:\u00a0Musk presented\u00a0Weidel in the title of his X\u00a0Space chat as \"the leading candidate to run Germany.\"\nThe facts:\u00a0If Musk meant to suggest that Weidel was leading in opinion polls, his claim was not correct.\u00a0Weidel's\u00a0far-right\u00a0AfD\u00a0is currently in second place, according to a survey\u00a0ahead of the\u00a0February 23 federal election in Germany.\nThe center-right CDU and its Bavarian sister party, the\u00a0CSU, are currently the strongest political force in Germany\u00a0with\u00a031% suppoert, based on the most recent polling from\u00a0ARD Deutschlandtrend. The AfD is polling at around 20%.\nNeither is Weidel leading as an individual candidate.\nBased on the same nationwide survey, which is conducted by Infratest dimap, Weidel placed in fifth\u00a0when it comes to satisfaction with the work of various candidates.\nOnly 20% of respondents said they were satisfied with Weidel as a candidate for chancellor. She was behind Robert Habeck, the chancellor candidate for the environmentalist Greens at 28%, the CDU's Friedrich Merz at 25%, Sarah Wagenknecht, with her own new eponymous party BSW at 21%\u00a0and the business-focused\u00a0FDP's Christian Lindner, also at 21%.\nOlaf Scholz, the incumbent German chancellor from the center-left SPD, ranked similarly to Weidel, although\u00a0other polls\u00a0have shown her ahead of Merz and Scholz. Nevertheless, most polls do not show Weidel with a chance of winning the German election\nThe claim:\u00a0During her talk\u00a0with the Musk on\u00a0X,\u00a0Weidel claimed, \"Germany is the only industrial country that unplugged the nuclear power plant.\"\nThe facts:\u00a0Italy shut down its nuclear plants more than three decades before Germany. Shortly after the Chernobyl disaster, a nationwide\u00a0referendum\u00a0was held in Italy in 1987. According to the archives\u00a0of the Italian Interior Ministry,\u00a0nearly 80% of participants voted in favor of shutting down the country's nuclear plants. By 1990, Italy had phased out all its existing nuclear facilities.\nBy\u00a0comparison, Germany closed its last remaining nuclear plants in 2023.\nThe claim:\u00a0Weidel claimed during the X-Space chatt\u00a0that \"nuclear energy supply is carbon-free.\"\nThe facts:\u00a0Nuclear energy is considered a carbon-free source of electricity by some institutions,\u00a0because it does not produce carbon dioxide (CO2) or other greenhouse gases during its operation. That is why some political parties like Weidel's AfD critisize the decision to phase out\u00a0nuclear energy, as some see nuclear power as an alternative for the energy mix in Germany.\nBut considering the entire life cycle of a nuclear plant, nuclear energy does produce\u00a0emissions.\u00a0The life cycle emissions of nuclear power plants include all stages from uranium mining\u00a0to plant construction, operation, decommissioning\u00a0and waste management.\nNuclear energy certainly has lower CO2 emissions than coal or natural gas, but it is not \"carbon free.\"\nThe figures on how much CO2 a nuclear power plant generates per kilowatt-hour vary: In 2014,\u00a0an IPCC report\u00a0estimated a range from 4 to 110 grams of CO2 equivalent per kilowatt-hour (kWh) \u2014\u00a0so it's not carbon neutral.\nA\u00a0UK-based study\u00a0found that nuclear power has a minimal carbon footprint of around\u00a015\u201350 grams of CO2\u00a0per kilowatt hour.\nThe processes to mine and refine uranium ore\u00a0require huge amounts of energy, often from fossil fuels. And the construction of a nuclear plant, with the large amounts of concrete and steel needed, is also\u00a0a significant cause of CO2 emissions.\nThe claim:\u00a0\"Without asking the people, she [Angela Merkel]\u00a0enforced to open our borders to illegal immigration,\"\u00a0Weidel said during the live talk.\nThe facts:\u00a0Weidel is referring to the events of early September 2015,\u00a0when thousands of refugees, many coming from Syria, made their way from Hungary to Germany via Austria. Then-Chancellor Angela Merkel decided not to close the border to stop them and temporarily suspended rules which would have meant return to the first EU country or safe transit country. This decision has been highly debated ever since.\nThe claim that Merkel \"opened\"\u00a0the borders\u00a0is not accurate.\u00a0In 2015, all of Germany\u2018s neighboring countries were part of the so-called Schengen area, meaning there were no border controls between any of those countries and Germany. Later, in 2021, the rules for border controls were changed by the EU in its communication\"A strategy towards a fully functioning and resilient Schengen area.\"\nOn\u00a0September 13, 2015, the German government instituted temporary border controls with Austria.\nThere has been political debate about whether or not the government should have stopped the refugees from entering Germany in the first place. The country\u2018s immigration law states that foreigners shall be refused entry if they enter from a safe third country, which includes Austria.\nThe German government has argued that it acted in accordance with the EU\u2019s Dublin III regulations on immigration, which allow a state to examine someone's asylum application, even if it is not obliged to.\nIn 2017, the European Court of Justiceconfirmed that EU states may indeed take in asylum-seekers voluntarily, but that such border crossings may still be illegal under the Dublin Regulation.\nThe claim:\u00a0\"Theft is legal in California,\" Musk claimed, adding\u00a0that if stolen goods are below $1,000 (around \u20ac970), thieves allegedly won't be prosecuted.\nThe facts:\u00a0Theft is not legal in California, as\u00a0can be seen for example in this\u00a0press release\u00a0by the state's governor, reporting about a statewide enforcement operation targeting organized retail theft crime.\nThe claim, which has previously been stated by US President-elect\u00a0Donald Trump,\u00a0refers to Proposition 47, a significant criminal justice reform approved by California voters in 2014, which aimed to reduce penalties for certain theft and drug possession offenses.\nUnder\u00a0Proposition 47,\u00a0which was passed in 2014, the theft of goods valued at $950 or less are classified as a misdemeanor, not a felony. This reclassification was part of a broader criminal justice reform effort aimed at reducing prison overcrowding. However, theft under $950 is still illegal and punishable by up to six months in jail and fines of up to $1,000.\nProposition 47 did not decriminalize theft but changed how crimes are prosecuted. The law eliminated the discretion of prosecutors to charge theft under $950 as a felony, except in cases involving repeat offenders or certain aggravating circumstances.\nWhile enforcement may be constrained in some cases due to practical considerations like jail overcrowding, law enforcement agencies and the California Highway Patrol continue to target theft, especially organized retail crime.\nFor instance, statewide operations in December continued to lead to arrests, recovery of stolen goods, and measures to deter retail theft.\nThe claim: \"In Germany, we had an influx of almost 7 million people, but these are the officially counted ones,\" Weidel claimed, while accusing the German government of wasting money on immigration and blaming it for unregulated, illegal migration.\nImmediately after that, Weidel shifted the discussion toward undocumented migrants who enter Germany without a passport, failing to clearly distinguish between them and other categories of migrants.\nThe facts:\u00a0The figure Weidel cited \u2014 an \"influx of 7 million people\" \u2014 is roughly in line with official data on migration to Germany. According to the Federal Statistical Office,\u00a0this number reflects total migration figures since 2015.\nHowever, Weidel's statement is misleading because it conflates different types of migration. It groups together legal migration, such as skilled workers and business owners, with asylum-seekers.\nAccording to Eurostat, Germany has received approximately 3 million asylum applications since 2015, with some applications ultimately being rejected.\nAnna Bakovic contributed to this fact check.\nEdited by: Wesley Dockery",

            "content": "As Germany gears for a general election, Elon Musk and Alice Weidel chatted about a range of topics, inluding energy, Ukraine, migration and education. DW checked the facts.\nX owner Elon Musk spoke with the co-leader and chancellor candidate of the Alternative for Germany party (AfD), Alice Weidel, in a live conversation on his social media platform.\nWith early elections set for February 23, Weidel's AfD is polling in second place among the parties, somewhere in the region of 20%.\nGermany's established political parties have, however, all ruled out cooperating with the AfD in potential federal coalitions, meaning Weidel and the party's prospects of governing are poor.\nThis blog is now closed. Scroll through for fact-checking of some of the claims raised during the talk, explainers and reactions.\nMarietje Schaake, a fellow at Stanford University and the author of the book \"The Tech Coup, How To Save Democracy From Silicon Valley,\" called\u00a0the talk between tech billionaire Elon Musk and AfD leader Alice Weidel\u00a0\"very awkward, uncomfortable and underwhelming.\"\nShe also added\u00a0that there were not that many people and she had expected a bigger audience.\u00a0\"I think all the fears about this having a major impact are probably not going to be substantiated,\" the expert\u00a0added.\nSchaake said that Musk is platforming far-right politicians and parties, not only through the streams, but also \"through the algorithm, through the ranking and the curation of information on his platform, which is very influential.\"\nIt remains to be seen whether that will have a big impact, Schaake said.\u00a0\"But I think the fact that he (Musk), as a confidant of President Trump, is trying to support these fringe parties, these far-right anti-establishment populist parties, says a lot,\" she added.\n\"And we must see it as being condoned by Trump, endorsed by Trump and really as a precursor for a dramatic change in the trans-Atlantic relation,\" Schaake stressed.\nTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video\nThe claim:\"[Angela Merkel] enforced, without asking the people, she enforced to open our borders to illegal immigration,\u201c Alice Weidel said during the live talk.\nThe facts: Alice Weidel is referring to the events of early September 2015, when thousands of refugees made their way from Hungary to Germany via Austria. Then-Chancellor Angela Merkel decided not to close the border to stop them and temporarily suspended rules which would have meant return to the first EU country or safe transit country. This decision has been highly debated ever since.\nThe claim that Merkel \"opened\"\u00a0the borders, is not accurate: In 2015, all of Germany\u2018s neighboring countries were part of the so-called Schengen area,\u00a0meaning that there were no border controls between any of those countries and Germany.\nOn 13 September 2015, the German government instituted temporary border controls with Austria.\nThere has been debate about whether or not the government should have stopped the refugees from entering Germany in the first place. The country\u2018s immigration law states that foreigners shall be refused entry if they enter from a safe third country, which Austria is.\nThe German government has argued that it acted in accordance with the EU\u2019s Dublin III Regulations on immigration, which allow a state to examine someone\u2019s asylum application even if it is not obliged to.\nThe European Court of Justice in 2017 confirmed that EU states may indeed take in asylum seekers voluntarily, but that such border crossings may still be illegal under the Dublin Regulation.\nThe far-right\u00a0Alternative for Germany (AfD) secured just over 30% of the vote in recent state\u00a0elections in Thuringia and Saxony, which was partly\u00a0attributed to the party's effectiveness at reaching first-time voters on TikTok.\nA study last year showed that politicians and figures linked to the AfD used TikTok as a \"parallel universe\" to spread extremism, while other German parties show \"weak performance\" on the platform.\nThis campaigning strategy, with a heavy focus on social media messaging and avenues traditional political campaigning might not reach, is also reminiscent of Donald Trump's own tactics.\nRead DW's analysis on how social media can shape Germany's election campaign.\nThe claim: Alice Weidel claimed during the Space with Musk, that \"nuclear energy supply is carbon-free.\"\nThe facts: By some institutions nuclear energy is considered a carbon-free source of electricity because it does not produce carbon dioxide (CO2) or other greenhouse gases during its operation.\u00a0But considering the entire life cycle of a nuclear plant, nuclear energy produces emissions. The life cycle emissions of nuclear power plants include all stages from uranium mining to plant construction, operation, decommissioning, and waste management. Nuclear energy certainly has lower CO2 emissions than coal or natural gas, but it is not \"carbon free.\"\nThe figures on how much CO2 a nuclear power plant generates per kilowatt-hour vary: In 2014, an IPCC report estimated a range from 4 to 110 grams of CO2 equivalent per kilowatt-hour (kWh) \u2013 so not carbon neutral.\nA\u00a0UK-based study found that nuclear power has a minimal carbon footprint of around\u00a015\u201350 grams of CO2\u00a0per kilowatt hour.\nThe processes to mine and refine uranium ore require huge amounts of energy, often from fossil fuels. And the construction of a nuclear plant, with the large amounts of concrete and steel needed, is also\u00a0a significant cause of CO2 emissions.\nThe claim:\u00a0Elon Musk presented Alice Weidel in the title of his Space as \"the leading candidate to run Germany.\"\nThe facts:\u00a0Alice Weidel's\u00a0far-right Alternative for Germany party (AfD)\u00a0is in second place according to surveys ahead of the upcoming federal elections in Germany.\nThe center-right CDU and CSU, which are running together are currently the strongest political force in Germany with\u00a031%, based on the most recent polling,\u00a0the ARD Deutschlandtrend. The AfD is polling at around 20%.\nIn terms of individual candidates, Musk's description of Alice Weidel was not correct. Based on the same nationwide survey, which is conducted by infratest-dimap, Alice Weidel came in fifth\u00a0when it comes to satisfaction with the work of various candidates.\nOnly 20% of respondents said they were satisfied with Alice Weidel as a candidate for chancellor. She was behind Robert Habeck, the chancellor candidate for the Greens on\u00a028%, the CDU's Friedrich Merz on\u00a025%, Sarah Wagenknecht, with her own new eponymous party BSW on\u00a021%,\u00a0and the pro-business FDP's Christian Lindner also on\u00a021%.\nOlaf Scholz, the incumbent German chancellor from the center-left SPD, ranked similarly to Weidel, although other polls have shown her ahead of Merz and Scholz. Nevertheless, most polls do not show Weidel with a chance of winning the German election.\nSeveral of the questions Weidel put to Musk in the final minutes of the conversation pertained to his stated desire to colonize Mars.\nHe initially ducked the question of when he hoped for a first crewed mission to the Red Planet, but said \"it is just a matter of time before we are annihilated\" if humanity does not become a \"multi-planetary species.\"\nMusk later said the next window for a mission would be in roughly two years, adding that this window might be viable for an uncrewed mission.\nWeidel also asked Musk if he believed in God, following up on comments he'd made about how the elements making up human bodies ultimately hail from stars that exploded billions of years ago. She asked if he believed it was possible for this to be a coincidence.\nNeither of the speakers went on to offer a firm position themselves. Musk said he was \"open to the idea\" of \"some entity that you could call God,\" but less so on one \"observing our daily actions and rendering a verdict day-to-day.\" Weidel, meanwhile, said \"I'm still on a search\" and \"I don't know what to believe,\" saying she was \"agnostic maybe.\"\nClaim:\u00a0\"Theft is legal in California,\"\u00a0Elon Musk claimed, adding\u00a0that if stolen goods are below $1,000 (around \u20ac970), thieves allegedly won't be prosecuted.\nThe facts: Theft is not legal in California, as\u00a0can be seen for example in this press release by the Governor of the state reporting about a statewide enforcement operation targeting organized retail theft crime.\nThe claim, which has previously been stated by\u00a0Donald Trump, refers to Proposition 47, a significant criminal justice reform approved by California voters in 2014, aimed to reduce penalties for certain theft and drug possession offenses.\nUnder Proposition 47, which was passed in 2014, theft of goods valued at $950 or less is classified as a misdemeanor, not a felony. This reclassification was part of a broader criminal justice reform effort aimed at reducing prison overcrowding. However, theft under $950 is still illegal and punishable by up to six months in jail and fines up to $1,000.\nProposition 47 did not decriminalize theft but changed how crimes are prosecuted. The law eliminated the discretion of prosecutors to charge theft under $950 as a felony, except in cases involving repeat offenders or certain aggravating circumstances.\u00a0While enforcement may be constrained in some cases due to practical considerations like jail overcrowding, law enforcement agencies and the California Highway Patrol continue to target theft, especially organized retail crime.\nFor instance, statewide operations in December continued to lead to arrests, recovery of stolen goods, and measures to deter retail theft.\nAround 40 minutes into the discussion, Musk alluded both to Germany's Nazi past and to the AfD's common categorization as a far-right party, asking Weidel to comment on this.\nShe said her party was a \"conservative\" and \"libertarian\" one unfairly branded as extreme domestically.\nThe AfD is facing investigation as a potential far-right extremist group, and unsuccessfully appealed against this process earlier in the year. Those supporting this claim will often point to the comments and actions of party leaders deemed more extreme than Weidel\u00a0 when making\u00a0their case.\nWeidel also claimed, using a trope that's rather more common in the English-speaking world than it is in Germany, that Adolf Hitler was not right-wing, but rather left-wing.\nPointing to his command economy policies and heavy state spending, as he geared Germany up for rapid rearmament and war with almost all of Europe, Weidel argued that the keyword defining Hitler and the Nazis was \"Socialist,\" not the word \"National\" that they saw fit to put in front of it when naming themselves.\nHitler himself had said at the time that he wanted to reclaim the term socialism from the \"Marxists,\" who he argued had sullied what could be a viable big-state economic policy basis.\nClaim: During her talks with the US billionaire Elon Musk on the social media platform X, the AfD leader Alice Weidel claimed, \"Germany is the only industrial country that unplugged the nuclear power plant.\"\nThe facts: Italy shut its nuclear plants more than three decades before Germany. Shortly after the Chernobyl disaster, a nationwide referendum was held in Italy in 1987. According to the Italian Interior Ministry's archives, nearly 80% of participants voted in favor of shutting down the country's nuclear plants. By 1990, Italy had phased out all its existing nuclear facilities. In comparison, Germany closed its last remaining nuclear plants in 2023.\nBetween 100,000 and 200,000 people tuned in for the discussion, according to X's own online statistics. An audience of around 100,000 nearer the start of the conversation cleared 200,000 just after half past the hour.\nThe opening quarter of an hour was spent in large part discussing German energy policy, after Weidel referred to former Chancellor Angela Merkel as \"Germany's first green chancellor\", seemingly in reference to her push for more renewable energy, a move that began long before Merkel's tenure.\nWeidel was critical of usage of solar and wind power, a notion Musk sought to push back against somewhat.\nShe also said that Germany's reliance on Russian gas had been exposed amid the invasion of Ukraine, and criticized the use of coal temporarily to plug gaps.\nWeidel\u00a0claimed that Merkel had \"ruined our country,\" primarily because of high migration in and since 2015.\nShe also complained about her party's public treatment in the \"mainstream media\" in Germany.\nIn a discussion you could kindly categorize as free-flowing or less kindly as unstructured, the pair\u00a0also covered topics like German schoolchildren struggling in international PISA studies, with Weidel alleging the falling German scores could be traced to topics like \"socialist gender things\" dominating time in class.\nTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video\nThe discussion between Musk and Weidel started roughly on time just after 7 p.m. German time.\nEven its\u00a0heading on Musk's X account was rather misleading for those tuning in unfamiliar with German politics.\n\"Conversation with the leading candidate to run Germany,\" the discussion was initially billed as.\nWeidel is the AfD's leading candidate to run Germany. She's also at the head of the party with a realistic chance of coming second, if a rather distant second, based on current polls.\nHowever her chances of becoming chancellor after the vote on February 23, with roughly 20% public support and nobody willing to be a coalition partner, are virtually nil barring a political earthquake.\nEven prior to Thursday evening's online discussion, the German Bundestag parliament's\u00a0administrative arm is eying it as a potential violation of campaign financing rules.\nThe Bundestagsverwaltung said on Thursday that it would monitor the discussion in case it violated rules on influencing the upcoming election or party campaign donations.\nAnalysts quoted in Thursday's papers in Germany expressed skepticism about the potential for\u00a0rule breaches emerging in these areas. They pointed to factors like\u00a0the discussion being aired without charge and also to free speech laws that would cover Musk repeating an endorsement of the AfD or Weidel.\nHowever, the Lobby Control group, which campaigns for the reduced influence of lobbyists in German and EU politics,\u00a0argues that manipulating X's algorithms to boost the discussion's prominence and reach could constitute an illegal campaign donation.\nAurel Eschmann from Lobby Control told DW that Musk's account's \"reach is much higher than for a user with a similar follower count that isn't the owner of X.\"\n\"And since the\u00a0service of this boost in reach is supplied to the party AfD for free, this would constitute a party donation,\" he argued.\nA spokesperson for Weidel referred to the online event as an \"unprepared and open discussion,\" also saying that the pair had yet to meet.\nThe AfD faced a large fine for illegal campaign funding a few years ago that dated back to the 2016 state elections in Baden W\u00fcrttemberg in the southwest.\nTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video\nAs of mid-December, the far-right party was polling at nearly 20%, second among the parties, behind\u00a0the conservative CDU. That's nearly double its 2021 general election result.\nThe AfD has poached voters from all the other major parties except the Greens, and has simultaneously succeeded in mobilizing many non-voters.\nThe party scores best among middle-income to low-income earners \u2014\u00a0though that is by no means its exclusive voter base, and draws voters from across social classes. It is especially successful in Germany's east. Its membership, meanwhile, has one significant feature \u2014\u00a0only 17%\u00a0are women.\nFounded in\u00a02013\u00a0as a euroskeptic party,\u00a0the AfD has since risen to\u00a0the federal as well as every state parliament\u00a0in regional elections as well as the European parliament.\nIt was originally created by a group of neo-liberal academics as a protest against the single European currency. They were\u00a0angered specifically\u00a0by then-Chancellor Angela Merkel's decision to bail out Greece in 2010 following Europe's financial crisis.\nBut following Germany's move to welcome refugees mainly from war-torn Syria in 2015, the party\u00a0set an\u00a0overtly nationalist, anti-immigrant, anti-Islam agenda.\nRead more on Germamy's political parties.\nAlice Weidel belongs to a very small minority. She is one of nine women in the parliamentary group of the AfD\u00a0\u2014\u00a069 men make up the rest.\nShe co-chairs both the party itself and its parliamentary group, together with Tino Chrupalla. Weidel also ran on a joint ticket with Chrupalla in the last federal election\u00a0in 2021. The result back then was disappointing for the AfD: they won 10.3%, down from 12.6% in 2017.\nThe\u00a045-year-old\u00a0has a doctorate in economics.\u00a0In the late 2000s, she worked at the Bank of China\u00a0and lived in China for six years where she learned to speak Mandarin.\nWeidel has previously expressed admiration\u00a0of Margaret Thatcher, Britain's prime minister from 1979 to 1990.\nHer private life has been used by Musk to dismiss the far-right label of the AfD, as she\u00a0lives in a civil partnership with a woman who originally comes from Sri Lanka. Together, they have two adopted children.\nThat lifestyle is\u00a0a far cry from the AfD's ideals. In the party's manifesto, the party is committed to the model of the traditional family, one in which\u00a0\"mother and father take permanent joint responsibility for their children.\"\nThe AfD's candidate for chancellor lives in Germany and Switzerland. Read more on her political views.\nManfred Weber, leader of the EPP conservative bloc in the European Parliament, has told DW that it is not in Elon Musk's business interests to support Germany's far-right AfD.\nHe also said Germany and Europe should be more self-confident, and not take everything the Tesla and\u00a0SpaceX founder says \"too seriously.\"\nTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video",

Their major disagreement was whether the blessings and virtues of socialism should be cultivated as an exclusive national advantage (\u201cNational Socialists,\u201d aka NAZIs), or be the subject of a global program of proselytization (\u201cInternational Socialists,\u201d or COMINTERN).\nWhen Hitler lost, Russia \u201cre-educated\u201d the East German socialists to the international view. That was a minor alteration, compared to what the West Germans had to undergo to become \u201cwestern capitalists\u201d once more.\nWhen the wall finally came down, it did not so much free the oppressed as it let out the locusts. And they and their obsessions (\u201copen\u201d globalist borders, \u201cgreen\u201d control over private property) conquered Germany\u2019s government once more, just like before.\nToday, the German socialists running the government are frantically attempting to use laws designed to prevent another Hitler (which is humorous, because those laws didn\u2019t prevent them) to denounce a new \u201ccharismatic opinion leader.\u201d And some of these laws (such as the ones that explicitly criminalize certain types of political and social speech, commentary, and even opinion) go out of their way to impose extremely undemocratic \u201cwrong solutions\u201d to this purported goal. And all of their attempts are failing badly, because the new leader is a proponent of greater freedom and not collectivist subservience to the \u201cgreater good\u201d of the socialist elites, be they modern or Reich vintage..\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nBobM in reply to henrybowman.\n\n  |\n            January 11, 2025 at 7:41 pm\n\n\nWas stationed (US Army) in Berlin in the 80s, slapped in the face with the many many memorials to those murdered trying to flee E Germany over The Wall I was well inoculated from any belief in the joys of socialism.\nMany forget that when e Germany collapsed a lot of e German rice bowls went away.

            "summary": "The European Union is accelerating its investigation into social media platform X for potential violations of the Digital Services Act (DSA) related to content moderation. This follows CEO Elon Musk's endorsement of far-right German politician Alice Weidel, which raised concerns about algorithmic bias. The EU's probe includes scrutiny of X's verification system and its transparency measures. Musk has rejected an alleged \"illegal secret deal\" with the EU. The DSA aims to regulate Big Tech and ensure user safety. Other platforms like TikTok and Meta are also under scrutiny for similar compliance issues.",
            "content": "MEDIANAMA\nTechnology and policy in India\nThe European Union (EU) is focusing on speeding up its investigation into social media platform X\u2019s violation of content moderation and other provisions outlined by the Digital Services Act, 2022 (DSA), Bloomberg reported. In a letter addressed to EU lawmakers, it was revealed that the probe would be completed \u201cas early as legally possible\u201d.\nThe letter followed X CEO Elon Musk\u2019s endorsement of German far-right leader Alice Weidel on the platform. The European Commission (EC) will monitor whether X\u2019s algorithms would \u201cdeliberately boost\u201d the live-stream conversation between the two, as detailed by Musk\u2019s post. This could violate the DSA, cited Bloomberg.\nThe EC opened the formal proceedings for the case in December 2023, after the conclusion of a preliminary investigation analysing multiple sources like X\u2019s Transparency and risk assessment reports. Further, the Commission also requested the platform to furnish information about the dissemination of illegal content like Hamas\u2019 terrorist attacks against Israel. The scrutiny focused on the following areas:\nIn July 2024, the Commission\u2019s preliminary findings disclosed that X\u2019s paid verification system deceived users and prohibited them from truly verifying an account\u2019s legitimacy. Malicious actors also used the platform\u2019s \u201cBlue checkmark\u201d verification system to mislead other users. Further, about transparency measures, the EC stated that X had placed design features and access barriers to make its advertisement repository \u2018unfit for transparency purpose\u2019. Besides this, X also compelled researchers to pay disproportionally high fees by granting access only through its application programming interface (API) and otherwise discouraging them from conducting projects. This was in addition to the platform purportedly prohibiting eligible researchers from independently accessing its public data, contradicting its terms of service.\nResponding to these findings, Musk said that the EC had offered it an \u201cillegal secret deal\u201d stopping them from being fined if they censored speech. However, Musk claimed that X rejected this deal, while other platforms obliged.\nIn 2022, soon after his takeover of X (formerly Twitter), Musk reinstated former U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s account on the platform. For context, X had permanently suspended the infamous right-wing politician from holding an account, citing the \u201crisk of further incitement of violence\u201d and taking into account Trump\u2019s previous tweets. However, Musk has time and again associated himself with the right-wing ideology and is now seeking to influence global politics.\nAs Germany looks to its federal elections scheduled for February 2025, Musk has now turned to support the country\u2019s far-right party. Noting Trump\u2019s possible influence on the electoral process, France also recently appealed to the EC to use its tools to \u2018discourage such behaviour\u2019 or in case of inaction, enable EU\u2019s member states to take action instead.\nIn addition to X, the DSA has been used to initiate scrutiny against social media companies like TikTok and Meta. The Act aims to create a safer digital space, respecting the fundamental rights of all users and to rein in the power of the four Big Tech overlords: Google, Facebook, Apple, and Amazon. It lays down several obligations for intermediaries including social media platforms relating to transparency, user safeguards, and bans on targeted advertising and dark patterns, among others.\nRecently, the European Commission also rejected Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg\u2019s claim that its data laws (like the DSA) censored social media and instead argued that it only mandated large platforms to remove illegal content. EU issued this statement in response to Zuckerberg\u2019s comments during his broader announcement about loosening Meta\u2019s content moderation policies.\nAlso Read:\nSupport our journalism:\nSign up for our Daily Newsletter to receive regular updates\nStay informed about MediaNama events\nHave something to tell us?

It is currently polling second ahead of general elections on Feb. 23 on a platform that includes \"defending freedom of speech,\" tighter asylum laws, ending financial support for asylum seekers, and the reversal of planned restrictions on combustion engine cars among other points.\nDespite the party's classification as a \"suspected extremist organization\" by German domestic intelligence services \u2014 which it has tried to fight in court \u2014 Musk in December said that \"only the AfD can save Germany,\" and published an opinion piece in support of the party in a German newspaper.\n\"Don't feed the troll,\" outgoing German Chancellor Olaf Scholz told German weekly publication Stern when asked about Musk's attack on himself and other politicians from the country, while German opposition leader Friedrich Merz called Musk's interference \"intrusive and pretentious\" when speaking to Funke media group.\nThe outrage has crossed borders, with French President Emmanuel Macron also criticizing Musk and former European Commissioner Thierry Breton,\u00a0saying the interview would give Weidel a \"significant and valuable advantage.\"\nYet the livestream would not break any laws if the content of the interview is legal, Matthew Holman, a tech, privacy and AI partner at law firm Cripps told CNBC in emailed comments, noting that it was \"an important part of the expression of free speech in a healthy democratic system.\"\n\"However, if it were the only interview that Musk conducted with German parties then, by failing to give equal prominence to all mainstream views or promoting one party in a polarising manner, it may be that lawmakers perceive X and Musk have negatively affected civic discourse and the electoral process in Germany by only interviewing the AfD or failing to have an effective third party real-time moderator,\" Holman added.\nCNBC has reached out to X for comment.\nThe European Union's Digital Services Act (DSA) \u2014 a wide-spanning piece of legislation that aims to regulate content on large online platforms, including X \u2014 states that platforms are responsible for assessing and mitigating risks to, among other things, civic discourse and electoral proceedings.\nEuropean Commission spokesperson Thomas Regnier said in emailed comments that this included \"the obligation to analyse and mitigate risks deriving from any preferential treatment or visibility given to content on a given platform, including Mr Musk's content on his own platform.\"\nHe added that the Commission will hold a roundtable on Jan. 24 to discuss risks ahead of the German election and will be joined by the German Digital Services Coordination and very large online platforms, including X.\nWhile there are currently only a few reports of X's algorithm pushing content from the AfD, there are many accounts of Musk's own posts being preferred, Simone Ruf, deputy head of the Center for User Rights at the Gesellschaft f\u00fcr Freiheitsrechte, a German advocacy organization for basic and human rights, told CNBC by email.\n\"If he uses this treatment to support the AfD via political statements and livestreams showcasing their candidate, this could easily violate the DSA,\" she said.\nRuf also pointed out that as the European Commission is already seeking information from X over cuts to its content moderation resources, it is able to order interim measures to prevent damage for users. \"This could potentially include disabling the recommendation algorithm of X until the federal election,\" she suggested.\nIt is, however, unclear if requests for such measures would succeed, and how they could play out in practice.\nGerman civil society initiative LobbyControl meanwhile argues that the interview could even be seen as an illegal party donation. The group notes that Musk has clearly stated that his goal is to boost the AfD and is using the resources of his platform toward that, with the interview likely being played out more widely that content from regular users of X.\n\"Therefore we can indeed speak of political advertising in this case, because the Platform X usually sells this kind of reach for a lot of money,\" the group said in a statement, according to a CNBC translation. Electoral promotion through third parties is legally seen as a donation, and donations from countries outside of the EU are forbidden, LobbyControl flagged.\nThis is not the first time Musk has endorsed right-wing parties and figures in Europe. Until recently, he supported Nigel Farage, leader of the right-wing Reform party in the U.K. He also launched a tirade against the current U.K. government, led by Labour's Keir Starmer, asking whether \"America should \u2018liberate the people of Britain.\"\nGot a confidential news tip?

The party's platform calls for rigid asylum laws, mass deportations, cuts to social and welfare support in Germany, and the reversal of restrictions on combustion engine vehicles.\nThierry Breton, former European Union commissioner for the internal market, said in a Jan. 4 post on X directed at Weidel: \"As a European citizen concerned with the proper use of systemic platforms authorized to operate in the EU ... especially to protect our democratic rules against illegal or misbehavior during election times, I believe it's crucial to remind you\" that a live discussion on X would give AfD and Weidel \"a significant and valuable advantage over your competitors.\"\nWhile AfD has amassed about 20% of public support, according to reporting from German broadcaster DW, the party is unlikely to form part of a coalition government, as most other parties have vowed not to work with it.\nAfD previously protested the build-out of Tesla's electric vehicle factory outside Berlin, in part because the factory would provide jobs to people who were not German citizens.\nMusk's earlier endorsements of AfD, including tweets complimenting the party and an editorial in a German newspaper, have enraged European government officials. Musk, the wealthiest person in the world, has also endorsed far-right and anti-establishment candidates and causes in the U.K.\nPolitical leaders including in France, Germany, Norway, Spain and the U.K. denounced his influence, NBC News previously reported, warning that Musk should not involve himself in their countries' elections.\nMusk, who was one of President-elect Donald Trump's top backers in November's election, previously promoted Trump in a live-streamed discussion on X. Before that, he hosted a conversation with Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, who lost to Trump in the Republican primary.\nDuring Thursday's conversation, Weidel asked Musk about what Trump might do to bring Russia's war in Ukraine to a conclusion, as the president-elect has suggested he could quickly do.\n\"To be clear this is up to President Trump, he is commander and chief, so it's really up to him,\" Musk said. \"I don't want to speak for him but you know I do think that there is a path to a resolution but it does require\u00a0 strong leadership in the United States to get this done.\"\nMusk also weighed in on what he thought should be done in Gaza, which has been under attack from Israel since Hamas' deadly incursion into Israel on Oct. 7, 2023.\n\"There's no choice but to eliminate those who wish to eliminate the state of Israel, you know Hamas essentially,\" Musk said. \"Then, the second step is to fix the education so that Palestinians are not trained from when they are children to hate and want the death of Israel.\"\n\"Then, the third thing, which is also very important, is to make the Palestinian areas prosperous.\"\nDuring the wide-ranging discussion, which was riddled with disinformation, Musk asked Weidel to address German voters' concern that her party is far right.\nAs Frontline previously reported, some AfD leaders followers of the party have sought to downplay or deny the horrors of Nazi Germany. The party still campaigns on anti-immigrant sentiment, and promotes ethno-nationalist views.\nIn Weidel's response to Musk's question about how the AfD is viewed by others, she characterized Adolf Hitler as a \"communist,\" who was the \"opposite\" of right wing, libertarian or conservative. Musk agreed.\n\u2014 CNBC's Sophie Kiderlin contributed to this report.\nWATCH: Musk's EU interference is not going to help Trump\nGot a confidential news tip?

Some European leaders are concerned that any action against Musk could spark tension with the new U.S. administration.\nFelix Carte, a senior analyst at the Mercator Foundation, said European leaders are being asked to decide whether they are willing to clash with the Trump administration to protect transparency and democracy in Europe.\nLegal and regulatory issues\nThe Commission is considering whether Musk\u2019s actions violate the platform\u2019s obligation to mitigate risks to the democratic process as defined in the DSA. Allegations that the platform is artificially boosting the popularity of AfD-related content may form the basis for legal intervention.\nFormer digital policy commissioner Thierry Breton reminded Musk that support for specific political parties or individuals may violate European social media laws. Although Breton has left the European Commission, he remains strongly critical of Musk.\nNext steps\nThe European Commission faces the difficult task of enforcing European law while managing the political fallout.

You are perfectly right!\u201d Weidel\u00a0posted\u00a0on X in reponse to Musk\u2019s endorsement.\nAside from a generous dollop of far-right bonhomie, here\u2019s a quick rundown of what else to expect when the pair virtually sit down together on X.\n1. A lack of structure\nThe live, audio-only discussion is taking place on Thursday at 7 p.m. CET and 1 p.m. EST on the streaming feature of Musk\u2019s platform X, called Spaces. If Musk\u2019s previous livestream discussion with then-candidate Donald Trump back in August proves to be any guide, the conversation will be largely unstructured and rambling, and possibly glitchy.\nThe chat is scheduled to last up to an hour and is intended to be largely off the cuff, a spokesperson for Weidel told Politico\u2019s Berlin Playbook, as this is in line with \u201cMusk\u2019s nature.\u201d\n2. The far-right echo chamber in action\nAt risk of stating the obvious, don\u2019t expect a balanced and deeply nuanced discussion of the state of German politics.\nIn an opinion essay he wrote for German newspaper Welt am Sonntag, Musk argued that his \u201csignificant investments\u201d in Germany \u2014\u00a0there\u2019s a Tesla gigafactory outside Berlin \u2014 give him the right to opine about Europe\u2019s largest economy.\nBut it seems that Musk gets much of his information about Germany from X, which critics say increasingly resembles a far-right echo chamber. Musk, for instance, has reposted videos of Naomi Seibt, a right-wing influencer known for her closeness to the AfD and denial of climate change caused by humans, who German media have dubbed the \u201canti-Greta,\u201d in reference to Swedish climate activist Greta Thunberg. (In one video reposted by Musk, she described the German Greens\u2019 environmental policies as \u201ceco-socialist national suicide.\u201d)\nIn the past, Musk has seemed to struggle to try to understand German politics.\n\u201cWhy is there such a negative reaction from some about AfD?\u201d Musk\u00a0wrote\u00a0on his X platform in June. \u201cThey keep saying \u2018far right,\u2019 but the policies of AfD that I\u2019ve read about don\u2019t sound extremist. Maybe I\u2019m missing something.\u201d\nWhile Musk has since embraced the AfD, Germany\u2019s federal domestic intelligence agency continues to surveil the party, classifying it as a suspected extremist organization.\n3. Weidel\u2019s true colors?\nAlthough Weidel positions herself as a relative moderate in comparison to other AfD leaders, it possible she could get a little more radical in the friendly company of Musk.\nIn an interview with a U.S. outlet The American Conservative published this week, Weidel referred to Germans as a \u201cdefeated people\u201d and suggested they were \u201cslaves\u201d to the U.S.\nAnyone familiar with German radical-right ideology will recognize at least a hint of victim-perpetrator reversal there that posits the Germans as victims of history. Given that Musk is the AfD\u2019s new American friend, we wonder if the subject will come up.\n4. Whether there\u2019s an impact on the polls\nReputable pollsters in Germany say Musk\u2019s endorsement may not end up making much of a difference in Germany\u2019s Feb. 23 early election.\n\u201cIn the first survey we conducted this year, we found that this has not yet benefited the AfD,\u201d Manfred G\u00fcllner, the head of the Forsa Institute, said. \u201cI don\u2019t see very much potential for future change because Musk has become a negative figure.\u201d\nMusk\u2019s endorsement, however, does have the potential to help legitimize a party that German mainstream politicians have endeavored to depict as an utterly taboo choice.\nAll that we can say for certain is that the AfD is doing well, currently polling in second place at 20 percent, having risen a few percentage points in recent months.\n5. Legal trouble\nThe talk between Musk and Weidel is unlikely to be the end of this new transatlantic lovefest. But there may be lingering legal consequences.\nThe European Commission earlier this week\u00a0said\u00a0that Musk could land in legal trouble under the terms of the EU\u2019s new digital rulebook over the livestream, depending on the extent to which it is deemed to boost the AfD unfairly over rivals.\nMoreover, under German law, the event could potentially be deemed an illegal donation in the form of \u201celection advertising by third parties,\u201d transparency watchdog LobbyControl said in a statement, which could result in a hefty fine for the AfD.\nPauline von Pezold contributed reporting.\nGermany\u2019s likely next chancellor wants tougher migration measures even with far-right support, triggering a backlash ahead of a national election.\n\u201cAcknowledgement of the dark past of the country\u201d is vital, says the chair of Israel\u2019s Holocaust remembrance center.\nThe proposals are to be discussed during next week\u2019s meeting of EU foreign ministers.\nChancellor Olaf Scholz\u2019s latest demand is likely to stall a \u20ac3 billion aid package to the war-ravaged country as Russian forces continue their advance.",

It was heavy on oddness and light on policy as the X owner and the AfD co-leader hit it off.\nBERLIN \u2014 With lots of laughter, earnest agreement and effusive mutual appreciation, it started off like a promising date between two nervous teenagers (she even forgave him for getting her name wrong).\nBut by the end of the night, Elon Musk\u2019s live conversation with far-right German politician Alice Weidel had veered off the rails \u2014 and indeed off the planet entirely \u2014 into a rambling dialogue about Hitler, the existence of God, and why \u201cfuture Martians\u201d will one day save the Earth.\nMusk\u2019s decision last month to endorse Weidel\u2019s Alternative for Germany (AfD) party earned him a storm of criticism from European politicians. But he shrugged it off \u2014 despite the threat of a regulatory investigation \u2014 and offered up his X social media platform, formerly known as Twitter, so she could speak to voters ahead of Germany\u2019s Feb. 23 election.\nWeidel is standing to succeed Olaf Scholz as German chancellor, and while that seems a long way off, her party is attracting significant support and is currently in second place on about 20 percent in the polls.\nIn the meandering  \u2014 sometimes surreal \u2014 85-minute chat, Donald Trump\u2019s favorite entrepreneur, who is the boss of Tesla, a space travel enthusiast and the world\u2019s richest man, restated his heartfelt support for Weidel, claiming her party was the best hope for saving Germany.\nThen it went weird. Here is a summary of the oddest parts of the conversation between the X owner and the co-chair of the AfD:\n\u201cWelcome to the conversation with Alice Weidel, who is currently the leading candidate to run Germany, I think,\u201d Musk declared as the X conversation opened. Unfortunately, he pronounced her name incorrectly as \u201cVeedle.\u201d\nMusk decided to show off his knowledge of German history, including \u201cHitler and whatnot.\u201d He asked Weidel to address media portrayals of the AfD as \u201csomehow associated with Nazism or something like that.\u201d\n\u201cHmm, hmm,\u201d she replied. \u201cThank you for that question.\u201d\n\u201cHe was a communist and he considered himself as a socialist.\u201d She went on: \u201cThe biggest success after that terrible era in our history was to label Adolf Hitler as right and conservative. He was exactly the opposite. He wasn't a conservative. He wasn't a libertarian. He was a communist socialist guy. Full stop. No more comment on that. And we are exactly the opposite.\u201d\nWeidel made the rather odd argument that Hitler \u201cwould never have been successful\u201d if he had not first \u201cswitched off free speech.\u201d His party won the most seats in the German election of 1933. After that he got to work on what Musk, a free-speech fundamentalist, called \u201cextreme censorship.\u201d\nWeidel cited POLITICO\u2019s story revealing how 150 EU officials will be monitoring their conversation to see if Musk was breaking the bloc\u2019s digital rules by giving her party an advantage. Musk clearly isn\u2019t worried.\n\u201cThe American people are demanding change,\u201d he said. \u201cMy recommendation to the people in Germany is to do the same \u2026 I am really strongly recommending that people vote for the AfD.\u201d\nIn case those Brussels officials hadn\u2019t quite got the point, he added: \u201cI think Alice Weidel is a very reasonable person. And hopefully people can tell just from this conversation, like nothing outrageous is being proposed, just common sense. So, in fact, as I said publicly, I think only AfD can save Germany.\u201d\nWeidel took her chance to ask the SpaceX mastermind why he was focusing so much money and attention on developing plans to travel to Mars. Several light years later, he arrived at an answer, of sorts: Because the dinosaurs \u201cdidn\u2019t have spaceships\u201d.\n\u201cA lot of people think there must be aliens but I have not seen any evidence of aliens,\u201d Musk explained. There\u2019s a big chance of a humanity-ending event occurring \u2014\u00a0like \u201ca giant meteor\u201d crashing into Earth like the one that did for the dinosaurs, or a nuclear war. \u201cThere is some risk.\u201d\n\u201cTo be clear, if we are a single planet species, it is just a matter of time before we are annihilated.\u201d\nThis is the kind of downbeat comment that can be a real mood-killer on a date. Weidel listened on in silence. Quickly, though, Musk tried to make amends with some more long-term positivity.\n\u201cI think we can send uncrewed starships to Mars in approximately two years.\u201d\nThere will be a lot of work ahead, though, if we are going to save the human race, Musk said. He estimated it would take about 1 million tons of material and 1 million people to make life self-sustaining on the red planet. But once that little hurdle is overcome, humanity will be laughing \u2014 almost as much as Weidel and Musk were.\n\u201cMy guess is that there will be cases where the future Martians actually come and help and rescue us when there is an emergency, just as America has helped to rescue the rest of world in World War 1 and 2 and the Cold War,\" he said.\n\u201cAs for humanity, we don't want to be one of those lame, one-planet-civilizations. Any self-respecting civilization should have at least two planets.\u201d\nWeidel followed the spaced-out riffing on the end of humanity with a classic deep-and-meaningful, end-of-the-night question. \u201cDo you believe in God?\u201d she asked.\n\u201cI'm open to believing in things that are proportionate to the information that I receive,\u201d he replied, indicating he was \u201copen to the idea\u201d of God. \u201cI try to form my opinions based on what I learn. And as I learn more, I aspire to change my views.\u201d\nAgain, it wasn\u2019t perhaps the profound poetry that Weidel\u2019s question deserved. But she didn\u2019t mind. \u201cYes, same here,\u201d she said. \u201cTo be honest, I\u2019m still on a search.\u201d\nMusk had more to say on the existentialist theme. \u201cI'm curious about the nature of the universe. I would say I subscribe to the Douglas Adams School of Philosophy that was described in 'The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy.' In that book, the Earth was sort of a giant computer that was trying to answer the question, 'what is the meaning of life?' And that goes back with 42 and what does 42 mean?\n\u201cAnd actually the answer is the easy part, and the question is the hard part. That was actually quite an illuminating thing for me, because I had sort of an existential crisis when I was 12 or 13 about the meaning of life. I read the religious texts and the bookstore philosophy. I was reading Schopenhauer,\u201d he said, \u201cwhich is a bit depressing if you're to read it as a child.\u201d\nIt wasn\u2019t all froth and frivolity. Musk and Weidel also discussed the conflict in the Middle East and how the Ukraine war could escalate into nuclear Armageddon. \u201cI want to have strong leaders in Germany,\u201d she said. \u201cThis is also my hope in Donald Trump and in your administration that you end that terrible war [in Ukraine], this worthless dying of young people every day, as fast as you can, because the Europeans, they cannot.\u201d\nMusk reassured her: \u201cI think President Trump is going to solve that conflict very quickly. As you point out, it's now been in somewhat of a stalemate for a few years. And all that's happened over the past few years is hundreds of thousands of people dying, but for no gains. And the longer this conflict goes on, the more Ukraine weakens relative to Russia. Ukraine is a much smaller country. It simply cannot afford the losses relative to Russia ...\u00a0 the longer this drags on, the worse it is for Ukraine.\"\nUK prime minister \u2014 on trip to Kyiv \u2014 says his country will \u2018play our part\u2019 in supporting peace when it comes.\nBritish leader\u2019s trip comes at a key moment, with peace talks on the horizon as Donald Trump returns to power and threatens to shake up the dynamics of war.\nTech billionaire backs Alice Weidel as \u201cleading candidate\u201d to run Germany \u2014 but gets her name wrong.\nVoters on NATO\u2019s eastern flank were already ripe for Moscow\u2019s manipulation, after decades\u00a0of\u00a0misrule.",

President Joe Biden, who was the first senator to endorse Carter\u2019s bid for the White House in 1976, described the 100-year-old Democrat as a man and politician who \u201cembodied the most fundamental human values.\u201dBut few eulogies for the one-term Georgian have underscored his firm moral positions on U.S. foreign policy, which effusively torched both parties for transforming the United States into what he once described as \u201cthe most warlike country on earth.\u201dHere are some of his most powerful quotes:1. \u201cA superpower not only should be the top country as far as military power is concerned, which we\u2019re going to continue to be, but I think that the American superpower goal should be to be the champion of peace, and to be the champion of human rights, and to be the champion of the environment, and to be the most generous nation on earth,\u201d Jimmy Carter said in 2015, later highlighting that the U.S. had been at peace for just 16 of the 242 years that it had existed as a nation.2. \u201cThere was no reason for us to become involved in Iraq recently,\u201d Carter told The Independent in 2004, long before most of the political class dared criticize the U.S. invasion. \u201cThat was a war based on lies and misinterpretations from London and from Washington.\u201d3. \u201cWe cannot be peacemakers if American government leaders are seen as knee-jerk supporters of every action or policy of whatever Israeli government happens to be in power at the moment. That is the essential fact that must be faced.\u201d Carter wrote those words in Palestine: Peace Not Apartheid, criticizing Israel for failing to end its occupation of Palestine, its apartheid system, and its pursuit of punishment of Palestinians. Facing intense backlash from right-wing Israel pressure groups, Carter doubled down, arguing that balanced debate on the two nations was \u201cpractically non-existent\u201d in Congress and the executive branch, and accused American leaders of being in Israel\u2019s pocket.Share This StoryTNR Obituary:Jimmy Carter Was a Politician I Could Believe InMost Recent PostEdith Olmsted/December 30, 2024/8:09 p.m. ETShare This StoryRepublicans Ready to Defy Trump After Mike Johnson EndorsementMike Johnson\u2019s future as House speaker is in jeopardy, even with a Trump endorsement.Kent Nishimura/Getty ImagesDespite direct orders from President-elect Donald Trump, some House Republicans appear to be teeing up to oust House Speaker Mike Johnson. Trump voiced his support for Johnson Monday, just two weeks after the speaker went toe-to-toe with several House Republicans outraged that he had offered a lengthy bipartisan bill to fund the government. And despite Trump\u2019s endorsement, not every Republican is following his lead.Representative Andy Biggs was the latest to signal a reticence to follow the president-elect\u2019s marching orders. During an interview on Fox News Monday, the Arizona Republican said that he wasn\u2019t in the bag for Johnson, yet. \u201cI haven\u2019t publicly or privately committed yet,\u201d said Biggs. \u201cI do want to speak with the speaker just to see what his plans are, because there are some issues that I think need to be worked out, specifically dealing with the budget issues.\u201d Representative Thomas Massie doubled down on his opposition to Johnson in a post on X Monday, reckoning back to another unpopular House speaker Trump once championed. \u201cI respect and support President Trump, but his endorsement of Mike Johnson is going to work out about as well as his endorsement of Speaker Paul Ryan,\u201d Massie wrote. \u201cWe\u2019ve seen Johnson partner with the democrats to send money to Ukraine, authorize spying on Americans, and blow the budget.\u201dBeneath his statement undermining Trump\u2019s judgment, billionaire technocrat Elon Musk replied, \u201cYou might be right, but let\u2019s see how it goes.\u201dMassie wasn\u2019t the only one to bring up Ryan. Representative Victoria Spartz demanded Monday that Johnson outline how he would follow Trump\u2019s agenda to the letter before she could deign to support him for speaker. \u201cI understand why President Trump is endorsing Speaker Johnson as he did Speaker Ryan, which is definitely important. However, we still need to get assurances that @SpeakerJohnson won\u2019t sell us out to the swamp,\u201d she wrote in a post on X Monday. Spartz sent Johnson a list of demands, including a request for \u201cunbiased \u2018non-swamp\u2019 professionals\u201d to help her do her job.

We want it gone.\u2026 We want reparations for the tech workers that you stole their lives.\u201d This is another installment in the current schism between the \u201cAmerica First\u201d MAGA faithful and the tech-world MAGA plutocrats who want more high-skilled immigrants. Former presidential candidate and current DOGE co-lead Vivek Ramaswamy started the fire last week by declaring, \u201cA culture that celebrates the prom queen over the math olympiad champ, or the jock over the valedictorian, will not produce the best engineers,\u201d asserting that it was American culture that was leading CEOs to look elsewhere for labor. This talking point was parroted by Elon Musk and other right-wing techies, inviting a MAGA backlash that even included Nikki Haley, the torchbearer of the old GOP establishment who was vanquished by Trump earlier this year. \u201cThere is nothing wrong with American workers or American culture,\u201d Haley wrote. \u201cAll you have to do is look at the border and see how many want what we have. We should be investing and prioritizing in Americans, not foreign workers.\u201dThis anti-H-1B energy has culminated in Bannon\u2019s calls for reparations, something usually invoked for African Americans historically disenfranchised by slavery and racism. \u201cWe\u2019re gonna get H-1B visas out, root and stem, and all the workers you brought in. Just like we\u2019re deporting 15 million here, we want them deported, out,\u201d Bannon said later in his show. \u201cAnd give those jobs to American citizens today \u2026 we demand they get reparations.

In a rambling post on Truth Social Monday, Trump urged the \u201cParty of COMMON SENSE\u201d to support Johnson\u2019s bid to keep the gavel in the new year. \u201cLETS NOT BLOW THIS GREAT OPPORTUNITY WHICH WE HAVE BEEN GIVEN. The American people need IMMEDIATE relief from all of the destructive policies of the last Administration. Speaker Mike Johnson is a good, hard working, religious man. He will do the right thing, and we will continue to WIN. Mike has my Complete & Total Endorsement. MAGA!!!\u201d he wrote. Most of the post\u2019s word count was dedicated to his own \u201cflawless\u201d reelection campaign.In voicing his support for Johnson, Trump has set up yet another loyalty test for House Republicans. Earlier this month, Johnson came under fire after introducing a 1,547-page continuing resolution to keep the government open until March, among a slew of other bipartisan provisions, inviting the outrage of small-government types like technocrat billionaire Elon Musk, and a slate of sycophantic Republicans.Republican Representative Thomas Massie was so distraught that he claimed he would not vote for Johnson in the upcoming House speaker election in January. Johnson then worked with Trump on crafting another spending bill that suspended the debt ceiling, one of the president-elect\u2019s core demands. But this time, 38 House Republicans broke with Trump and voted against the bill. In the end, Trump\u2019s demand that Republicans find a way to raise or abolish the debt ceiling got left on the cutting room floor. Last week, Representative Andy Harris, who chairs the far-right House Freedom Caucus, said that Republicans need to think about whether their current leadership \u201cis what we need\u201d and that he was \u201cundecided\u201d on what House leadership should look like moving forward. More than a few other Republicans have similarly voiced their dissatisfaction with Johnson, as it seems that the GOP\u2019s antiestablishment bent has turned against the party itself.Share This StoryMore in MAGA news:Trump Pisses Off MAGA Fans With Sudden Reversal on Jimmy CarterMost Recent PostEllie Quinlan Houghtaling/December 30, 2024/5:07 p.m. ETShare This StoryElon Musk Dragged for Hypocrisy After Pathetic Plea to X UsersThe world\u2019s richest man has a new ask of users on his quickly plummeting social media site.Anna Moneymaker/Getty ImagesElon Musk is asking you to make X a more upbeat place.The tech billionaire pleaded with his 209 million X followers on Sunday, placing the onus of change for his dwindling social media investment on site users rather than himself. \u201cPlease post a bit more positive, beautiful or informative content on this platform,\u201d Musk posted.X accounts were quick to throw the ball back into Musk\u2019s court, urging him to create an algorithm where positive content could actually proliferate.\u201cYou first,\u201d snapped back lawyer and bluegrass banjo player Steve Martin.\u201cGetting tired of the toxic wasteland you created?\u201d replied author Karen Piper.Musk likely began to notice his site\u2019s more toxic elements after he became enmeshed in a far-right feud over H-1B work visas last week. Last week, Musk vowed to \u201cgo to war on this issue,\u201d insisting that foreign tech workers need to be allowed to work in the U.S. due to a \u201cpermanent shortage of excellent engineering talent.\u201d That resulted in a backlash that has framed Musk and other H-1B proponents, like unofficial DOGE co-chair Vivek Ramaswamy, as MAGA targets amid Donald Trump\u2019s anti-immigrant agenda. (The H-1B visa program has an annual cap set by Congress, admitting 65,000 foreign workers per year. In 2023, it was estimated that there were more than 700,000 H-1B visa holders in the U.S., according to data from the American Immigration Council.)But surely, if anyone is to blame for the site\u2019s increasingly volatile and disturbing content, it\u2019s none other than Musk himself.In the early days of Musk\u2019s takeover, Twitter witnessed a mass exodus of employees, with Musk claiming he was simply trimming fat by firing upwards of 80 percent of site staff. His \u201cfree speech agenda\u201d has further capped and undermined the site\u2019s content moderation abilities, allowing dangerous rhetoric to flow freely on his platform. His dismantling of the site\u2019s infrastructure has also translated to monumental changes on the website that have proved overwhelmingly unpopular. His tweaked algorithm has aggressively promoted advertisements and reshare accounts, restructured threads to the point that they no longer elevate relevant replies, and has even swapped code to ensure his own posts universally appear at the top of users\u2019 timelines.But despite his plea, even the most unsavory posts haven\u2019t seemed to disturb Musk, who has himself spread Nazi conspiracies via his personal account, and allowed 105 percent more antisemitic hate speech to spread on the platform, according to a 2023 study.Last year, the tech billionaire admitted that the site had lost 90 percent of its value since he acquired it for $44 billion in 2022.

Musk and SpaceX have already been flagged thrice by the Air Force, the Defense Department\u2019s Office of Inspector General, and the undersecretary of defense for intelligence and security for failing to disclose his meetings with foreign leaders, something his current security clearance requires him to do. And his China business isn\u2019t going anywhere either.\u00a0Musk has borrowed at least $1.4 billion from Chinese government\u2013controlled banks\u00a0to pay for his massive Tesla \u201cgigafactory\u201d in Shanghai. He borrowed this money knowing full well that China\u2019s laws allow the Chinese Communist Party to demand information from any company doing business in China in exchange for doing business there\u2014a huge red flag for Honor\u00e9.\u201cMr. Musk\u2019s business dealings in China could require him to hand over sensitive classified information, learned either through his business interests or his proximity to President-elect Donald Trump. No federal agency has accused him of disclosing such material, but as Mr. Ramaswamy put it, China has recognized that U.S. companies are fickle,\u201d Honor\u00e9 wrote. \u201cMr. Musk\u2019s relationship with China\u2019s leaders could prove a problem for America\u2019s national security given that SpaceX has a near monopoly on the United States\u2019 rocket launches \u2026 the last thing the United States needs is for China to potentially have an easier way of obtaining classified intelligence and national security information.\u201dThis has drawn the ire of Democrats and Republicans alike. In 2022, Senator Marco Rubio accused Tesla of obstructing justice for the CCP, and in 2023 he introduced a bill to stop NASA and other federal agencies from giving contracts to companies connected to the\u00a0Chinese Communist Party. Two Democratic senators very recently called for a probe into Musk\u2019s \u201creliability as a government contractor and a clearance holder\u201d because of his reported phone call with Vladimir Putin.\u00a0The line between civilian and elected official has become blurrier as Musk further cements himself as part of Trump\u2019s inner circle.

Approximately $1.25 billion in military aid stems from U.S. stockpiles, with another $1.22 billion coming from the final Ukraine Security Assistance Initiative package from Biden\u2019s term, reported Reuters. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen also said that the U.S. has made available $3.4 billion in additional budget aid to Ukraine amid its ongoing conflict with Russia.\u201cThe Department of Defense is in the process of delivering hundreds of thousands of artillery rounds, thousands of rockets, and hundreds of armored vehicles which will strengthen Ukraine\u2019s hand as it heads into the winter,\u201d Biden said in a statement. \u201cAt my direction, the United States will continue to work relentlessly to strengthen Ukraine\u2019s position in this war over the remainder of my time in office.\u201dThe funds will be used for critical resources and longer-term supplies of air defense, artillery, and other weapons systems, according to Biden.More than 43,000 Ukrainian soldiers have been killed since Russia invaded the Eastern European nation in February 2022. Cities have been leveled, and 370,000 injuries have been reported, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said earlier this month. But Biden\u2019s exit from the White House could mark the end of the U.S. commitment to aiding the war-torn nation.One of Trump\u2019s biggest and boldest campaign promises was that he would immediately end the Russian invasion of Ukraine\u2014though his philosophy on how to achieve that was suspiciously scant of details and, at times, veered toward solutions that would invariably aid Russia.In June, details dished by some of Trump\u2019s advisers suggested that Trump would be open to an increase in U.S. weapons aid to Ukraine so long as it shows up for peace talks with Russia. The advisers envisioned that the peace talks would also quietly include Ukraine ceding part of the country that is currently occupied by Russian forces.And some of Trump\u2019s domestic decisions are reportedly \u201cthrilling\u201d Russian mouthpieces. Margarita Simonyan, the editor in chief of the Russian state-controlled broadcaster RT, claimed earlier this month that some of Trump\u2019s most unqualified choices for his Cabinet\u2014such as DOGE co-chair nominee Vivek Ramaswamy and director of national intelligence nominee Tulsi Gabbard\u2014are friendly faces that bring the Kremlin \u201clots of joy.\u201dMeanwhile, NATO (which Trump has long threatened to withdraw the U.S. from) is preparing for escalations on the Russian front. In early December, NATO chief Mark Rutte warned members that the international alliance must shift to a \u201cwartime mindset,\u201d predicting years of conflict with Russia as the superpower batters down Ukrainian forces.\u201cRussia is preparing for long-term confrontation, with Ukraine and with us,\u201d Rutte said during a speech in Brussels in which he highlighted the short distance to where \u201cRussian bombs are falling \u2026 Iranian drones are flying,\u201d and \u201cNorth Korean soldiers are fighting.\u201d\u201cWe are not ready for what is coming our way in four to five years,\u201d the secretary-general continued. \u201cIt is time to shift to a wartime mindset, and turbocharge our defense production and defense spending.\u201dShare This StoryRemember this?Putin Gives Trump Massive Middle Finger, Days After Warning on UkraineMost Recent PostEdith Olmsted/December 30, 2024/3:23 p.m. ETShare This StoryE.

In a new 77-page filing, the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit affirmed the original verdict from the district court that Trump was liable for sexually abusing Carroll in 1996, then defaming her in 2022. \u201cOn review for abuse of discretion, we conclude that Mr. Trump has not demonstrated that the district court erred in any of the challenged rulings,\u201d the filing stated. \u201cFurther, he has not carried his burden to show that any claimed error or combination of claimed errors affected his substantial rights as required to warrant a new trial.\u201dTrump\u2019s attorneys had argued that the May 2023 verdict should be thrown out because U.S. District Judge Lewis Kaplan should not have allowed jurors to hear testimony from two other women, Jessica Leeds and Natasha Stoynoff, who also accused the president-elect of sexual misconduct. The appeals court, however, ruled that the district court \u201cdid not abuse its discretion\u201d in admitting their testimonies into evidence. Trump\u2019s lawyers also tried to argue that the judge should not have allowed the jury to view the 2005 Access Hollywood tape, in which Trump claimed that \u201cwhen you\u2019re a star\u201d women will let you \u201cgrab them\u201d by their genitals, a video that many people not on the jury have also seen. The court ruled that the inclusion of the tape into evidence was \u201crelevant to prove that the alleged sexual assault actually occurred.\u201d This story has been updated.Share This StoryMore on Trump losing:Trump Pisses Off MAGA Fans With Sudden Reversal on Jimmy CarterMost Recent PostMalcolm Ferguson/December 30, 2024/3:12 p.m. ETShare This StoryAmerica Will Officially Be in Mourning on Trump\u2019s Inauguration DayAmerican flags will still be flying at half-mast on January 20 due to Jimmy Carter\u2019s death on Sunday.NICHOLAS KAMM/AFP/Getty ImagesAmerican flags will be flying at half-mast for Trump\u2019s January 20 inauguration after the death of former President Jimmy Carter on Sunday at age 100. Federal guidelines state that the flag must be \u201chalf-staff for 30 days at all federal buildings, grounds, and naval vessels throughout the United States and its territories and possessions after the death of the president or a former president.\u201dPresident-elect Trump has yet to mention the flags, and offered condolences to the Carter family.\u201cI just heard of the news about the passing of President Jimmy Carter. Those of us who have been fortunate to have served as President understand this is a very exclusive club, and only we can relate to the enormous responsibility of leading the Greatest Nation in History,\u201d Trump wrote in a Truth Social post on Sunday that angered some of the MAGA faithful. \u201cThe challenges Jimmy faced as President came at a pivotal time for our country and he did everything in his power to improve the lives of all Americans. For that, we all owe him a debt of gratitude.\u201dGiven Trump\u2019s general obsession with appearances, such as the crowd size at his first inauguration, he may well feel emasculated by a half-mast American flag at his second one.

They have all quit X, the social\u00a0network previously known as Twitter, since Donald Trump's election victory in November 2024. And they are far from the only ones. On Friday, more than 60 German-language universities announced that they would no longer be using X.\nHelmed by the world's richest Trump supporter, Elon Musk, the network seems to be falling out of favor with users outside of the MAGA political camp, and \u2014 despite the billionaire's 2022 pledge to keep the platform \"politically neutral\" \u2014 many observers believe that he is actively working to turn X into an extremist megaphone.\nTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video\nExperts consulted by DW said there was no way to reliably tell if the system has been updated to boost right-wing posts since the start of the Musk era, as its algorithms are constantly being tweaked and responding to a changing user base. It is clear, however, that many banned accounts were restored under Musk despite previous violations, including hate speech, misinformation and antisemitism. Experts also point out that the overall discourse will keep shifting right as more liberal and left users leave the platform.\n\"The outcome for users is the same regardless of the cause: significantly more far-right content on the platform and in people\u2019s recommended feeds,\" social scientist and digital media researcher Colin Henry told DW.\nMusk also leveraged his status as X's most-followed account to amplify pro-Trump voices and narratives in the run-up to the US election, even referring to himself as Trump's \"first buddy.\"\nHaving now set his sights on politics with the\u00a0European Union, Musk told his more than 211 million followers\u00a0that German Chancellor Olaf Scholz is a \"fool,\" and President Frank-Walter Steinmeier \u2014 a man whose office is mostly ceremonial \u2014 is a \"tyrant.\" Musk also publicly endorsed the nationalist Alternative for Germany (AfD), saying it was the only party that could \"save Germany.\" On Thursday, Musk held a live chat on X with Alice Weidel, the AfD co-leader and candidate for chancellor in Germany's upcoming elections.\nTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video\nMusk's support for Trump and the ongoing meddling in EU politics have prompted outrage in Germany.

This influence is partly due to the media idolizing him as \"a kind of hero\" for many years, Doctorow said.\nHe said Musk could use X to make the case to his more than 211 million followers that \"the AfD are swell fellows and their association with fascism and ethnic cleansing is overstated.\"\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\"All it takes,\" Doctorow said, \"is for a very small number of people to show up for those delicate balances that have been calculated by party consultants to be disrupted.\"\nDoctorow said Musk's rise was a foreseeable outcome of the decadeslong effort to dismantle monopoly laws in North America and Europe, making him \"so rich that he is too big to jail, too big to fail and far too big to care what anybody thinks of him.\"\nAnd, though\u00a0Scholz\u00a0has attempted to avoid engaging with Musk, Doctorow said publicly fighting back against someone \"who has a giant audience\" could in fact be a great political strategy for the German chancellor.\n\"Musk is not very smart,\" Doctorow said. \"He's got lots of followers. A lot of them don't really know much about him: They've just absorbed the legend \u2014 and you can debunk the legend in real time if you are good at it.\"\n\"If you suck at it, though, the last thing you want is to be humiliated in front of 200 million people. ... So I think it really depends on the politician.\"\nOn Wednesday, German Anti-Discrimination Commissioner Ferda Ataman urged the government to leave X, calling the network \"an instrument of political influence by the richest man in the world.\"\n\"X is not a serious platform,\" Ataman said.\nSeveral high-profile organizations and users in Germany have already quit X, including the country's highest criminal court on Thursday.\u00a0Fabian Mehring, the digitalization minister of Germany's richest state, Bavaria, left X over Musk's support for the AfD. \u00a0Former Berlin state secretary Sawsan Chebli walked away from the network alongside federal lawmakers Jamila Sch\u00e4fer und Misbah Khan and dozens of other prominent voices in early December, with the group saying that X has become a \"place of censorship, racism, antisemitism, and rightwing agenda-setting.\"\nA center of documentation of Nazi crimes in Munich and the city's Jewish Museum also\u00a0decided to stop using the platform, along with dozens of other semiofficial and nongovernment bodies, including three Bundesliga football teams.\nResponding to this week's calls to abandon X, German officials have said the government has decided against doing so for now.\n\"We have to be there where people go for information,\" government spokesperson Steffen Hebestreit told reporters. \"But, of course, you always have to ask yourself if the environment for it is still sustainable, and we are asking ourselves this question. So far, we have answered this by saying that the damage of withdrawing from this platform would be greater than the benefits.\"\nHenry, the US social scientist, said politicians who weren't aligned with the far right were rapidly disappearing within X anyway.\n\"Audiences have either left, or, when officials need to communicate real-time information during, say, a natural disaster, they are drowned out by conspiracy theories or hate speech,\" Henry\u00a0said.\nConfronted with reports that Musk is attempting to interfere in the election, Hebestreit said the fact that even multibillionaires have a right to express themselves.\nTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video\n\"At the same time, it is also true that multibillionaires are not smarter or more knowledgeable than others.

She discussed everything from \u201cwoke mind virus\u201d censorship to how stumped she was on the conflict in the Middle East. Her most eyebrow-raising assertion though was that Hitler was a Communist.\u201cHitler was a Communist. He considered himself as a socialist.\u2026 The biggest success of our country was to label Adolf Hitler as a conservative or a libertarian,\u201d Weidel opined. \u201cHe was a Communist socialist guy. Full stop. AfD is the exact opposite. It\u2019s a conservative libertarian party. Hitler was not \u2018on the right.\u2019 Hitler played with people\u2019s envy against each other. That was a socialist weapon. He was nothing other than an antisemitic socialist.\u201dWeidel\u2019s shameless attempt to associate Hitler with her political enemies on the left was met with zero pushback from Musk. In reality, Hitler was actually very specific about not being a socialist, even as his Nazi Party was called the \u201cNationalist Socialist Party\u201d (a popular \u2018gotcha\u2019 among Weidel and her fans). Hitler changed the meaning of socialism to fit his own fascistic narrative.\u201c\u200b\u200bSocialism is the science of dealing with the common weal. Communism is not socialism. Marxism is not socialism. The Marxians have stolen the term and confused its meaning. I shall take socialism away from the socialists,\u201d Hitler said in a 1923 interview. \u201cSocialism is an ancient Aryan, Germanic institution. Our German ancestors held certain lands in common.\u201dHitler was also a staunch anti-Communist.\u201cIn the years 1913 and 1914 I expressed my opinion for the first time in various circles \u2026 that the problem of how the future of the German nation can be secured is the problem of how Marxism can be exterminated,\u201d Hitler wrote in Mein Kampf. He advocated for \u201cthe destruction of Marxism in all its shapes and forms\u201d in those same pages.Those on the left and the right quickly sounded off in opposition to Weidel\u2019s claim.\u201cThe fact that Alice Weidel\u2014co-leader of Germany\u2019s far-right extremists\u2014calls Hitler a \u2018communist\u2019 and likening Nazis to \u2018leftish Palestinian\u2019 antisemites in ONE sentence epitomizes the distorted discourse the liberal center in Germany has normalized over the past 15 months,\u201d wrote Guardian reporter Hanno Hauenstein.\u201cHitler did not govern as a communist, where the state owned all of the means of production. All private companies were NOT nationalized as is claimed below. Hitler governed more like Mussolini (and sadly today\u2019s America) via economic fascism,\u201d wrote libertarian commentator Chris Rossini. \u201cPrivate hands \u2026 but those hands are at the disposal of the state. That\u2019s economic fascism. Not communism \u2026 where there are no private hands \u2026 and only the state.\u201d\u201cAlice Weidel\u2019s claim that Hitler was a \u2018communist socialist\u2019 is completely off. Hitler and the Nazis were far-right, deeply anti-communist, and focused on nationalism, not socialism. They worked closely with big businesses, not against them,\u201d military news outlet Geo Insider posted.Musk gave Weidel a huge, uninhibited platform to spread her right-wing misinformation campaign. The world\u2019s richest man was already accused of election interference in Germany prior to his interview with the AfD leader, and is looking to bolster far-right politics in the U.K. and Italy as well.Share This StoryMost Recent PostEllie Quinlan Houghtaling/January 9, 2025/9:48 p.m. ETShare This StoryMeta\u2019s Dangerous Rule Change Has Unleashed Some Vile New ContentEmployees are reportedly protesting the changes.Drew Angerer/AFP/Getty ImagesMeta employees are protesting the company\u2019s new content moderation guidelines, which practically amount to no content moderation at all.Some of the recent changes have dropped the digital guardrails on controversial topics such as immigration, race, gender identity, as well as language around the LGBTQ+ community, including allowing users to suggest that being gay is a mental illness. That last detail has sent some of the company\u2019s own employees into a rage, according to internal conversations obtained by 404 Media.\u201cI am LGBT and Mentally Ill,\u201d one employee wrote on an internal Meta forum called Workplace reads, 404 Media reported Thursday. \u201cJust to let you know that I\u2019ll be taking time out to look after my mental health.\u201dUsers on Meta\u2019s platforms, including Facebook, Instagram, and Threads, will also be allowed to refer to women as \u201chousehold objects or property or objects in general,\u201d Black people as \u201cfarm equipment,\u201d and transgender individuals as \u201cit,\u201d according to an updated version of Meta\u2019s hateful conduct policy that crossed out the prohibitions.On Tuesday, Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg announced that the social media behemoth would rid itself of its third-party fact-checkers, opting instead to replace them with user-generated corrections \u00e0 la Elon Musk\u2019s \u201ccommunity notes\u201d function on X.\u201cFact-checkers have been too politically biased and have destroyed more trust than they\u2019ve created,\u201d Zuckerberg said in a video announcement posted to Facebook. \u201cWhat started as a movement to be more inclusive has increasingly been used to shut down opinions and shut out people with different ideas, and it\u2019s gone too far.\u201dShare This StoryRead more about Meta:\u201cFree Speech\u201d Haven Facebook Blocking Internal Criticism of Trump AllyMost Recent PostHafiz Rashid/January 9, 2025/9:22 p.m. ETShare This StoryJohn Fetterman Pathetically Brags About Planned Trump Mar-a-Lago VisitFetterman would be the first sitting Democratic senator to visit Donald Trump at his estate\u2014and for some reason, he\u2019s proud of it.Andrew Harnik/Getty ImagesJohn Fetterman will become the first sitting Democratic senator to visit Donald Trump at his Mar-a-Lago estate following the 2024 election, CBS News reports.\u201cThat is the plan.

And no one is my gatekeeper.\u201dWhen Fetterman ran for the Senate in 2022 against Trump\u2019s handpicked candidate Mehmet Oz, Trump shamelessly accused Fetterman of abusing heroin, cocaine, crystal meth, and fentanyl, which Fetterman\u2019s campaign dismissed at the time as \u201cthe same crap from these two desperate and sad dudes.\u201dSince then, Trump has been reelected president, Oz became Trump\u2019s shady pick to run Medicare and Medicaid, and Fetterman became one of the most GOP-friendly Democrats in Congress. He has boasted about shifting away from progressive politics for more than a year, even claiming that brain damage from his near-fatal stroke allowed him to \u201csay the things that I have to really believe in and not be afraid of if there\u2019s any kind of blowback.\u201d Fetterman\u2019s right-wing turn, including his full-throated support for Israel\u2019s brutal war in Gaza, has cost him a lot of Democratic support. Most recently, Fetterman even downplayed Trump\u2019s crazy idea to annex Greenland, comparing it to the Louisiana Purchase, signaling that he may be willing to go against his own party over the next four years like former Senators Kyrsten Sinema and Joe Manchin.An official on Trump\u2019s transition team said that a meeting between the president-elect and senator has not yet been finalized, but it goes to show that Fetterman either isn\u2019t worried about the coming Trump presidency or just doesn\u2019t care.

Pipaluk Lynge, the chair of Greenland\u2019s parliamentary foreign and security policy committee, told Politico that the territory wants its \u201cown independence and democracy.\u201d Lynge also warned the United States not to \u201cinvade\u201d the nation, which is largely composed of Indigenous tribes, in light of its historical treatment of Alaska\u2019s Indigenous population.\u201cGreenland is not for sale and will never be for sale,\u201d Aaja Chemnitz, another member of Greenland\u2019s Parliament, told NBC News.But some of the behind-the-scenes details of the pro-Trump expedition are even worse.Danish media reported Thursday that a series of photos featuring Kirk and Greenlandic residents in MAGA hats was staged. The MAGA cohort reportedly rounded up homeless people from the area\u2014including one person from under a bridge\u2014promising them a meal at the Hotel Hans Egede in exchange for their participation in the pro-Trump photo circuit.Videos of the trip that circulated on X describe the Greenlandic participants as \u201cthe local community in Nuuk,\u201d but several local sources that spoke with DR News described the photographed individuals as \u201chomeless and socially disadvantaged\u201d people who are often outside the supermarket directly across from the hotel where the Trump event was held.\u201cAll they have to do is put on a cap and be in the Trump staff\u2019s videos. They are being bribed, and it is deeply distasteful,\u201d Tom Amtoft, a 28-year resident of Nuuk, told the Danish news outlet.Amtoft reportedly witnessed the group\u2019s attempts to get locals to wear the MAGA caps for the photos, describing the process as \u201cvery aggressive.\u201d He said the Trump envoys chose a \u201cselective\u201d group of people \u201cwho could say that Greenland should be bought.\u201dShare This StoryRead more about the Greenland trip:Trump Sends Idiot Son on Futile MissionMost Recent PostEllie Quinlan Houghtaling/January 9, 2025/7:55 p.m. ETShare This StoryCompare and Contrast: Los Angeles Fire Damage vs. Green New Deal CostDamage from the Los Angeles fires is likely to be the most expensive in national history.Official Flickr Account of CAL FIRE/Handout/Getty ImagesThe Los Angeles wildfires have so far claimed 1,300 structures and threatened 60,000 more, torching a total area larger than Manhattan. Analysts predict that the blaze could be the most expensive in U.S. history, costing billions of dollars in repairs across the city\u2014but it didn\u2019t have to be that way.Total economic losses for the inferno are predicted to reach nearly $50 billion, JPMorgan analyst Jimmy Bhullar told the Wall Street Journal, though they could continue to rise if the fires aren\u2019t brought under control. Bhullar estimated that the price tag on insured losses would be more than $20 billion, nearly $8 billion more than the most destructive wildfire in California\u2019s history, the 2018 Camp Fire in Butte County.Local authorities have acknowledged there is a serious lack of personnel and essential resources, such as water, to effectively combat the fire. But remedies to legitimately tackle the growing climate threat have sat on the table, sinking from inaction, for years.Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders\u2019s Green New Deal proposed an $18 billion increase in national spending specifically to address the \u201cmore frequent and severe wildfires\u201d plaguing the American West.\u201cIn order to be able to quickly and effectively respond to wildfires, we will expand the wildfire restoration and disaster preparedness workforce,\u201d the proposal reads. \u201cWe will increase funding for firefighting by $18 billion for federal firefighters to deal with the increased severity and frequency of wildfires.\u201dSanders first unveiled the details of his radical agenda to fight climate change in 2019, after a cohort of progressive lawmakers in Congress outlined a new series of climate principles and goals for the nation. In March last year, Sanders and New York Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez reintroduced the legislation. They were joined by 55 lawmakers in the House and seven senators, but the proposal was ultimately dismissed by Republicans and Democrats alike for its lofty objectives, with some critics hyperbolically mischaracterizing the policy. Arkansas Senator Tom Cotton falsely told conservative radio host Hugh Hewitt in 2019 that the proposal would confiscate cars and would force Americans to ride a light rail \u201cpowered by unicorn tears.\u201d The same year, Wyoming Senator John Barrasso baselessly claimed that the Green New Deal would ban livestock and mark the end of ice cream, cheeseburgers, and milkshakes.But while Congress has failed to offer alternative solutions, the looming national crisis awaits\u2014with an incoming Republican trifecta apparently set on killing tax credits for electric vehicles and spurring fossil fuel production on federally protected land.Meanwhile, Donald Trump\u2019s transition team has already prepared executive orders for the president-elect to once again withdraw the U.S. from the Paris Agreement, the international climate treaty limiting greenhouse gas emissions. And Trump isn\u2019t likely to offer much help to California while it rebuilds from the blaze, either\u2014the forty-fifth president reportedly resisted sending wildfire aid to the Golden State in 2018 because the state voted Democratic.Share This StoryRead more about the fires:Conservatives Somehow Find a Way to Be Racist About L.A.

Bush and his wife, Laura.Trump shunned Pence in 2020 after the vice president refused to stop the certification of the election results. \u201cYou can either go down in history as a patriot, or you can go down in history as a pussy,\u201d Trump told Pence during the certification process, according to The New York Times. Pence chose to defy his president.\u201cMike Pence didn\u2019t have the courage to do what should have been done to protect our Country and our Constitution,\u201d Trump tweeted during the January 6 riots shortly before shouts of \u201cHang Mike Pence\u201d began ringing out from the crowd. Former White House aide Cassidy Hutchinson later testified that Trump expressed support for the chants that day.It\u2019s likely that this was Trump and Pence\u2019s first public encounter since January 6, 2021.

Foreign Minister Javier Martinez-Acha said Tuesday that \u201cthe sovereignty of our canal is not negotiable and is part of our history of struggle.\u201dTrump claimed last month that Chinese troops were stationed in the canal zone, which Panamanian President Jos\u00e9 Ra\u00fal Mulino called \u201cnonsense,\u201d saying that \u201cthere is not a single Chinese soldier in the canal.\u201d Johnson seems to be playing to Trump\u2019s ego with the bill, if his words to Fox News on Wednesday are any indication.\u201cI think it is a Teddy Roosevelt moment,\u201d the South Dakota representative said. \u201cAnd frankly, America used to run this canal, and it was very well run under American leadership.\u201dIn recent weeks, Trump has also floated taking over Greenland and adding Canada as the fifty-first U.S. state. Whether his plans are serious or not, they\u2019ve already received pushback from leaders in the Danish territory, Canada, and even France, speaking on behalf of the European Union.The case of Panama is unique, though: Trump has an outstanding tax evasion case in the country and could be looking to settle scores (and protect his wallet) with some saber-rattling. Maybe he also has some kind of financial interests in Greenland and Canada. If only the president-elect saw dollar signs in Southern California. Maybe then, people who are losing their homes and livelihoods to wildfires would be his priority.

WildfiresAnything but climate change.Apu Gomes/Getty ImagesThe right is blaming diversity, equity, and inclusion and \u201cwokeness\u201d for the response to massive wildfires in Southern California.Several conservative pundits and personalities have gone after their favorite bogeymen on social media this week as fires have spread throughout the Los Angeles metro area, afflicting liberals, conservatives, the wealthy, and the poor alike.Some bizarrely claimed that the shortage in firefighters was because \u201cLos Angeles deliberately set out to exclude white men from becoming firefighters,\u201d in the words of Matt Walsh.Others blamed DEI and wokeness more broadly.Megyn Kelly went on a tirade on her radio show Wednesday, blaming Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass and Los Angeles Fire Department Chief Kristin Crowley for prioritizing \u201cdiversity,\u201d attacking Crowley\u2019s background. \u201cWho gives a s\u2013t if the fire chief is gay? I\u2019m sorry but who gives a flying fig about who she likes to sleep with; can you fight the f\u2013king fires, madam? That\u2019s the relevant question,\u201d Kelly said.Chaya Raichik, the bigot behind the \u201cLibs of TikTok\u201d account, also went after Crowley. Many on the right cited a 2017 speech by right-wing comedian Adam Carolla, who complained that he was rejected when he applied to be a Los Angeles firefighter because he was \u201cnot Black, Hispanic, or a woman,\u201d as evidence. But Carolla\u2019s story, if true, took place in the 1980s, not recently, a fact lost on these conservatives. And in another bizarre turn, pundit Charlie Kirk railed against sign language interpreters during emergency briefings, calling them a \u201cdistraction\u201d and \u201cover the top.\u201dIn reality, one major reason for the shortfall in firefighters in Los Angeles is because Bass cut the city\u2019s firefighting budget by $17.6 million, while increasing the police department\u2019s by $126 million. But conservatives aren\u2019t going to complain about a higher police budget. Nor are they going to realize that climate change is the root cause of increased wildfires. Maybe they think shooting at a wildfire can put it out.Share This StoryMore on the politicization of the wildfires:Trump\u2019s and Musk\u2019s Disgusting Response to California FiresMost Recent PostMalcolm Ferguson/January 9, 2025/5:20 p.m. ETShare This StoryElon Musk Sets His Sights on Toppling Another World LeaderNot satisfied with what he\u2019s done to America, the world\u2019s richest man is now looking to interfere in a European country.Chris Unger/Zuffa LLCElon has zeroed in on his next political target: U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer.The world\u2019s richest man has been consulting with his right-wing allies to devise a strategy to oust the Labour Party\u2019s Starmer before the next election, according to a report from the Financial Times Thursday.Musk has been antagonizing Starmer on X for some time, but according to people familiar with the matter, he is now focused on finding a way to destabilize the Labour government and bolster other alternatives.\u201cHis view is that Western civilisation itself is threatened,\u201d one source told FT.Musk has been rallying to free far-right, Islamaphobic hooligan Tommy Robinson from prison since the new year and thinks that all-out civil war is \u201cinevitable\u201d in the nation. He\u2019s also been calling for a national investigation into the grooming and exploitation cases in the Midlands region of England. Musk blames Starmer, who was a director of public prosecutions at the time, for his oversight on the issue.Musk\u2019s attempted toppling of Starmer is another installment in his efforts to exert the same political influence he has in the United States in Europe. The billionaire has been singing the praises of Germany\u2019s far-right, nativist Alternative for Germany, or AfD,\u00a0 Party. He published an op-ed in a German newspaper in which he wrote, \u201cPortraying the AfD as far-right is clearly false, considering that Alice Weidel, the party\u2019s leader, has a same-sex partner from Sri Lanka! Does that sound like Hitler to you? Come on!\u201d He has since been accused of election interference by the German government but has shown no signs of stopping. He is also scheduled to host AfD leader Alice Weidel live on X sometime before the German elections in February.Meanwhile, Musk is also closing in on a massive telecommunications deal with Italy\u2019s far-right government, entrenching himself in the Eurozone.

He has vehemently denied any wrongdoing.Merchan has already said he does not intend to sentence Trump to prison. If he is fined, which also seems unlikely, his attorneys are expected to argue that this process is an undue burden on Trump as he prepares to take office again.Trump has been begging the Supreme Court to help him evade sentencing for weeks now, even trying to incur his presidential immunity\u2014but to no avail thus far. \u201cI never falsified business records.

Weidel's assertions are seen as part of a broader trend of historical revisionism among nationalists.

            "content": "In a live talk with X owner Elon Musk, Alternative for Germany chancellor candidate Alice Weidel claimed that Nazi leader Adolf Hitler was not \"right-wing,\" but a communist instead. Historians vehemently disagree.\nDuring Thursday's live discussion between Elon Musk\u00a0and Alice Weidel,\u00a0the chancellor candidate for the nationalist Alternative for Germany (AfD) party in February's election, on the\u00a0X (formerly Twitter)platform, both participants made many hard-to-verify claims, several of which\u00a0DW's fact checkers have already\u00a0looked into.\nBut one claim in particular, about the National Socialist German Workers Party (NSDAP), or Nazis,\u00a0and World War II, was particularly off: Weidel said Adolf Hitler was not \"right-wing,\"\u00a0but a \"communist.\" This historical revisionism, an attempt to retell the history of\u00a0National Socialism, is not new. As nationalists rise in international politics, it is frequently being repeated.\nClaim: \"[The National Socialists] nationalized the entire industry. ... The biggest success after that terrible era in our history was to label Adolf Hitler as right and conservative. He was exactly the opposite. He wasn't a conservative. ...\u00a0He was a communist, socialist guy,\"\u00a0Weidel told Musk. In a follow-up interview with the German broadcaster ntv, she repeatedly emphasized: \"I don't deviate from this either:\u00a0Adolf Hitler\u00a0was a leftist.\"\nDW Fact check: False\nThis claim is false and trivializes the atrocities committed under Hitler and the Nazis from 1933 through 1945. The AfD, which in Germany is often classified as far right to extreme right, has repeatedly tried to distance itself from Nazism. Right-wing politicians in the United States, including Vice President-elect JD Vance, have also spread false statements about Germany's Nazi history (read DW's fact check on these claims here).\u00a0Many people online seem to believe\u00a0the AfD leader's assertion nonetheless.\n\"What Ms. Weidel is saying is sheer nonsense, which I don't want to promote by taking it seriously,\"\u00a0German historian Thomas Sandk\u00fchler told DW via email.\nMichael Wildt, a prominent historian of the Third Reich, also told DW that Weidel's claim was \"huge nonsense.\"\n\"Hitler fought Marxism fiercely and brutally right from the start,\" Wildt said, \"and the first victims to be imprisoned, tortured and killed in the concentration camps in 1933 were leftists, communists, Social Democrats and socialists.\"\nHitler's policies directly contradicted the goals of communism. \"From an economic point of view in particular, Hitler was not a communist,\"\u00a0Thomas Weber, historian and author of the book Becoming Hitler: The Making of a Nazi,\u00a0told DW. \"Economically,\u00a0communism aims to overcome private property, to overcome a profit-oriented economy and to transfer the most important means of production (like\u00a0mines and factories) and natural resources into common property,\"\u00a0Weber said. Hitler rejected these aims.\nHitler also can't be described as a communist \"because he was an antisemite and a racist,\" Wildt said. \"And that has nothing to do with the idea of a communist society in which people are equal \u2014 rather, it is exactly the opposite.\"\nThe political movement of National Socialism was not in fact socialism. And it did not just emerge during Hitler's time, but had already emerged after World War I, becoming increasingly entrenched toward\u00a0World War II. \"National Socialism was extremely nationalist, anti-democratic, anti-pluralist, antisemitic, racist, imperialist and anti-communist,\"\u00a0according to the Brandenburg Center for Political Education website, which adds that the racist exclusion of minorities up to and including genocide played a central role in the ideology.\nNational Socialism benefited from some of the ideas of socialism, using them to win working-class votes en route to taking power in 1933. However, the Nazi labor and social legislation that followed led to the suppression, persecution and murder of communists, Social Democrats and trade unionists.\n\"The essential point here is that, from Hitler's and many National Socialists' point of view, the \u2018socialism' in the party name was not an empty formula or a trick,\" Weber said. \"Rather, it defined how Hitler saw himself and how he wanted to rebuild the world. He repeatedly emphasized this in private and in public.\"\nIn the early days of the NSDAP, there was a self-proclaimed socialist wing, but this was eliminated before the party came to power in 1933. Hitler had Gregor Strasser, a leading figure in this wing, killed in June 1934, along with other opponents within the party. Though the so-called Strasser wing sought a national socialism in favor of the German working class, it was just as racist and antisemitic as the rest of the NSDAP.\nFor these reasons, most historians have long agreed that National Socialism cannot be equated with socialism. But there are politicians who still attempt to do so for political reasons, Weber said.\n\"This question is usually discussed too narrowly \u2014 along the lines of: was Hitler left-wing or right-wing?\" Weber said.\u00a0\"And then either the right-wing side tries to portray Hitler as a classic socialist and leftist, which makes no sense, or there is an attempt to reduce the use of the term 'socialism' by Hitler and the National Socialists to an election campaign ploy. That doesn't make sense either, because it ignores how Hitler and the National Socialists defined themselves, how they saw the world, and how they tried to change the world.\"\nThis article was originally written in German.\nTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video",

Tesla, owned by Musk, operates its own system of charging stations in Germany.\n\"It is no secret that Tesla was against the government funding for electric charging stations in Germany,\" the chancellor said, suggesting Musk's comments stem from business dissatisfaction.\nTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video\nGerman Vice Chancellor Robert Habeck\u00a0had sharper words for Musk.\n\"Hands off our democracy, Mr. Musk!\" Habeck told German news magazine Der\u00a0Spiegel\u00a0when asked whether Musk was a threat to Germany. He criticized Musk's outspoken support for the far-right AfD.\nHabeck said the billionaire, who is expected to have a prominent role in the upcoming US government, is doing whatever he can to push his own interests.\n\"The combination of immense wealth, control over information and networks, the use of artificial intelligence and the will to ignore rules is a frontal attack on our democracy,\"\u00a0said Habeck.\nHe further described Musk's recent article endorsing the AfD\u00a0as \"awful,\" and warned that his attempts to influence German politics\u00a0must not be underestimated.\n\"The richest man in the world, who owns one of the most powerful communication platforms, openly supports a party that is partly right-wing extremist.

However, he also addressed a more contentious issue: Alleged \u201cforeign interference\u201d in German politics, particularly by Musk, who has openly supported the right-wing Alternative for Germany (AfD) party as the country\u2019s \u201clast spark of hope.\u201d\n\u201cWhere Germany goes from here will be decided by you \u2013 the citizens.

But it won\u2019t be the person who yells the loudest who will decide where Germany goes from here. Rather, that will be up to the vast majority of reasonable and decent people,\u201d he added.\nWe are a country that stands together. Also when times are tough, as we know they are. Many are wondering where we go from here. My answer: With mutual respect, trust, interest and engagement, we can make 2025 a good year. #Newyearsaddresspic.twitter.com/pybHh2PAaU\nMusk\u2019s recent endorsements of the AfD, which is under surveillance by domestic intelligence for its alleged \u201cextremist\u201d views, has drawn widespread criticism from German officials. The billionaire, a key adviser to US President-elect Donald Trump, has been vocal on social media and in opinion pieces, praising the AfD and criticizing mainstream German politicians.\nFriedrich Merz, the head of the conservative Christian Democratic Union (CDU), called Musk\u2019s endorsement \u201coverbearing and presumptuous.\u201d Lars Klingbeil, co-chairman of Scholz\u2019s Social Democrats, compared Musk to Russian President Vladimir Putin, claiming that both aim to weaken Germany and plunge it into chaos.\nA government spokeswoman, Christiane Hoffmann,\u00a0said at a news conference on Monday that while everyone has the right to an opinion, Musk is attempting to influence the German election.\nScholz\u2019s coalition government collapsed in November over disagreements regarding Ukraine aid and economic policies. The chancellor lost a confidence vote in December, leading to the dissolution of parliament and the scheduling of snap elections on February 23.\nThe chancellor's New Year\u2019s Eve address also touched on other pressing issues, including Germany\u2019s flagging economy, the recent attack on a Christmas market in Magdeburg, and the upcoming 35th anniversary of German reunification. Scholz urged Germans to resist manipulation and \u201cnot let ourselves be played off each other.\u201d\nAccording to Statista, 56% of Germans believe Scholz has done a poor job, while 37% are satisfied with his performance. This rating reflects concerns over Germany\u2019s economic stagnation, his migration policies, and a general perception of ineffective governance.\nThe AfD is currently polling second with around 20%, behind the CDU/CSU bloc at about 31%. However, a strong performance by the AfD could make forming a government more challenging, as all mainstream parties have ruled out a coalition with it.\nRT News App\n\u00a9 Autonomous Nonprofit Organization \u201cTV-Novosti\u201d, 2005\u20132025.

His diagnoses of Germany\u2019s problems came with a suggested solution, voting for the right-sovereigntist AfD.\nThe legacy media and prevailing political opinion in mainstream Germany considers the AfD extreme if not outright dangerous. Moves to ban the party are attempted and elements of the force have been investigated by Germany\u2019s political police. Yet Musk in his interjection called on German voters to judge the party on its policies.\nHe wrote, further: \u201che AfD, even though it is described as far-right, represents a political realism that resonates with many Germans who feel their concerns are ignored by the establishment\u2026\u00a0Portraying the AfD as far-right is clearly false, considering that Alice Weidel, the party\u2019s leader, has a same-sex partner from Sri Lanka! Does that sound like Hitler to you? Come on!\u201d.\nMusk has a major Tesla factory in Germany and his points often veered towards those that intersect with those interests, like the German economy and energy policy. Yet he also spoke of border control, a hot-button topic in Germany and the area where the AfD is most strongly differentiated from other parties. He wrote that immigration policy is\u00a0\u201cnot about xenophobia, but about ensuring that Germany does not lose its identity in the pursuit of globalization. A nation must preserve its core values \u200b\u200band cultural heritage in order to remain strong and united.\u201d\nThe Musk op-ed was published in tandem with a rebuttal by\u00a0incoming Welt editor in chief\u00a0Jan Philipp Burgard, who takes up his role on january 1st, and who stated his view that while Musk has impressive powers of perception and is right in his diagnoses of Germany\u2019s problems, he nevertheless errs in his solution, calling support for the AfD \u201cfatally wrong\u201d.\nBurgard went on to criticise the AfD for wanting to challenge the status quo and for having views outside of the Berlin mainstream.\u00a0Mainstream parties who created all the problems Germany presently experiences can definitely be trusted to fix them, the newspaper boss insists, intoning of Musk\u2019s interjection: \u201cEven a genius can be wrong.\u201d\nThere were other, even stronger responses from the staff at\u00a0Die Welt to the paper carrying Musk\u2019s piece. Indeed, the publication\u2019s opinions editor\u00a0Eva Marie Kogel went straight to X/Twitter to announce she was resigning over the matter.\nIf Musk\u2019s comments have any impact on German politics, it could be an existential matter for the legacy parties which have spent years carefully building a\u00a0cordon sanitaire around the nascent AfD, working to keep it locked out of power. Similar efforts have been enacted in many other European countries, with varying degrees of success.\nThe intervention follows similar involvement in British politics in recent weeks, with Musk offering at least tacit support to Nigel Farage\u2019s Reform UK, which is soaring in the polls. This has been met with howls of derision in Britain, and clearly much the same is being felt in Berlin. The likely next Chancellor of Germany\u00a0Friedrich Merz of the centre-right CDU called it \u201cintrusive and arrogant\u201d.\nGermany is presently heading to a snap general election after its outgoing \u2018progressive coalition\u2019 collapsed in November, on the day President Trump\u2019s second term was proclaimed to the world. Per remarks from Chancellor Olaf Scholz at the time, these events were not unconnected.\nIf present polling is reflected in the February vote, the AfD is set to double its seat-count in the nation\u2019s parliament, the Bundestag, and be the second largest party after the CDU. Yet with two months to run and another terrorist attack against a German Christmas market in the headlines, nothing is yet decided.\nPlease let us know if you're having issues with commenting.\nCopyright \u00a9 2025 Breitbart",

She noted that while freedom of speech includes the right to express any opinion, including what she termed \u201cthe greatest nonsense,\u201d\u00a0it does not absolve individuals from the consequences of their words.\nThe AfD has been classified as a \u201csuspected\u201d extremist organization by Germany\u2019s domestic intelligence service due to its harsh anti-immigration and anti-establishment stance. The party is currently polling second behind the conservative CDU/CSU bloc, but remains widely shunned by other major parties, which have ruled out forming coalitions with it.\nIn his op-ed, Musk rebuffed criticism of the AfD, stating, \u201ctheir portrayal as far-right is clearly false.\u201d\n\u201cThe traditional parties have failed Germany.

Lars Klingbeil, co-leader of the Social Democratic Party (SPD), compared Musk to Russian President Vladimir Putin, alleging that both were trying to weaken Germany by supporting the AfD.\nA three-way coalition led by Chancellor Olaf Scholz collapsed in early November amid internal disputes over spending priorities. On December 16, the German leader lost a confidence vote in the Bundestag, heralding the end of his tenure at the helm of a minority government. A snap election has been scheduled for February 23.\nFounded in 2013, the AfD has become more popular in recent years.

The SPD's co-leader criticized Musk's actions as similar to Russian interference in elections.",

Please!\u201d\nGermany\u2019s domestic intelligence agency has classified the AfD at the national level as a suspected extremism case since 2021.\nMusk uses populist and personal language to try to deny AfD\u2019s extremist bent.\nOn Monday, German government spokeswoman Christiane Hoffmann said that \u201cit is a fact that Elon Musk is trying to exert influence on the parliamentary election\u201d.\n\u201cIn Germany, elections are decided by voters at the ballot box,\u201d she told a regular press conference, adding that the country\u2019s \u201celections are a matter for Germans\u201d.\nEurope\u2019 biggest economy will head to the polls on February 23 after the collapse of centre-left Chancellor Olaf Scholz\u2019s unruly coalition government last month.\nAdvertisement\n\n\nHoffmann said that Musk \u201cis free to express his opinion, but one doesn\u2019t have to share it\u201d.\nShe recalled that various branches of the AfD have been labelled \u201cextremist\u201d by Germany\u2019s domestic security agency.\nLars Klingbeil, co-leader of Scholz\u2019s Social Democrats (SPD), told the Funke media group that Musk \u201cis trying the same thing as Vladimir Putin\u201d, the Russian president.\n\u201cThey both want to influence our elections and support the AfD, which is hostile to democracy,\u201d he said, accusing both Musk and Putin of \u201cwanting Germany to be weakened and pushed into chaos\u201d.\nKlingbeil said more action was needed on the European level to restrict the political power of big social media platforms such as X.\nMusk has repeatedly used X to attack Scholz personally, most recently in the wake of a deadly car-ramming attack on a Christmas market in the eastern city of Magdeburg on December 20.\nMusk called Scholz an \u201cincompetent fool\u201d and said he \u201cshould resign immediately\u201d.\nMusk\u2019s interventions in German politics have also been criticised by Scholz\u2019s main rival, the leader of the conservative opposition CDU/CSU, Friedrich Merz.\nMerz labelled Musk\u2019s AfD endorsement as \u201cinterfering and presumptuous\u201d and said he could not remember \u201ca comparable case of meddling in the election campaign of an allied country in the history of Western democracy\u201d.\nThe AfD is in second place in the latest polls at 19%, behind the CDU/CSU opposition, which is at 32%.\nThe SPD is headed for its worst-ever result at 16%, while its Green coalition partners are polling at 13%.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAuthor\n\nAFP\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                View 74 comments\n            \n\nSend Tip or Correction\n\n\n\n\n\nEmbed this post\nTo embed this post, copy the code below on your site\n\n600px wide\n<iframe width=\"600\" height=\"460\" frameborder=\"0\" style=\"border:0px;\" src=\"https://www.thejournal.ie/https://www.thejournal.ie/german-government-elon-musk-influence-elections-6583022-Dec2024/?embedpost=6583022&width=600&height=460\" ></iframe>\n\n\n400px wide\n<iframe width=\"600\" height=\"460\" frameborder=\"0\" style=\"border:0px;\" src=\"https://www.thejournal.ie/https://www.thejournal.ie/german-government-elon-musk-influence-elections-6583022-Dec2024/?embedpost=6583022&width=400&height=460\" ></iframe>\n\n\n300px wide\n<iframe width=\"600\" height=\"460\" frameborder=\"0\" style=\"border:0px;\" src=\"https://www.thejournal.ie/https://www.thejournal.ie/german-government-elon-musk-influence-elections-6583022-Dec2024/?embedpost=6583022&width=300&height=460\" ></iframe>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n            Email \u201cGerman government accuses Elon Musk of 'exerting influence' on parliamentary elections\u201d.\n        \n\n\n\nYour Email\n\n\n\n\n\nRecipient's Email\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFeedback on \u201cGerman government accuses Elon Musk of 'exerting influence' on parliamentary elections\u201d.\n\n\nYour Feedback\n\n\n\n\nYour Email (optional)\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReport a Comment\n\n\nPlease select the reason for reporting this comment.\n\n\n                        Please select your reason for reporting...\n                    \n\n                        It contains offensive language, is hateful or incites violence\n                    \n\n                        It contains a libellous/defamatory statement\n                    \n\n                        Some other reason...\n                    \n\n\n\n\nPlease give full details of the problem with the comment...\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClose\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                    74                    Comments\n                \n\n\n\n                This is YOUR comments community.

Large sections of the party have been designated extremist by German domestic intelligence and placed under surveillance.\nSaskia Esken, SPD co-leader, harshly criticised the Musk article. \u201cOur democracy is capable of defending itself, and is not for sale,\u201d she told Reuters.\n\u201cWhoever tries to influence our election from outside, whoever supports an anti-democratic, misanthropic party like the AfD\u2026 should expect fierce resistance from us,\u201d she said.\nMatthias Miersch, SPD general secretary, also attacked Axel Springer, the media conglomerate that owns Welt am Sonntag., saying it was \u201cshameful and dangerous\u201d that the company had provided Musk with a platform to campaign for the AfD.\n[\u00a0Bluesky may be in danger of becoming Elon Musk\u2019s black mirrorOpens in new window\u00a0]\nAndreas Audretsch, a senior Green MP who is leading the party\u2019s election campaign, also criticised Musk\u2019s article.\n\u201cIt damages our democracy when Herr Musk, the Chinese state or Moscow\u2019s troll factories subvert our democratic discourse,\u201d he said.\nWelt comment editor Eva Marie Kogel announced over the weekend that she was resigning, in a sign of the anger the decision to publish the Musk piece generated in the paper\u2019s newsroom.\n\u201cJournalism lives off independence and credibility, Die Welt lives off its reputation,\u201d said Mika Beuster, head of the DJV, the German journalists\u2019 association. \u201cAll of that is being thrown, with a great clatter, in the dustbin.\u201d\nInsiders at Axel Springer, which also owns Politico, rejected the claim that, by publishing the Musk article, they were providing a platform to the billionaire and the far right.\n[\u00a0The old order of globalisation may be collapsing \u2013 and bringing Germany with itOpens in new window\u00a0]\n\u201cHe\u2019s the owner of Twitter and with one tweet he can reach 200 million people,\u201d said one. \u201cWho is Welt to give him a platform?

Better to publish this on our platform where we can guard it and flank it with our own opinion.\u201d\nIn his article, Musk, a close adviser to US president-elect Donald Trump and a friend of Axel Springer chief executive Mathias D\u00f6pfner, praised the AfD\u2019s policies of market deregulation, tax cuts and cutting red tape, as well as its opposition to immigration.\nHe also dismissed the idea that the party was \u201cright-wing extremist\u201d, noting that its co-leader, Alice Weidel, is in a same-sex relationship with a woman from Sri Lanka. \u201cDoes that sound to you like Hitler? Please!\u201d he wrote.\nMerz said Musk had \u201coverlooked\u201d a few important points in his article, saying he would never have been able to build his Tesla factory in the east German state of Brandenburg with the AfD.

A Predator Presenter and Ballroom Bullying: The U.K.'s Top Entertainment Scandals of 2024  Friedrich Merz, the chancellor candidate for the conservative CDU party, called Musk\u2019s intervention \u201coverreaching and presumptuous,\u201d describing it as an unprecedented interference in Germany\u2019s democracy. \u201cI cannot recall a comparable case of interference in the election campaign of a friendly country in the history of Western democracies,\u201d Merz told the Funke Media Group.

            "content": "Elon Musk's election appeal for the nationalist Alternative for Germany party set off a storm of criticism in Germany. But what is everyone up in arms about?\nUS tech billionaire Elon Musk on Saturday reaffirmed his backing for Germany's far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD)\u00a0in an op-ed published by the Welt am Sonntag newspaper. This came just days after he had posted on his social network X that \"only the AfD can save Germany.\"\nHe wrote that the nationalist party was\u00a0\"the last spark of hope for the country,\" which he claimed was teetering on the brink of \"economic and cultural collapse,\" and that only the AfD could revive the German economy and prevent a loss of identity through a \"controlled immigration policy.\"\n\"To those who condemn the AfD as extremist, I say: Don't let the label attached to it put you off,\" Musk wrote.\u00a0\"The portrayal of the AfD as right-wing extremist is clearly false, considering that Alice Weidel, the party's leader, has a same-sex partner from Sri Lanka! Does that sound like Hitler to you? Please!\"\nIn the article, published in German, Musk also praised the AfD's approach to regulation, taxes and market deregulation.\nAlthough it was published as\u00a0an op-ed by designated Welt editor-in-chief Jan Philipp Burgard, the decision to print it was met with protests by Welt editorial staff\u00a0and led to the resignation of a senior editor at Welt am Sonntag.\nTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video\nFriedrich Merz, the center-right\u00a0candidate for chancellor in Germany's February 23 legislative election, lashed out at Musk, calling the article unprecedented interference that was \"intrusive and pretentious.\"\nThe AfD is currently polling at 20% and in second place behind Merz's conservative alliance of Christian Democratic Union (CDU) and Christian Social Union (CSU).\nThe chairman of the center-left Social Democrats (SPD),\u00a0Lars Klingbeil, accused Musk of wanting to \"plunge Germany into chaos\" and compared him to Russian President Vladimir Putin.\n\"Both want to influence our elections and specifically support the AfD's enemies of democracy,\"\u00a0Klingbeil said.\nThe chairman of the DJV journalists' association, Mika Beuster, warned editorial offices not to allow themselves to be instrumentalized in the run-up to the general election but\u00a0to handle guest contributions with care.\n\"German media must not allow themselves to be misused as mouthpieces for autocrats and their friends,\" he said.\nTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video\nCan the press in Germany speak out for or against political candidates in the run-up to elections? The answer is yes, it is permitted in Germany, but it tends to be the exception.\nFreedom of expression and press freedom are enshrined in the constitution. Article 5 of Germany's Basic Law reads: \"Every person shall have the right freely to express and disseminate his opinions in speech, writing and pictures and to inform himself without hindrance from generally accessible sources.

However, this does not exclude the possibility of individuals expressing opinions in journalistic commentaries that could also be understood as election recommendations.\nIt is still unclear exactly how Musk's text ended up in the conservative Welt newspaper, which is owned by the Springer publishing group. Springer CEO Mathias D\u00f6pfner has expressed admiration for Musk in the past, and he is said to have personal contact with the billionaire.\nD\u00f6pfner has repeatedly made headlines when internal chat messages and emails he sent to his confidants became public, showing him\u00a0lambasting the measures to combat the COVID-19 pandemic and climate change.\nD\u00f6pfner\u00a0also attempted to influence the reporting of the Bild newspaper in favor of the neoliberal Free Democrats (FDP) ahead of the last federal election in 2021. \"Our last hope is the FDP,\" and only if the Liberals finished strong could \"the green-red disaster be avoided,\" D\u00f6pfner reportedly wrote, warning of a SPD-Green coalition government.\nMore recently, D\u00f6pfner criticized journalism in Germany, saying that \"elitist quality media\"\u00a0were biased towards the AfD, which suggests the decision to publish Musk's op-ed could\u00a0be seen as an attempt to normalize right-wing populist thinking in Germany.\nThe daily newspaper Welt\u00a0was founded in post-war West\u00a0Germany in the British occupation zone in April 1946. Seven years later, the publisher Axel Springer took over the paper. Today, the Springer publishing group is active in more than 40 countries and owns the Politico news sites. Springer exerts great influence on the political debate in Germany, particularly with its tabloid Bild \u2014 which is\u00a0the newspaper most criticized by the German Press Council.\nTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video\nThe richest man in the world, first and foremost, appears to have\u00a0his own economic interests in mind. In his op-ed, Musk praises the AfD for its plans to \"reduce government overregulation, lower taxes and deregulate the market.\" ATesla plant in Brandenburg, outside Berlin, is the US manufacturer's first electric car factory in Europe and would stand to profit from such changes.\nBut Musk, with his 200 million online followers worldwide, is seen as driving a global political agenda to promote right-wing forces. He allegedly promised British right-wing populist Nigel Farage's party donations of \u20ac95 million in support.\nHe also contributed at least $250 million to US President-elect Donald Trump's election campaign and has since been named co-head of a department designed to cut government spending and restructure the federal government with no clear oversight from elected lawmakers.\nIn Germany, Musk's support for the AfD could act as a door opener for far-right forces by increasing their visibility and legitimizing their narrative.\nThis article was originally written in German.\nWhile you're here: Every Tuesday, DW editors round up what is happening in German politics and society.

            "content": "SUBSCRIBE & SAVE\nLess than $3 per week\nThe tech billionaire has faced a vocal backlash after backing far-right movement shunned by mainstream parties\nHe played a crucial role in Donald Trump's election victory; he has launched scathing attacks on the UK's Keir Starmer; and now, Elon Musk is meddling in our politics too, said Hannes Niemeyer in Frankfurter Rundschau (Frankfurt). Ahead of Germany's federal elections in February, the billionaire has been using his X/Twitter site to urge people to vote for the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD).\nBut what has really enraged Germany's political classes is an opinion piece he wrote in the Sunday edition of Die Welt, in which he described the country as on \"the brink of economic and cultural collapse\". \"The description of AfD as far-right is made obviously false simply by noting that Alice Weidel, the party leader, has a same-sex partner from Sri Lanka!\" he added. \"Does that sound like Hitler to you?\" A fierce backlash ensued: Die Welt's opinion editor resigned, and Musk was subjected to a barrage of cross-party criticism. But it hasn't put him off: on the contrary, he has stepped up his attacks on Chancellor Olaf Scholz and other establishment figures.\nMusk is \"the greatest entrepreneurial genius of our time\", said Jan Philipp Burgard in Die Welt (Berlin): his innovations, built on a \"radical analysis of the status quo\", have \"revolutionised the payment, automotive and space industries\". And his diagnosis of Germany's ills isn't far wrong: we are indeed in an \"economic and cultural crisis\", owing to the misguided energy, migration and social policies initiated by Angela Merkel and largely continued by Scholz's disastrous \"traffic light\" coalition. But his claim that only the AfD can save us is \"fatally wrong\". This is a party that wants to take Germany out of the EU \u2013 a crazy idea for an economy so heavily reliant on EU exports. It wants to realign Germany with Russia, at the likely expense of its ties with the US and its international credibility.\nEscape your echo chamber.

Still, you don't have to agree with Musk to defend our right to publish a piece by him, said Veronika Grimm in the same paper. His Tesla car firm has a huge factory near Berlin, where the AfD is second in opinion polls. That his piece triggered such a furore is a sad indictment of free speech today.\nMusk may have interesting things to say, said Meredith Haaf in S\u00fcddeutsche Zeitung (Munich), but all he gave us in his opinion piece were \"pessimistic platitudes\" and all-too familiar denials of the AfD's xenophobia. And his calls for less regulation and bureaucracy were plainly designed to boost his own business interests, said Stefan Fries on Deutschlandfunk (Berlin). Yet it was the Axel Springer group, which owns Die Welt, that allegedly approached him to write the piece in the first place. Why? Because Springer has been expanding into the US and sees Musk as vital to its interests there. So yes, for Die Welt to give house room to Musk's musings was a \"journalistic error and a transgression\"; but on the upside, it has sparked a debate about the cosy relationship between politics and business that is poisoning our democracy.\nAnd nobody typifies this relationship more than Musk, said Lea Fauth in Die Tageszeitung (Berlin): he's the living embodiment of \"personal profit, close contacts in politics, and massive influence on public opinion\", yet he's lauded as an \"anti-establishment\" hero. No serious newspaper should publish anything by such a man, one notorious for spreading disinformation and \"fake news\" online.\nLet's not over-dramatise, said Beatrice Achterberg in Neue Z\u00fcrcher Zeitung (Zurich). Have those who see Musk's opinion as a sign of democracy's demise forgotten that the US businessman George Soros urged voters to back pro-European parties in 2019's EU elections? Or that Germany's Die Zeit published a piece by Vladimir Putin as recently as 2021? The fact is, it's completely normal for German newspapers to run guest articles by high-profile figures. As for the AfD, for too long it has benefitted from being treated as a pariah: doing so has simply burnished its anti-establishment credentials. So to go on trying to silence those who support the party will only serve to aid its cause further.

Elections will be held next month. Scholz came to power after the sixteen-year reign of Angela Merkel, but has become unpopular amid a stagnant economy\u2014one that was once the pride, if not exactly the envy, of the continent. The favorite in the election is the center-right Christian Democratic Union (C.D.U.)\u2014which Merkel once led\u2014although support for the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) has been growing in the country\u2019s east. (Elon Musk recently made news, and attracted Scholz\u2019s scorn, for saying that he hoped the populist AfD, which is defined above all else by its extreme hostility to immigrants, would win the election.) The most likely result is another coalition government, this one led by the C.D.U. and including the Social Democrats.To better understand the state of German politics, I recently spoke by phone with Hans Kundnani, the author of multiple books about the country, and the former head of the Europe Programme at Chatham House, a British think tank. During our conversation, which has been edited for length and clarity, we discussed how Merkel\u2019s once vaunted legacy set her successor up to fail, how the German far right is distinct from its European counterparts, and whether the lack of disagreement among Germany\u2019s major political parties is a threat to its democracy.What do you see as Germany\u2019s central political problems? And do you view these as sui generis, compared to other countries experiencing political instability?What you have in German politics is a permanent grand coalition. When Angela Merkel became Chancellor, in 2005, there had only ever been one grand coalition in the history of the Federal Republic. Since then, grand coalitions have become the norm. She led a grand coalition for three of her four terms in office. Under Scholz, we had this so-called \u201ctraffic light\u201d coalition, which is not technically a grand coalition because it doesn\u2019t include the Christian Democrats, but it\u2019s functionally a grand coalition. And that\u2019s partly to do with the way that it includes parties from across the political spectrum. You have the Social Democrats on the center left, you have the Greens, who at least on some issues are a left-wing party, but then you have the Free Democrats, which is very much a right-wing party.But there is such a consensus in the center ground of German politics that basically all the parties that might be in government agree on nearly everything. The differences are really very minor, which is very different from the United States. So I think of the Scholz government as a continuation of the Merkel consensus. And in the last election, three years ago, the two leading candidates\u2014Scholz, who was the Social Democrat candidate for Chancellor, and Armin Laschet, who was the Christian Democrat candidate\u2014were essentially competing with each other to persuade the German people that they were more like Merkel than their opponent. Since Scholz became Chancellor, the outbreak of the war in Ukraine has forced him to shift on certain things, especially about the need to spend more on defense and to look for alternate sources of energy.Even if Germany is quite distinct in the manner of how much consensus there is, it\u2019s also true that voters elsewhere in Europe and in the United States are unhappy with incumbent governments.I think the anti-incumbency mood that you are talking about is a response to the failure of centrist governments to offer citizens solutions to their problems. France is a good example, where the far right, in particular, is getting stronger and stronger, and that then forces the centrist parties to close ranks and join forces against the extreme. This is very much how Emmanuel Macron presented himself when he first ran for the French Presidency. But that then means that they don\u2019t really have a program that offers citizens very much and then the far right gets stronger. I think there is a version of that happening in Germany.Do you think that the failures of Merkel\u2019s sixteen years are responsible for the failure of this current government, in the sense of the decisions she made and their impact? I\u2019m thinking of the initiative to get closer to Russia, of rejecting nuclear power, and of immigration, whatever you think of the moral weight of her decision on accepting refugees?I think Merkel has been an absolute disaster for Germany in every possible way, and you\u2019ve mentioned some of the ways in which she\u2019s been disastrous for Germany. There\u2019s another dimension to this, less often discussed, which is that there was something quite anti-democratic about Merkel. The AfD is explicitly a response to her \u201cno alternative\u201d politics. Even their name was a response to Merkel\u2019s assertion that there was no alternative to her approach to the Euro crisis.It\u2019s important to emphasize that it was a consensus, so, in a way, it\u2019s a little unfair to just blame Merkel. Merkel was just the expression of that consensus, and this brings me back to the point about grand coalitions. On all of these decisions, whether it\u2019s economic-policy decisions\u2014so, for example, we could talk about the debt brake\u2014or whether it\u2019s foreign-policy decisions like the German approach to China and Russia, this wasn\u2019t just Merkel pushing this through; this was a consensus in German politics that included the Social Democrats.Can you talk about the debt brake?The debt brake was this limit on government debt and deficits that was introduced in the first Merkel grand coalition, in 2009. This was Germany\u2019s response to the global financial crisis, which was to write into the German constitution a limit on the deficit and on debt.Peer Steinbr\u00fcck, the Social Democrat finance minister, was the key figure in that. Merkel got most of the remaining E.U. member states to agree to a similar debt brake. This has been absolutely disastrous, both for Germany and for the rest of Europe, because it\u2019s limited much-needed investment in everything from infrastructure to education to defense.I mention all that, because the one good thing that might come out of the grand coalition that we are likely to have after the election at the end of February is to get rid of the debt brake.And how, specifically, do you see the decisions she made about closeness to Russia?There was a consensus in the West\u2014which was particularly strong in Germany, but it was also shared around the rest of Europe and even in the United States\u2014that the more economic interdependence you had with China and Russia, the more they would become \u201ccivilized.\u201d I think Europeans believed it more than Americans, and I think within Europe Germans believed it even more. And so the German version of this, which was particularly extreme, was called \u201cchange through trade.\u201d It would make China and Russia responsible stakeholders in international systems, but it would also push them toward democratization. After the Russian annexation of Crimea, in 2014, and even going further back, to Putin\u2019s speeches in 2007, you could see this wasn\u2019t happening, but the Germans really dug in on this.After Crimea, though, Merkel was widely praised for having co\u00f6rdinated E.U. sanctions against Russia in response to the Russian annexation. In fact, I remember people talking about how Germany, after 2014, had had a geopolitical awakening and had all of its illusions about Russia shattered, and it was now adopting a much more hardheaded approach embodied by these economic sanctions, which were actually quite limited. At the same time, Merkel was shutting down discussion about any kind of military response to Russian actions in Ukraine. Obama was President, and he was trying to start a debate about whether we should arm the Ukrainians, and Merkel immediately shut that down.Perhaps even more important, what then happens is that Merkel pushes ahead with the creation of Nord Stream 2 [a natural-gas pipeline running between Russia and Germany]. In fact, part of her response to the Russian annexation of Crimea is to double down on this energy interdependence with Russia. She was still, I think, very much  in thrall to this idea that that was a way of reducing conflict with Russia. There was also a certain amount of cynicism, I think, because this meant cheap gas for German corporations, and Merkel was very much in the pocket of big German corporations.After Russia invaded Ukraine in 2022, there was discussion that the Scholz government would start reorienting toward alternative sources of energy, and that there was some need to spend more on defense. To what degree have these things actually happened in the last almost three years?Germany did wean itself off Russian gas very quickly. It didn\u2019t have much choice. I think that change never comes from within Germany; it\u2019s always in response to outside pressures, because Germany is so attached to the status quo, in contrast to the United States, which is a very dynamic kind of society.What I think hasn\u2019t yet happened is much of a shift on German policy toward China. After the war in Ukraine breaks out in 2022, the immediate question is: What about German policy toward China? In some ways, that\u2019s even more difficult, because Russia was a source of energy, but it wasn\u2019t that significant as an export market. China is such an important export market for Germany. This is a challenge on a whole different scale.This is a bigger issue, which is both central to the E.U.\u2019s problems internally and to the relationship of Germany and the E.U. to the rest of the world, and that is the dependence of the German economy on exports. This brings us to the long trajectory that goes back at least to Merkel. Domestic demand is very low, and this is a problem for the rest of Europe. In the last couple years, there\u2019s a sense that the German economy has become too dependent on China, specifically. The German response to that is: Well, we need to diversify our export markets, rather than questioning the over-all dependence of the German economy on exports, which is the real problem.You said you thought there\u2019s likely going to be a new coalition that comes to power in February. What do you think that coalition is going to be?It looks as if it\u2019ll be a C.D.U.-led coalition, but it\u2019s almost certainly going to be a grand coalition. In other words, the coalition of the Christian Democrats and the Social Democrats. But now it\u2019s not even clear that between them the Christian Democrats and the Social Democrats will have enough seats in Parliament to form a grand coalition. You might need a third coalition partner, like the Greens. So it would be a super grand coalition, which has now become the norm in German politics. And the traffic-light coalition three years ago was an attempt to not have yet another grand coalition, because there are all kinds of problems with having a permanent grand coalition, which everybody recognizes is disastrous from a democratic perspective, but there isn\u2019t really an alternative to it.We have seen established center-right parties disappear, but we also see some of them essentially just taken over by the far right, such as the G.O.P. in America. And we\u2019ve seen some adopt more far-right ideas on things like immigration and so on. What is the C.D.U. doing?The center right\u2019s response to what it would call the rise of populism is to accept that the far right is speaking to legitimate concerns around excessive immigration, so therefore the center right needs to become tougher on immigration. But its response to the rise of populism has not been to say, broadly speaking, \u201cWell, we think that they have some legitimate concerns around economic policy\u201d\u2014basically neoliberalism. They\u2019re focussed on the cultural side. They believe they can defeat the far right by adopting far-right ideas around identity and immigration and Islam. And that, again, is a Europe-wide phenomenon.But the AfD is really interesting because if you look at, say, Giorgia Meloni in Italy or even Marine Le Pen in France, in the last few years they have at least selectively moderated in certain policy areas. In particular, they\u2019ve moderated their Euroskepticism. Now, there\u2019s a big debate about how real that moderation is, how much it might change now that Trump has become President. But at least they\u2019re playing with the idea that they\u2019re becoming more moderate. The AfD is going in the opposite direction, becoming more radical over time, and still getting stronger in the polls. A lot of people hoped that Germany was an exception, that its history had somehow made it immune to the rise of the far right. I think it now almost seems as if it\u2019s an exception in a negative sense\u2014that you have a party that\u2019s getting stronger and stronger, and yet becoming more and more radical over time.I read a piece that you wrote in 2017 saying why the AfD could be \u201cgood for German democracy.\u201d It wasn\u2019t at all pro-AfD, but can you explain your argument and, I assume, why you don\u2019t believe it anymore?It wasn\u2019t really praising the AfD in any way. It was driving at the comparative idea that in the United States the shock of Trump being elected in 2016 forced the Democrats to rethink a lot of their assumptions around economic policy. That\u2019s how you get Bidenomics. I hoped that the shock of the AfD getting into the Bundestag in 2017 and becoming the leading opposition party would force the center-left and center-right parties in Germany to rethink some of their assumptions.Now, that didn\u2019t happen, in particular, because the center-right parties, including the C.D.U., drew all the wrong lessons from the rise of the AfD. But then, on top of that, the AfD has also changed. Even after it shifted away from its initial focus on economic policy, against giving money to other European states, it became about the refugee crisis and it became more radical.There is a distinction in Germany between the so-called radical right and the extreme right. Radical-right parties, which are often what we would call right-wing populist parties, may have extreme positions on particular issues like immigration, but the idea is that they\u2019re not challenging democracy itself. Once you cross that line and you do start to challenge democracy itself, or the liberal democracy of the German constitution, then you are categorized as an extreme-right party. That means that the German domestic intelligence service, the equivalent of the F.B.I., monitors you and investigates you and potentially prosecutes you. What\u2019s been happening over the last few years in Germany is that the AfD in individual states, particularly in the east of Germany, are being categorized as extreme right rather than radical right. Now, the AfD as a whole nationally is not yet categorized in that way, but it\u2019s on its way to becoming an extreme-right party. It\u2019s increasingly becoming basically a neo-Nazi party, which is something different from just a radical-right or populist party,We\u2019re two weeks from Donald Trump being inaugurated, Italy is run by the far right, and France, in two years, could be run by the far right\u2014but there\u2019s really no chance that the AfD can come to power next month.That\u2019s right.So then there\u2019s something to be said for the German political system and all these things we\u2019ve talked about, the over-compromising and the parties being similar?We don\u2019t need to worry as much about the AfD as we need to worry about, say, Le Pen becoming the French President. We see the same toxic dynamic in Germany as elsewhere, it just may be a little bit less advanced. In response to the rise of populism or the far right, the centrist parties tend to close ranks, and that in turn strengthens both far-left and far-right parties even more. This strengthens the sense that the centrist parties form a bloc or a cartel, and that voting for them doesn\u2019t change anything, and therefore the only way to change anything is by voting for more radical parties.Part of the problem that we\u2019ve had since 2016 is that we\u2019ve become so fixated on one particular threat to democracy, which is the threat from populism, that we\u2019ve tended to think that that\u2019s the only possible threat to democracy. As long as you don\u2019t have populist parties in power, then everything\u2019s fine in your democracy. Studying the European Union, and in particular studying Germany, makes you realize that there are multiple threats to democracy.I\u2019ve always thought that, in some ways, the problem with democracy in Germany is almost the opposite of the problems in American democracy. In the United States, obviously you have this problem of polarization. In some ways, Germany\u2019s not polarized enough. And then on top of that you\u2019ve got the problem of technocracy, by which I mean a massive growth of technocratic institutions in Europe and Germany, sometimes called counter-majoritarian institutions, and economic decision-making has been outsourced to them. What that does is take these decisions out of the space of democratic contestation. So technocracy is also a threat to democracy; it\u2019s almost the opposite threat from populism, but it\u2019s also a threat, because we\u2019ve become so fixated on the problem of populism in Germany. This is against the background, particularly, of Trump.Maybe this comes down to the distinction between threats to democracy and problems with democracy, because when we talk about the C.D.U. and the Social Democrats competing for the same voters in another boring centrist election in Germany, I can see the different ways in which the lack of real choice is a problem for democracy. I\u2019m not sure I see it in the way January 6th is a threat.Well, this is what I mean. We\u2019ve become so fixated on things like January 6th. I think the German issue is absolutely a threat to democracy. One of the fascinating things about the rise of populism\u2014and this goes for Trump in the U.S., but it also goes for the AfD in Germany\u2014is that in the 2017 elections, the AfD brought 1.2 million non-voters back into the democratic process. This is part of the problem with our debates about populism, because we see it exclusively as a threat, but it can also be a corrective for a crisis of liberal democracy. If you have declining voter turnout where voters are switching off from the whole democratic process, that is a threat to democracy. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s enough to just say it\u2019s a problem for democracy.But it\u2019s a little tautological to say that the threat is centrism as well as the far right, because people are going to stop voting thanks to centrism, and they will be drawn back by the far right. You are still saying the far right is the threat.I guess so, yeah. But this is the way in which this centrist consensus itself produces populism. So yeah, you end up in the same place through a different route. And this part of the discussion started because you said, \u201cWell, look, but maybe we can relax about Germany,\u201d right?Is it right that the AfD seems to have some ceiling of support given that Germany is in some sense two distinct countries still, and the AfD is just not going to have real support in the West?It\u2019s a little more complicated. There is this temptation to think that the problem of the far right is an East German problem, not a West German problem. Because you have an increasingly radical AfD that is able to do quite well in eastern Germany means that you don\u2019t have the same kind of pressures on a far-right party to become more moderate as you do in, say, Italy or France, because there\u2019s a strong enough base in those eastern German states as an incentive for them to continue to radicalize.\u00a0\u2666",

U\u011fur Tekiner explains why tension between idealism and a recent pragmatic shift in the party\u2019s European policy has contributed to its declining appeal.\n\nGerman voters will head to the polls on 23 February for federal elections. The German Social Democrats (SPD) \u2013 the biggest partner in the now defunct \u201ctraffic light coalition\u201d between the SPD, the Greens and the FDP \u2013 are performing poorly in opinion polls, even falling behind the far-right AfD. Expectations were high when the SPD rebounded at the 2021 German federal elections to win power, yet the party also faced substantial obstacles. The current situation shows it has been unable to surmount the latter.\nAn important element of this is the SPD\u2019s European policy, which plays a significant role in the party\u2019s performance at the national and European levels. Indeed, the first signals of the SPD\u2019s decline came during the European elections last year, when the party plummeted to third place with just under 14 per cent of the vote. The EU\u2019s state of \u201cpolycrisis\u201d during recent years has made European matters too important to ignore and this failure set the tone for the subsequent federal election campaign.\nPro-European idealism\nIn a new study, I trace the evolution of the SPD\u2019s European position since German reunification in 1990 using semi-structured interviews with 16 high-profile SPD party elites and archival research. Since reunification, the SPD has found itself increasingly caught between idealistic pro-Europeanism and domestic ideology-driven concerns about European integration. This conflict has led to a pragmatic shift in the party\u2019s official EU policy in the \u201cBerlin Republic\u201d.\nBefore reunification in 1990, the SPD had an idealistic commitment to the European project. The party\u2019s contributions to deepening European integration, particularly under their two historic chancellors Willy Brandt and Helmut Schmidt, were frequently cited at this time. Another supportive factor was the cross-party consensus that existed in Germany over Europe, notably between the SPD and the Christian Democrats.\nThis consensus helped entrench pro-European views in West German politics. However, it also largely eliminated ideological differences between the SPD and other parties when it came to Europe. In a sense, the SPD\u2019s idealism prevented it from making a social democratic case for supporting European integration. And this also diminished the political salience of Europe for the party.\nA pragmatic shift\nThis situation changed dramatically following reunification. First, like other mainstream parties, the SPD was forced to deal with a range of political, economic and social issues caused by reunification. Added to this was burgeoning public Euroscepticism that emerged during debates on replacing the Deutsche Mark with the euro. The SPD\u2019s growing concerns over European integration were evident in the fact that key party figures, including former leaders Hans-Jochen Vogel, Gerhard Schr\u00f6der and Oskar Lafontaine, were critical of elements of monetary integration at this time.\nSecond, Schr\u00f6der took an assertive policy line against the EU after taking office as Chancellor in 1998. The Schr\u00f6der government secured a reduction in German contributions to the EU budget in 1999 in a Thatcherite manner, rearranged seats in the EU Council of Ministers in 2000 and applied transitional restrictions on labour migration from Central and Eastern Europe prior to the EU\u2019s 2004 enlargement.\nAs several interviewees indicated, the final decision on transitional restrictions was mainly influenced by the SPD\u2019s intention to protect German workers from external competition, even if it came from inside the EU. Yet beyond surprising Germany\u2019s EU partners, not least France, and straining Germany-EU relations, these steps also reflected wider ideological concerns that fostered a pragmatic shift in the SPD\u2019s European agenda.\nCompeting visions\nWhile a \u201cUnited States of Europe\u201d was previously mentioned as a \u201cfinal destination\u201d in official party documents, this ceased to be party policy under Schr\u00f6der. Another crucial consequence of the SPD\u2019s pragmatic turn was that Europe gained rising political and ideological salience. In contrast to previous decades, Europe was now at the centre of programmatic debates, with the SPD trying to develop a distinct social democratic vision for the EU.\nThis was visible in attempts by SPD leaders to reshape the EU in line with their ideological agendas. Oskar Lafontaine sought to designate the EU as a collective answer to the encroachments of globalisation and Anglo-Saxon capitalism. In contrast, Schr\u00f6der\u2019s Neue Mitte (New Centre) aimed to reform the EU in a centrist manner in tandem with Tony Blair\u2019s New Labour.

U\u011fur Tekiner explains why tension between idealism and a recent pragmatic shift in the party\u2019s European policy has contributed to its declining appeal.\n\nGerman voters will head to the polls on 23 February for federal elections. The German Social Democrats (SPD) \u2013 the biggest partner in the now defunct \u201ctraffic light coalition\u201d between the SPD, the Greens and the FDP \u2013 are performing poorly in opinion polls, even falling behind the far-right AfD. Expectations were high when the SPD rebounded at the 2021 German federal elections to win power, yet the party also faced substantial obstacles. The current situation shows it has been unable to surmount the latter.\nAn important element of this is the SPD\u2019s European policy, which plays a significant role in the party\u2019s performance at the national and European levels. Indeed, the first signals of the SPD\u2019s decline came during the European elections last year, when the party plummeted to third place with just under 14 per cent of the vote. The EU\u2019s state of \u201cpolycrisis\u201d during recent years has made European matters too important to ignore and this failure set the tone for the subsequent federal election campaign.\nPro-European idealism\nIn a new study, I trace the evolution of the SPD\u2019s European position since German reunification in 1990 using semi-structured interviews with 16 high-profile SPD party elites and archival research. Since reunification, the SPD has found itself increasingly caught between idealistic pro-Europeanism and domestic ideology-driven concerns about European integration. This conflict has led to a pragmatic shift in the party\u2019s official EU policy in the \u201cBerlin Republic\u201d.\nBefore reunification in 1990, the SPD had an idealistic commitment to the European project. The party\u2019s contributions to deepening European integration, particularly under their two historic chancellors Willy Brandt and Helmut Schmidt, were frequently cited at this time. Another supportive factor was the cross-party consensus that existed in Germany over Europe, notably between the SPD and the Christian Democrats.\nThis consensus helped entrench pro-European views in West German politics. However, it also largely eliminated ideological differences between the SPD and other parties when it came to Europe. In a sense, the SPD\u2019s idealism prevented it from making a social democratic case for supporting European integration. And this also diminished the political salience of Europe for the party.\nA pragmatic shift\nThis situation changed dramatically following reunification. First, like other mainstream parties, the SPD was forced to deal with a range of political, economic and social issues caused by reunification. Added to this was burgeoning public Euroscepticism that emerged during debates on replacing the Deutsche Mark with the euro. The SPD\u2019s growing concerns over European integration were evident in the fact that key party figures, including former leaders Hans-Jochen Vogel, Gerhard Schr\u00f6der and Oskar Lafontaine, were critical of elements of monetary integration at this time.\nSecond, Schr\u00f6der took an assertive policy line against the EU after taking office as Chancellor in 1998. The Schr\u00f6der government secured a reduction in German contributions to the EU budget in 1999 in a Thatcherite manner, rearranged seats in the EU Council of Ministers in 2000 and applied transitional restrictions on labour migration from Central and Eastern Europe prior to the EU\u2019s 2004 enlargement.\nAs several interviewees indicated, the final decision on transitional restrictions was mainly influenced by the SPD\u2019s intention to protect German workers from external competition, even if it came from inside the EU. Yet beyond surprising Germany\u2019s EU partners, not least France, and straining Germany-EU relations, these steps also reflected wider ideological concerns that fostered a pragmatic shift in the SPD\u2019s European agenda.\nCompeting visions\nWhile a \u201cUnited States of Europe\u201d was previously mentioned as a \u201cfinal destination\u201d in official party documents, this ceased to be party policy under Schr\u00f6der. Another crucial consequence of the SPD\u2019s pragmatic turn was that Europe gained rising political and ideological salience. In contrast to previous decades, Europe was now at the centre of programmatic debates, with the SPD trying to develop a distinct social democratic vision for the EU.\nThis was visible in attempts by SPD leaders to reshape the EU in line with their ideological agendas. Oskar Lafontaine sought to designate the EU as a collective answer to the encroachments of globalisation and Anglo-Saxon capitalism. In contrast, Schr\u00f6der\u2019s Neue Mitte (New Centre) aimed to reform the EU in a centrist manner in tandem with Tony Blair\u2019s New Labour. Despite differing in their goals, these two discourses both highlighted the greater prominence of the EU as an ideological asset for the SPD.\nToday, as a result of the evolution of its European policy, the SPD\u2019s unconditional support for the EU has changed to a conditional approach. This does not mean the party\u2019s idealistic vision of European integration has entirely vanished. Rather, there is now tension between this idealism and the new pragmatism. These two competing approaches make it difficult for the SPD to speak with one voice about Europe, further contributing to the party\u2019s dismal outlook ahead of the federal elections.\nFor more information, see the author\u2019s accompanying paper in Ankara Review of European Studies.\n\nNote: This article gives the views of the\u00a0author, not the position of EUROPP \u2013 European Politics and Policy or the London School of Economics.

            "content": "Chancellor Olaf Sholz\u2019s government coalition imploded and his poll numbers are dismal. But, at his party\u2019s conference this weekend, he made it clear that he won\u2019t give up without a fight.\nThe majority of the 600 delegates at Saturday's conference for the center-left Social Democratic Party (SPD) in Berlin officially confirmed Chancellor Olaf Scholz as the\u00a0party's\u00a0top candidate in Germany's upcoming parliamentary election.\nThe 66-year-old Scholz's governing coalition of the SPD, Greens and neoliberal Free Democrats (FDP) failed dramatically at the end of 2024, sparking a vote of no confidence that resulted in the snap election\\ scheduled for February 23.\nNow, according to a poll by public broadcaster ARD, 77% of Germans are dissatisfied with Scholz's leadership, and the SPD squabbled for weeks about whether one of their more popular members should\u00a0lead the campaign.\nScholz, who possesses a singular self-confidence and avoids basing his actions on polls, is likely to have been unmoved by these concerns. With his political survival at stake, Scholz seemed decisive and combative at the party conference. If the SPD loses the Bundestag elections on February 23 as polls suggest that they will, Scholz's three-year term of office will have been the shortest in the last fifty years.\nThe SPD currently has just under half of the support that poll respondents have expressed for the conservative Christian Democrats (CDU) and their Bavarian allies, the Christian Social Union (CSU). But a lot could still happen between now and election day \u2014 at least that's what SPD members are telling each other.\n\"It's a damn serious time, a time when dramatic things are happening,\" Scholz said in his nearly hourlong speech to SPD members.\u00a0\"These are things that no one would have thought possible just a few years ago, perhaps even a few months or even weeks ago.\"\nThe January 20 swearing-in of\u00a0Donald Trump\u00a0as US president is already fomenting diplomatic angst, as he makes territorial claims to Greenland, the Panama Canal and Canada. He has also made the breathtaking demand that every NATO country contribute 5% of their economic output to defense, when only two-thirds of the members currently manage to meet their 2% commitment.\nTrump's antics could offer Scholz opportunities in the election campaign. At the party conference, he once again rejected Trump's claims: \"The principle of the inviolability of borders applies to every country, regardless of whether it is to the east or west of us. Every state must adhere to this principle. No country is the backyard of another. No small country should have to fear its larger neighbor. That is at the core of what we call Western values, our values,\"\u00a0he said.\nFor some, the speech was a hopeful reminder of 2003, when the SPD chancellor,\u00a0Gerhard Schr\u00f6der, opposed US President George W. Bush's invasion of Iraq during his election campaign. His opposition earned him enough support to land a surprise win in the Bundestag elections.\nSPD members know that international affairs are likely to become even more turbulent after Trump takes office. \"This is also a time when certain forces in America are working very specifically to destroy our democratic institutions in the West,\"\u00a0Scholz warned. \"A time in which we cannot be sure how our relationship with the US will develop in the coming years.\"\nRussia invaded Ukraine almost three years ago, and the war has been raging ever since. The SPD stands by Ukraine \"without ifs or buts,\"\u00a0Scholz said, but added that as chancellor, he and his party would ensure \"that we are not dragged into this war.\"\n\"I will remain steadfast and level-headed, and all citizens in Germany can rely on that,\" Scholz said. \"My principles always apply. I never apply double standards.\"\nThe SPD hopes to mobilize nonvoters. In its 63-page program entitled \"More for you. Better for Germany,\"\u00a0the SPD focuses on a strong state, equity between rich and poor, and more investment in the economy, infrastructure and defense, financed by higher taxes for the rich and a bigger national debt. The reintroduction of a wealth tax and increased taxation of large inheritances are also included.\nTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video\nThe plan states that the welfare state should be preserved. \"Are we now making sure that ordinary people in Germany can get by with decent wages, affordable food and affordable rents? Or will ordinary people end up footing the bill for the CDU/CSU's tax giveaways to the rich and super-rich?\"\u00a0Scholz asked delegates. \"Are we now ensuring stable pensions, good health and care, intact schools and daycare centers \u2014 or are we cutting back everywhere on these things?\"\nThe SPD wants to set up what it calls the \"Germany Fund\"\u00a0to invest in electricity and heating grids, charging stations and housing construction. Additionally, the party wants to implement a \"Made in Germany\"\u00a0bonus: investments in machinery and equipment that would be subsidized with 10% of the purchase price via a tax refund.\nThe cost of these proposals hasn't been fully calculated. The German Economic Institute estimates that the funding gap amounts to \u20ac30 billion ($30.7 billion) per year, though the gap for the CDU and CSU program is three times that size.\nThe SPD also warns against turning \"to the right\"\u00a0on migration and asylum policy, saying Germany must remain a country that supports immigration. \"Three out of 10 people in our country have a history of immigration. Those who live and work here permanently, who are well integrated, who speak German, should be able to belong to our country, they should be able to have a say in our democracy,\"\u00a0Scholz said.\nThe country is at a \"crossroads,\"\u00a0Scholz said. \"If we take a wrong turn in Germany on February 23, we will wake up the next morning in a different country.\"\nThis article was originally written in German.",

            "summary": "Defense Minister Boris Pistorius has emerged as a leading candidate for the chancellorship within the Social Democratic Party (SPD), following the collapse of the coalition government. Despite his popularity and support from party members, Pistorius has remained loyal to current Chancellor Olaf Scholz. Since taking office in January 2023, Pistorius has focused on reforming the underfunded German armed forces amid the Ukraine conflict, pushing for significant arms purchases and the establishment of a permanent brigade in Lithuania. His straightforward approach has earned him respect, making him the most favored politician in Germany.",
            "content": "Defense Minister Boris Pistorius is the most popular German politician. Many party supporters would like to see him as the SPD's candidate for chancellor.\nIn recent days,\u00a0Boris Pistorius has been talked about as a possible candidate for chancellor for his center-left Social Democratic Party (SPD).\nAfter the collapse of the center-left coalition government at the beginning of November, this discussion has gathered pace: Pistorius was repeatedly brought into play as an alternative to Chancellor Olaf Scholz, who wants to lead his party into the election campaign again as the chancellor candidate, despite his poor approval ratings.\nSupport for Pistorius' possible candidacy comes\u00a0from the rank-and-file of his Social Democrat Party\u00a0as well as from prominent SPD members. Pistorius has refused to be drawn into the discussion, and has repeatedly emphasized his loyalty to Scholz.\nTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video\nWhen Pistorius was offered the position of German defense minister in January 2023, he\u00a0was confident enough to accept what is often regarded as a hot seat in Berlin politics.\u00a0Whoever is in charge of the chronically underfunded and poorly equipped Bundeswehr has been likely to make many mistakes.\nPistorius took office as defense minister on January 19, 2023, at a difficult time. The Russian invasion of Ukraine and subsequent German arms shipments to Kyiv revealed once again how poorly equipped the Bundeswehr was. Handing over some of its most powerful weapons systems to Ukraine, the Bundeswehr was left nearly empty-handed.\nHowever, Pistorius acted swiftly and decisively. A one-time appropriation budget of \u20ac100 billion ($105 billion) for the German army was approved by the government in June 2022, and Pistorius pushed ahead with a number of major arms purchases. This included urgently needed air defense systems, helicopters, tanks\u00a0and frigate warships.\nPistorius\u00a0pushed for a Bundeswehr brigade \u2014 around 5,000 soldiers \u2014 to be stationed permanently in Lithuania, where it is due to be operational by 2027. This decision marked a first in the history of German defense policy and was not without controversy, partly due to the high costs involved \u2014 all the more so as Pistorius had failed to secure significantly more money for the German army in the regular defense budget for 2025.\nPistorius' stated aim has been to successfully transform the German armed forces and make them operational again, while at the same time supporting Ukraine. The German armed forces are to\u00a0become \"ready for war\" again, as he put it \u2014 a choice of words that some critics found too aggressive. But for Pistorius, this simply means \"being ready to go to war in order to avoid having one.\"\nTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video\nPistorius quickly earned the respect and esteem of both the Cabinet and the troops. His hands-on, unpretentious manner and his straight talking has gone down well with the soldiers.\nWithin weeks of taking office, the new defense minister had climbed to the top of popularity polls, ahead of his colleagues in the Cabinet and Chancellor Scholz himself.\nPistorius is a candidate for the lower house of parliament, the Bundestag, in his home district of Hanover in Lower Saxony. This is where he gained his political experience at the local and state level,\u00a0serving for many years as regional interior minister.\nBorn on March 14, 1960, Pistorius grew up with his two brothers in Osnabr\u00fcck, a northern city in the German state of Lower Saxony. His mother was a local SPD politician, and he himself joined the SPD in 1976. After doing a business apprenticeship and the completion of his compulsory military service, he studied law. He then worked as a lawyer before deciding to pursue a career in local and state politics.\nIn 2006, Pistorius became mayor of Osnabr\u00fcck, where he had always been a loyal supporter of the local VFL soccer team. When the Social Democrats won the state election\u00a0in Lower Saxony in 2013, he became interior minister in the new coalition government between the SPD and the Greens.\nIn this new position, Pistorius made domestic security his main issue, strengthening the police force and initiating legislation to tighten gun laws. Pistorius remained interior minister in Lower Saxony for 10 years.\nBut while his political career was taking off, it was a difficult time for him privately. In 2015, his wife, with whom he has two daughters, died of cancer. Pistorius, who has described himself as \"a real family man,\"\u00a0remarried at the end of 2023.\nThis article was originally written in German.\nWhile you're here: Every Tuesday, DW editors round up what is happening in German politics and society.

            "content": "The German chancellor addressed lawmakers for the first time since his three-way coalition collapsed last week.\nGermany's conservative opposition sharply criticized center-left German Chancellor Scholz in a parliamentary session Wednesday that also saw more than 100 lawmakers back a ban of the far-right, anti-immigrant Alternative for Germany party (AfD).\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\nThe chancellor is trying to drum up support for legislation ahead of early elections set for February.\nScholz on Wednesday confirmed that a vote of confidence had been set for December 16, after the governing SPD/Greens/FDP coalition collapsed last week.\nThese live updates have been closed. Thank you for reading.\nBelow, you can read about developments in Germany's move toward early elections as they happened on Wednesday, November 13, 2024.\nDW Chief Political Editor Michaela K\u00fcfner described the contentious atmosphere in Berlin on Wednesday, outlining the impasses that both Chancellor Olaf Scholz and former Finance Minister Christian Lindner described in their remarks.\nK\u00fcfner said Scholz told parliamentarians that he had no choice but to fire Lindner last week, triggering the collapse of the ruling coalition. Scholz said Lindner had been trying to handcuff him into deciding between supporting Ukraine and making budget cuts at home or having no access to spending at all.\nDW's K\u00fcfner reported that Lindner, too, addressed fellow lawmakers. He argued that Scholz had been the problem, offering his finance minister slim options as well. Lindner said that ultimately his choice was between upholding the constitution or not.\nBavarian State Premier Markus S\u00f6der on Wednesday demanded expediency from Germany's outgoing SPD/Greens/FDP coalition, demanding, \"The confidence question must be put immediately and not next year\" and adding, \"there must be no tactical delays.\"\nS\u00f6der was in Berlin Wednesday to meet with Christian Democratic Union (CDU) leader Friedrich Merz after the collapse of Chancellor Olaf Scholz's government last week.\nS\u00f6der, who leads the CDU's Bavarian sister party the Christian Social Union (CSU), was himself in contention for the top spot on the CSU/CDU ballot early next year but bowed out in favor of Merz.\nSpeaking to reporters, S\u00f6der said, \"the chancellor question is decided. Friedrich Merz is doing it.\"\nDespite differences, S\u00f6der said he fully backed Merz, stressing that they were united by the shared aim of unseating the current government to \"get Germany back on track.\"\nMerz thanked S\u00f6der for his support and said his party had the \"firm intention of taking over leadership responsibility in this country again.\"\nBy stepping aside, S\u00f6der has left the path to the Chancellory open for Merz, an ambitious politician who served (in a strained relationship) under former Chancellor Angela Merkel before taking a job at the investment firm BlackRock and then returning to politics as an economic liberal with right-leaning tendencies on social issues and especially immigration.\nBavarian State Premier Markus S\u00f6der on Wednesday leveled harsh criticism at Olaf Scholz.\nS\u00f6der, who leads the Christian Social Union (CSU), the Bavarian sister party of the larger center-right Christian Democratic Union (CDU), said Scholz and Vice Chancellor Robert Habeck of the Greens were to blame for the \"disastrous situation\" that Germany now finds itself in.\n\"It takes courage to act as if you having nothing at all to do with the whole disaster. That is, ultimately, it was wholly failed finance policies that are the cause of all of Germany's budget problems.\"\nHabeck, said S\u00f6der, had become the face of the crisis, and continued to lambaste the outgoing coalition, saying it had left Germany, \"ungovernable.\"\nS\u00f6der's appearance in Berlin marked the first time the Bavarian had ever spoken in the Bundestag and he pulled no punches delivering his message, saying the coalition had severely damaged Germany's reputation at home and abroad.\n\"Laughter in Moscow, wrinkled foreheads in Europe and a grin from the US. You will go down as the weakest government in the history of the Federal Republic of Germany.\"\nFDP leader and former German Finance Minister Christian Lindneraccused Chancellor Olaf Scholz of failed economic policies.\u00a0Commenting on his resignation from the Chancellor last week, Lindner said: \"Sometimes a dismissal is also a liberation.\"\n\"Olaf Scholz's text says agenda, but there is no agenda in the text,\" he said\u00a0in the Bundestag, referring to a Chancellor's paper on economic policy presented to the coalition committee last week.\n\"If you're just running around in circles, you can't lead a progressive coalition,\" Lindner said.\nHowever,\u00a0Lindner still believes that Germany has what it takes to overcome the economic slump. \"Germany still has the potential for a strong comeback. We have the know-how, the capital, the brains,\" he said.\nTo achieve this, an economic policy that has been holding Germany back for more than a decade must be changed.\u00a0He added that Germany's values and interests could not be secured internationally \"by Germany lecturing others with a raised index finger\".\nLindner said: \"It is not moral feelings of superiority in foreign policy that secure our influence. Our economic strength is also our geopolitical strength.\"\n\"Our country must move from left to center,\" Lindner said, adding that\u00a0this election gives Germany such\u00a0an opportunity.\nForeign Minister Annalena Baerbock of the Green party spoke after Scholz's speech instead of Economy Minister Robert Habeck, who has been unable to attend the debate because of a problem with the\u00a0Bundeswehr\u00a0plane that was to bring him back from Lisbon.\nIn her speech, Baerbock emphasized Germany's strength and democratic principles despite insecurity in much of the rest of the world.\nShe stressed that she believed the German government under Scholz had taken responsibility for the problems the country does have, including in the field of energy supply, such as by weaning Germany off Russian gas amid Moscow's invasion of Ukraine.\nBaerbock also emphasized the need for a united Europe and strong Germany to face the challenges posed by the conflict in Ukraine and the climate crise.\nCDU leader Friedrich Merz accused Scholz of having rejected all his party's proposals to come to grips with illegal immigration.\nHe said any new government had to regain control over migration with expulsions at the border.\nMerz's Christian Democrats have been polling around 30% or more in the polls for a year now, while Scholz's Social Democrats, currently poll in\u00a0third place with around 16%, behind the AfD, which is at around 19%.\nWhile the main campaign issue will likely be the country's economy, immigration is another topic on the mind of German voters.\nThe leader of the Christian Democratic Union (CDU), Friedrich Merz, slammed Scholz after his speech, accusing him of being the person to split the country.\nHe called Scholz's alleged delay of the vote of confidence necessary for new elections \"simply unacceptable\" and a speech last week by the chancellor as \"unworthy of the leader of Germany.\"\nMerz insisted that the Bundestag was still capable of taking action, despite Scholz's no longer possessing a majority.\nHe said Germany needed a government that did not argue among itself along with a completely different political approach.\nMerz also stressed that he would not work together with the far-right AfD party, no matter how strong it became at new elections.\nThe CDU has been leading nationwide surveys for some months now, with Merz seen widely as favorite to win the planned snap elections in February.\nTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video\nScholz used his speech to call for more harmony in society, using the rifts made apparent by the recent US elections as a warning example.\nHe said he never wanted the degree of polarization in Germany to reach the same pitch.\nScholz said he had talked with US President-elect Donald Trump, stressing that US-Germany ties should remain good.\nScholz said he had a \"good conversation\" with Trump.\n\"We should do everything we can in the coming decades, regardless of who is in power here or there, to ensure that this relationship continues to develop well,\" Scholz said.\nScholz said that although he believed Europe had a responsibility to ensure Ukraine has a good future as the country fights against a Russian invasion, any support from Germany should not come at the cost of German prosperity.\nSupport for Ukraine must not lead to cuts in pensions or care, he said.\nAt the same time, Scholz vowed that Ukraine would \"not be left alone.\"\nHis remarks are possibly a response to calls by parties such as the AfD, the Left Party and the Alliance Sarah Wagenknecht to reduce or completely cut\u00a0German military aid to Kyiv.\nTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a

            "content": "German Chancellor Olaf Scholz is seeking a vote of confidence, which he is expected to lose. Does such a move work as a path to restore political stability?\nGerman Chancellor Olaf Scholz is seeking a vote of confidence in the lower house of Parliament, the Bundestag, which he is expected to lose, triggering an\u00a0early general election.\nScholz's three-way center-left government broke apart on November 6, paving the way for an early federal election\u00a0expected on\u00a0February 23, 2025.\nEarly elections have been extremely rare in Germany, but they are a vital democratic measure. They are regulated by the German constitution and require the approval of several constitutional bodies, not least of the head of state, the president.\nAccording to the German constitution, a decision to hold an early federal election\u00a0cannot be made by the members of the Bundestag, nor by the chancellor. An early dissolution of parliament can only come about in one of two ways.\nIn the first case, if a candidate for chancellor does not win an absolute parliamentary majority \u2014 at least 367 votes in the 733-seat Bundestag \u2014 the German president can dissolve the parliament. This has never happened in the history of the Federal Republic of Germany.\nTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video\nIn the second case, a chancellor can call for a vote of confidence in the Bundestag to confirm whether he or she still has sufficient parliamentary support. If the chancellor fails to win a majority, he or she can formally ask the president to dissolve the Bundestag within 21 days.\nFollowing the dissolution of parliament, an election\u00a0must be held within 60 days. They are organized in the same way as normal general elections, with the federal returning officer and the Federal Interior Ministry responsible for their implementation.\nThree early Bundestag elections have been held to date in the Federal Republic of Germany: in 1972, 1983 and 2005.\nWilly Brandt, the first chancellor from the center-left Social Democratic Party (SPD), governed in a coalition with the neoliberal Free Democratic Party (FDP)\u00a0beginning in 1969. His \"Ostpolitik\" (politics toward the East) led to a vote of confidence in 1972.\nBrandt had pushed ahead with his policy of rapprochement during the Cold War to ease relations with the socialist Eastern European bloc, a\u00a0highly controversial move in West Germany. Major splits emerged within the government, causing several SPD and FDP Bundestag lawmakers to quit. The government's majority was dramatically reduced, and Brandt's support fell to parity with the opposition conservatives, the Christian Democratic Union (CDU) and the regional Bavarian Christian Socialist Union (CSU): each side had 248 representatives in the Bundestag.\nThat stalemate paralyzed proceedings, so Brandt sought a solution. On June 24, 1972, he stated that \"the citizens\" had a \"right to ensure that legislation does not come to a standstill.\" He also said there was a growing danger \"that the opposition will fundamentally refuse to cooperate constructively. Therefore, I am\u00a0announcing that we are seeking new elections.\"\nBrandt called for a vote of confidence in the Bundestag with the aim of losing it, so that his chancellorship could be reconfirmed by voters in fresh elections. This move was fiercely criticized, also by constitutional lawyers who argued that deliberately losing a vote of confidence was not consistent with the spirit of the constitution, the Basic Law.\nBrandt stuck to his plan and called a vote of confidence on September 20, 1972 \u2014 and lost, as he had planned. That set the path for the Bundestag's dissolution and a\u00a0new election, which was held on November 19, 1972.\nBrandt was reelected as chancellor, and the SPD received 45.8% of the vote \u2014 its best result to date. Voter turnout was the highest ever for a Bundestag election, at 91.1%.\nHelmut Kohl, of the CDU, was responsible for the second early Bundestag election, in 1983. Kohl assumed power following a constructive vote of confidence in the then Chancellor Helmut Schmidt (SPD), in October 1982. The majority of parliamentarians had withdrawn their confidence in Schmidt due to differences over his economic and security policy.\nBecause Kohl's coalition of the CDU/CSU and FDP came to power through a vote of confidence and not a general election, Kohl wished for additional legitimacy through a general election. He called for a vote of confidence, which he, too, deliberately lost on December 17, 1982, resulting\u00a0in the dissolution of the Bundestag. Kohl said at the time, \"I opened the way to new elections in order to stabilize the government and obtain a clear majority in the Bundestag.\"\nSome Bundestag members found that unacceptable and filed a complaint with the Federal Constitutional Court. After 41 days of hearings, the Karlsruhe judges approved Kohl's path to a new election\u00a0by a deliberate vote of no confidence. However, they emphasized that a vote of confidence was only permissible during a \"genuine\" crisis.\nThe subsequent election\u00a0held on March 6, 1983, confirmed Kohl as chancellor, and his government was able to carry on with a clear majority.\nThe\u00a0SPD's\u00a0Gerhard Schr\u00f6der initiated Germany's third early election\u00a0in 2005. He was\u00a0chancellor at the time,\u00a0heading\u00a0a coalition with the Greens.\nThe SPD was struggling after a series of state election defeats and declining support in the Bundestag. The dwindling support was mostly due to Schr\u00f6der's controversial Agenda 2010 reforms, which had drastically changed the social system and the labor market. Schr\u00f6der called for a vote of confidence, which he deliberately lost on July 1, 2005, thus triggering a new election.\n\"I am firmly convinced that the majority of Germans want me to continue along this path. But I can only gain the necessary clarity only through a new election,\" Schr\u00f6der said after the vote.\nBut his calculation went afoul. The early election, held on September 18, 2005, gave Angela Merkel's CDU/CSU a narrow majority. She\u00a0became chancellor, heading a CDU/CSU-led\u00a0coalition supported by the SPD. That was the start of 16 years in office for Merkel.\nThis article was originally written in German.

            "content": "Despite poor approval ratings, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz will run again as the Social Democrats' top candidate in the 2025 federal elections. Why did the German government become so unpopular during his tenure?\nIn September, Olaf Scholz brushed aside a journalist's question about his legacy.\n\"I think you should be wary of politicians who think about that before their term in office has ended,\" he told Berlin's Tagesspiegel\u00a0newspaper in response to the question of what he hoped would one day be written in the history books about his time in office.\nTwo months later, following the collapse of his center-left three-way coalition, he may be beginning to ponder that\u00a0question. So far, the leadership of the center-left Social Democratic Party (SPD) is publicly demonstrating support for Scholz as their top candidate for the upcoming election on February 23, 2025. But with Scholz's low popularity ratings and the election campaign already heating up, calls in the party came up to\u00a0replace Scholz with 64-year-old Defense Minister Boris Pistorius, who has been Germany's\u00a0most popular politician in polls for months.\nIf,\u00a0as predicted,\u00a0the center-right bloc of the\u00a0Christian Democratic Union (CDU) and the\u00a0Christian Social Union (CSU) takes over the chancellorship, Scholz will have had the shortest term of office of any of the four\u00a0chancellors of the SPD in the history of the Federal Republic of Germany.\nBut Scholz is determined to win. In view of the current polls, which show the SPD only half as strong as the CDU/CSU, this is will be a real challenge.\nHaving said that, Scholz has never lacked self-confidence. Even in seemingly hopeless situations, he has always fervently believed he had everything under control. Critics have accused him of having a distorted perception of reality in such moments.\n\"You obviously live in your own cosmos, in your own world,\" said CDU leader Friedrich Merz in response to Scholz's upbeat speech in parliament a week after his coalition collapsed. \"You have not understood what is happening out there in the country at the moment.\"\nScholz's political career has been marked by ups and downs. His chancellorship faced several major challenges following Russia's invasion of Ukraine and Germany's tightrope walk of supporting Ukraine militarily without being drawn into the war itself.\nThe resulting energy crisis, inflation, the economic slump, the European asylum dispute and the unprecedented postwar electoral success of the far right \u2014 the federal government has had to deal with an extraordinary multitude of\u00a0problems under Scholz.\nTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video\nHis coalition government, named the \"traffic light\" coalition after the three parties' colors \u2014 SPD (red), neoliberal Free Democrats (FDP) (yellow) and environmentalist Greens \u2014 was an alliance full of political contradictions. It was a self-proclaimed \"progressive coalition\" formed after the 2021 general election, but the differences between party programs could not be bridged for long. After months of public bickering and backstabbing, it had become the most unpopular German government since the end of World War II.\nScholz, however, seems unfazed, pointing to the 2021 election campaign when he managed to buck the trend and win. Three months before the general election, victory for the SPD seemed impossible. The party was far behind in the polls, but Scholz was undeterred, saying again and again: \"I will become the chancellor.\"\nHis stoic optimism earned him much ridicule at the time, but one month before the vote, CDU candidate Armin Laschet made one mistake too many, and the SPD emerged the surprise winners garnering 25.7% of the vote, 1% ahead of the conservatives.\nFor Scholz, the 2021 win was the pinnacle of his decadeslong political career. He joined the SPD as a schoolboy in 1975. Before he entered the Bundestag in 1998, he ran his own law firm in Hamburg, held office as Hamburg's senator of the interior, as labor minister in the first \"grand coalition\" of the SPD and CDU/CSU under Chancellor Angela Merkel.\nThen he was governing mayor of the city-state of Hamburg for many years. \"Whoever orders leadership from me, gets it,\" he famously said when he took office there in 2011. In 2018, he moved back to Berlin as finance minister in another grand coalition under Merkel.\nFrom 2002 to 2004, Scholz served as SPD secretary general alongside Chancellor Gerhard Schr\u00f6der. It was during this time that the Hamburg weekly newspaper Die Zeit coined a phrase that stuck: \"Scholzomat\" \u2014 combining\u00a0\"Scholz\" and \"Automat\" to reflect Scholz's dispassionate manner and technocratic language, like a machine whose job it is to unflinchingly sell government policy, showing no emotion.\nIn the years since, Scholz has been unable to shake off the image of the boring and fun-free bureaucrat. He sees himself as a fact-oriented pragmatist who, rather than putting on a show,\u00a0only says as much as is absolutely necessary, while working quietly and efficiently.\nThat strategy worked well for him during his time as finance minister, when he quickly provided billions in aid to companies affected by the shutdowns during the COVID-19 pandemic.\nHowever, he has failed to realize that the job of chancellor requires far more communication. Scholz has remained silent during the biggest of crises, rarely finding the right words, seeming\u00a0arrogant\u00a0and failing\u00a0to win the hearts and minds of the people. But even though many supporters have called on him\u00a0to change his style \u2014\u00a0to talk more, to become more approachable\u00a0and even show some emotion \u2014\u00a0Scholz has refused to adapt,\u00a0simply letting criticism roll off his back.\nEven though the SPD executive is currently demonstratively in favor of Scholz as the top candidate, he has not yet been nominated. The official nomination of a top candidate is scheduled to happen at a party conference in January.\nThis article was originally written in German.

These\u00a0include\u00a0protecting the Constitutional Court, increasing child benefits\u00a0and tax cuts.\nScholz's words were aimed mostly at the center-right opposition bloc of the Christian Democratic Union (CDU) and its Bavarian sister party, the Christian Social Union (CSU), which \u2014 following the rupture of Scholz's coalition with the Free Democratic Party (FDP) \u2014 now holds most of the political power in the parliament.\nTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video\nFriedrich Merz, the leader of the CDU/CSU group (and effectively now chancellor-in-waiting), warned the chancellor that his party would not be the \"reserve players for your broken coalition.\" And yet, political observers note, there is scope for cooperation between the parties \u2014 and there are indeed one or two draft laws that Merz's party has an interest in passing before the Bundestag election set for\u00a0February 23, 2025.\nIn fact, one law was already passed on Thursday with the support of all the parties in the Bundestag,\u00a0except the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) and the socialist Left Party. But it was relatively minor \u2014 a law regulating the inheritance of farms \u2014 and it may prove to be an exception because cooperating with Scholz will be a tactical risk for the CDU in the impending election campaign.\nUrsula M\u00fcnch, director of the independent Tutzing Academy for Political Education, thinks the CDU will cooperate as little as possible with Scholz's minority government in the next few weeks.\n\"Even on measures that the CDU might consider worth striving for, it will always feel pressure not to improve Scholz's image,\" she told DW.\nMerz will also be keenly aware that any cooperation will leave him exposed to attacks from the far-right AfD\u00a0and the populist B\u00fcndnis Sahra Wagenknecht (BSW), who like to paint the CDU and SPD as indistinguishable parts of a mainstream \"cartel\" of the political classes.\nAs of now, only one of Scholz's big plans is certain to gain support from the CDU/CSU: the so-called \"AfD-proofing\" of the country's highest court.\nThis draft law, which CDU lawmakers helped to draw up, would ensure the number of judges (16), the judges' terms (12 years)\u00a0and their maximum age (68) are fixed in the German constitution. A separate draft law is also being formulated to create alternative paths to electing judges, should there be an impasse in the German parliament.\nThese laws would effectively prevent the AfD \u2014 or any party that wins more than a third of the seats in the Bundestag \u2014 from blocking the selection of new judges to the court or changing rules relating to it. Given that the AfD could potentially significantly increase its share of seats in the Bundestag in February, it is seen as vital to pass the law now.\nBut everything else Scholz had planned is up for discussion \u2014 and the CDU/CSU has already said it would only begin negotiating after Scholz triggers the next election by losing his vote of confidence on December 16.\nEffectively assured, for now, is Germany's support for Ukraine, since the SPD, the CDU\u00a0and the Greens agree that it is essential. However, the coalition government has failed to agree on a budget for 2025 \u2014\u00a0in fact, that's why it collapsed \u2014\u00a0which means that additional support for Ukraine has not yet been agreed, though existing orders will be unaffected. Scholz is hoping the CDU will agree to send more money sooner, though that is still up for discussion.\nAnother project that might find CDU support is finding extra packages to support Germany's ailing industrial sector. That was both a major theme of Merz's speech on Wednesday and of an \"industry summit\" that Scholz attended in October, when leading industry associations complained of the high energy costs in the country. Scholz wants to introduce caps on energy charges for the industry. Merz might well be on board for something along those lines, but only if he deems it so urgent that it can't wait until he is chancellor.\nTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video\nOne plan that does stand a chance of passing the Bundestag, whether or not it has CDU/CSU support, is the introduction of tax reductions to prevent \"bracket creep\" \u2014 when salary increases push earners into higher tax brackets leading to an effective drop in their net income. This can lead to decreased consumer spending and a so-called \"fiscal drag\" on the economy.\nThis tax relief was a demand of the Free Democrats, who are now expected to support the plan despite the acrimonious split. It is said to be worth \u20ac23 billion ($24 billion) \u2014 which could leave a hole in government finances.\nScholz is likely to have to say goodbye to many of his big plans. The pension reform, drawn up by the SPD-led Labor Ministry, would have meant keeping the pension level at 48% \u2014 the percentage of an average working income that a country's state pension provides in old age \u2014 until 2039.\nThe package also included the introduction of a share-based pension, intended to relieve the burden on the pension insurance system by using the income from a \u20ac200 billion\u00a0($210 billion) fund financed by loans and stock market investment. Both the CDU and the FDP have made clear that they would not support the move, on the grounds that keeping the pensions at a high level will disadvantage younger generations.\nAnother plan that now looks unlikely for the SPD to pass is a rise in child benefits from \u20ac250 to \u20ac255 a month. This will now probably have to wait for the approval of a 2025 budget in the next parliament. Theoretically, the Bundestag could introduce a law specifically to raise it, but, as M\u00fcnch put it, \"I don't see the CDU doing Scholz that favor.\"\nTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video\nCaught in a similar limbo is the Deutschlandticket, the Germany-wide ticket that allows travel on all local and regional transport for a fixed price. The government had already decided to continue the scheme but raise the price of this from \u20ac49 a month to \u20ac58, but its survival under a CDU/CSU-led government is far from assured.\nThe ticket is currently being subsidized jointly by the federal and state governments, but to extend the scheme will require a reform of that agreement \u2014 and some conservative-led states, like Bavaria, would like to see it scrapped altogether.\nEdited by: Rina Goldenberg\nWhile you're here: Every Tuesday, DW editors round up what is happening in German politics and society.

But the list ends there.\n\"Some decisions, Mr. Chancellor, that you might like to see will objectively not be possible at all since we will enter the next year without an approved federal budget.\"\nDuring the ensuing debate, during which all the parties fired off several broadsides against one another, it became clear that the coming election campaign would be key to determining Germany's direction.\nScholz once again asserted that his coalition had failed because of a row over finances. The SPD and the Greens had repeatedly called for the so-called \"debt brake\" to be reformed and unsuccessfully pushed the FDP to take on additional loans.\nTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video\nAccording to Scholz, the FDP had insisted on playing foreign, domestic, economic and social security policies against each other financially. He said he could not allow that.\n\"I will never ask people to choose between investing in our security or in good jobs and the economy and infrastructure,\" said Scholz. He added\u00a0that it was irresponsible to choose between either spending money on the Bundeswehr or secure pensions, or: \"Either we support Ukraine or we invest in Germany.\"\nMerz did not make any specific comments on how his conservatives\u00a0would deal with finances if they won the election. However, it's clear that a government led by him would want to spend less money on social welfare.\nThe CDU/CSU has also decided to roll back the Greens' energy policy.\u00a0\"We want to move away from the one-sided focus on wind and solar energy, e-mobility and heating systems using renewables,\" the CDU leader told lawmakers.\nMerz also sees a real need for change in other policy areas. \"Germany needs a fundamentally different policy, especially in migration policy, in foreign, security and European policy and in economic policy,\"\u00a0he said on Wednesday.\nTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video\nThe CDU/CSU are clearly ahead in the polls.

            "content": "One of three parties in Chancellor Olaf Scholz's governing coalition discussed plans to pull out two months before the government fell, German media have reported. Germany now faces a snap election in February 2025.\nGermany's neoliberal\u00a0Free Democratic Party (FDP)\u00a0plotted to collapse\u00a0Chancellor\u00a0Olaf Scholz's coalition government\u00a0two months before it fell apart, two German newspapers reported on Saturday.\nThe revelations come\u00a0as the country prepares for a snap election\u00a0in February, following the firing of FDP Finance Minister Christian Lindner\u00a0earlier this month. Lindner's widely reported plan to\u00a0lower\u00a0taxes, scrap\u00a0recent reforms and roll\u00a0back environment protection targets was deemed\u00a0a provocation by\u00a0his left-leaning coalition partners, and his party decided to\u00a0pull out of\u00a0the coalition. The coalition then collapsed\u00a0on November 6.\nHowever, the alliance between the FDP,\u00a0Scholz's center-left Social Democrats (SPD)\u00a0and the environmentally friendly Greens\u00a0had been unsteady for more than a year\u00a0due to ideological differences and disputes over the government budget.\nDie Zeit and S\u00fcddeutsche Zeitung\u00a0cited several sources as saying the FDP had drawn up a plan during secret talks in Potsdam in September to break away from the three-party coalition.\nLindner, who was fired by Scholz from his post\u00a0as finance minister after months of wrangling over the 2025 budget,\u00a0attended the talks, along with several other\u00a0FDP government ministers and\u00a0officials in the party's parliamentary faction, Die Zeit reported.\nTop of the agenda, according to the newspapers, was the future of the German coalition government and the future of the FDP.\nDie Zeit said what was discussed over the next few hours was \"the beginning of the end of the traffic light government,\" referring to the colors of the three parties: green, red, and yellow. The\u00a0FDP officials reportedly\u00a0drew up the first outlines of \"the\u00a0script for the overthrow of the government,\" known internally as\u00a0the \"D-Day\u00a0project.\"\nThe original D-Day marked the landing of Allied\u00a0troops in Normandy, France\u00a0in June\u00a01944, marking the beginning of the end of World War II and Germany's then-Nazi regime.\nTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video\nSeveral scenarios were\u00a0reportedly developed by the party's top leadership over the next two months, who eventually produced\u00a0a detailed\u00a0plan to exit\u00a0the coalition.\nDie Zeit said an economic policy paper was even drawn up, which the party knew would be unacceptable to the other coalition partners, who had been wracked by months of infighting.\nA timetable for the withdrawal of FDP ministers from the Cabinet was also discussed, the newspaper reported.\nThe FDP was at the time polling below 5%, a crucial threshold for any party to enter the lower house of parliament, the Bundestag.\nParty officials were also concerned the FDP could disappear into obscurity for the second time in a decade. Between 2009 and 2013, the party was a part of former Chancellor Angela Merkel's coalition, but then dropped below the 5% threshold and was left without seats in the national parliament.\nAccording to Die Zeit, Lindner made\u00a0it clear that he saw no hope for the\u00a0party if it remained\u00a0in government.\nResponding to the revelations, an\u00a0FDP spokesperson told DPA news agency:\u00a0\"We do not comment on internal meetings.\"\nThe spokesman added that assessments about the party's future in the coalition had taken place\u00a0\"repeatedly and in various rounds,\" ever since Germany's\u00a0Constitutional Court declared the coalition's 2021 supplementary budget\u00a0unconstitutional last November.\nThe supplementary budget was designed so Scholz's government could\u00a0move \u20ac60 billion ($63.25 billion) in unused COVID pandemic recovery funds\u00a0to bolster its climate and infrastructure investments.\n\"Of course, scenarios were considered again and again and opinions were gathered,\" the FDP\u00a0spokesman said.\nThe spokesman continued that Lindner had proposed two options to Scholz at\u00a0a meeting earlier this month.\nThese were \"an agreement on a realignment of economic policy or the orderly termination of the coalition through a joint path to new elections,\" he added.\nTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video\nAfter Lindner was dismissed on November 6, the same day Donald Trump was reelected as\u00a0US president, two of the three remaining FDP ministers in the federal government walked out, while another quit the party.\nThis left Scholz leading\u00a0a minority government, prompting calls for a\u00a0confidence vote in the government and an early election.\nAhead of February's likely federal vote, most pollsters are already predicting\u00a0a grand coalition between center-right CDU/CSU \u2014 Merkel's former alliance\u00a0\u2014 and Scholz's SPD as\u00a0likely.\nThe FDP is currently polling at 4%, according to a survey published Saturday by the INSA polling institute for Germany's largest mass circulation daily, Bild.\nmm/dj (DPA, Die Zeit)\nWhile you're here: Every Tuesday, DW editors round up what is happening in German politics and society.

            "content": "Germans will head to the polls early next year after the coalition led by Chancellor Olaf Scholz collapsed.\nBerlin, Germany \u2013 In some countries, a snap election is held in a matter of weeks.\nGermany, by contrast, will enjoy a leisurely three months before it goes to the polls in an election that is likely to be overshadowed by the return of Donald Trump to the White House, an increasingly perilous situation in Ukraine, and a flagging domestic economy.\n\n\n\n\nGermany\u2019s ruling \u201ctraffic light\u201d coalition, formed by the Social Democratic Party (SPD), Greens and Free Democrats (FDP) collapsed on November 6, after Chancellor Olaf Scholz dismissed his finance minister, FDP leader Christian Lindner.\nScholz has announced a vote of confidence will take place on December 16. The snap poll is expected to take place on February 23.\nThe three-way alliance formed after the 2021 elections was a rarity for Germany, and the FDP\u2019s fiscal hawkishness always made an uneasy marriage with its centre-left partners, who campaigned in the 2021 elections on increased social and climate spending.\nThe final break came during preparations for the 2025 budget, with Scholz arguing to pause Germany\u2019s \u201cdebt brake\u201d, which tightly limits public borrowing. Lindner insisted on demanding major public spending cuts and rolling back climate targets.\nLast week in the Bundestag, Scholz accused the FDP leader of pitting the government\u2019s financial and military support for Ukraine against German pensioners.\nThe national weekly newspaper Die Zeit reported that the FDP had deliberately provoked Scholz to collapse the coalition and force an early election, which the party has denied.\n\u201cIt was difficult to reconcile those three very different political ideas and ideologies,\u201d said Markus Ziener, a senior fellow at the German Marshall Fund think tank, who believes infighting has weakened Germany\u2019s position within the European Union at a time when the bloc is sorely in need of leadership.\n\u201cThe hope could be that the next elections will bring much more stable conditions to form a reliable government.\u201d\nThe Christian Democratic Union (CDU) and its Bavarian sister party are currently polling at 32 percent, according to a recent INSA poll, more than all three of the coalition parties put together.\nFriedrich Merz, a former BlackRock board member who has moved the party rightward since becoming leader in 2022, is therefore well-placed to become the next chancellor.\nBased on current polling, he could lead a government with the SPD \u2013 based on the latest predictions likely to secure 16 percent, as a junior partner, a return to the familiar \u201cgrand coalition\u201d that was in place for three of Angela Merkel\u2019s four terms, or with the Greens, which are polling at 12 percent.\nMerz has promised to roll back several of the coalition\u2019s reforms, including on climate. He wants to lower taxes, reduce social welfare spending and tighten the country\u2019s borders.\n\u201cIt is time for a fundamental course correction in migration, security, foreign and economic policy,\u201d Merz told the Bundestag last week.\nScholz, now the least popular chancellor in post-war German history according to polls, has indicated that he will run again as the party\u2019s candidate.\nBut many senior figures in the SPD want to make a clear break with his tenure, and quickly. If he is to be deposed, Defence Minister Boris Pistorius is likely to replace him.\nThe far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) is on course to record a historic result.\nAssessments from Germany\u2019s domestic intelligence agency that several of the party\u2019s state branches are right-wing extremist organisations have not prevented the party from polling second, at 20 percent.\nThough all other parties refuse to form a coalition with the AfD, a strong performance could increase its influence on powerful parliamentary committees.\nMeanwhile, the FDP and the socialist Left party are currently below the 5 percent threshold required to enter parliament. The newly formed, left-wing Sahra Wagenknecht Alliance is at 7 percent.\nTrump\u2019s campaign promise to bring a quick end to the conflict in Ukraine, and threats to pull military assistance to President Volodymr Zelenskyy\u2019s government, come at a time when the war-torn nation is losing ground to Russia in the east and facing major attacks on its energy infrastructure ahead of winter.\nIf Trump follows through, Germany, Ukraine\u2019s second-largest backer, will be expected to dig deep and massively increase its military spending.\nScholz recently spoke with Russian President Vladimir Putin for the first time in two years. He tends to tread a more careful approach and has refused to deliver long-range Taurus missiles out of fears of escalating the conflict.\nBy comparison, Merz has been more hawkish on weapons deliveries and indicated he would approve the transfer, in line with the policies of the United Kingdom, France and the United States.\nPotentially adding further strain to the budget, Trump\u2019s plans to slap 20 percent tariffs on all imports and 60 percent on Chinese imports would have severe consequences for the economy, as Germany remains heavily reliant on exporting manufactured goods.\nEurope\u2019s largest economy is also its slowest growing.\nThough it has narrowly skirted recession, Germany\u2019s central bank said on Tuesday that the present stagnation is likely to continue in the face of weak international demand and investment, and the prospect of new US tariffs.\n\u201cWe\u2019re basically in a squeeze here. On the one hand, we probably have to deal with direct additional customs in the United States,\u201d said Ziener.\n\u201cOn the other hand, we will probably be very much affected by high duties against Chinese products.\u201d\nWith no end in sight to the economic woes, more financial institutions and business representatives are calling for a reform of Germany\u2019s debt brake to increase public investment, which has lagged for years.\nMerz, long known as a fiscal disciplinarian, has recently suggested an openness to reforming it, a possible sign of a shifting consensus.\nThe constitutional-anchored measure limits borrowing to 0.35 percent of gross domestic product (GDP), but special investment off-budget funds worth hundreds of billions have been used to circumvent it.\nDezernat Zukunft, a research institute that advocates for reform of the debt brake, estimates that Germany requires public spending of $782bn before 2030, which it says can be achieved without constitutional amendments.\n\u201cThe deeper question is whether there\u2019s a political majority for debt finance in Germany,\u201d said Max Krahe, director of research at Dezernat Zukunft, a research institute that campaigns for reform of the debt brake.\n\u201cTo say, yes, we are willing to use debt as a financing instrument to tackle all the problems in front of us, whether it\u2019s defence, decarbonisation, infrastructure, competitiveness, education, healthcare.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFollow Al Jazeera English:",

Whoever votes for Merz \"is voting for war,\" the far-right lawmaker said.\nShe also demanded that refugees from the war in Syria be sent home immediately, despite the continued uncertainty in the Middle Eastern country.\nIf German lawmakers decide to withdraw their support from Scholz, he will ask President Frank-Walter Steinmeier to dissolve parliament and call for early elections about seven months sooner than planned.\nTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video\nIn his speech before the Bundestag, former Finance Minister Christian Lindner took\u00a0the opportunity to attack\u00a0the economic policies\u00a0of the German chancellor.\nIn particular, the reduction in VAT on foodstuffs proposed by Scholz is unnecessary, the leader of the business-focused Free Democrats said.\nSuch a step would cost billions of euros but would not secure or create any jobs, he said.\n\"Prince Carnival may hand out candy on Rose\u00a0Monday, but the Federal Republic of Germany must not be governed like this,\" said Lindner, likening the measure\u00a0to a\u00a0German tradition of candy being thrown to crowds from procession floats on the last Monday before Lent.\nLindner said Germany was in a worsening economic crisis and called for a political turnaround to prevent further economic decline.\n\"We must be honest and tell the citizens: Never in history has a society defended its prosperity, its social security and its sense of ecological responsibility by making less effort, by working less, by coming up with fewer ideas and by being less willing to take entrepreneurial risks,\" said Lindner.\nRobert Habeck, Green vice chancellor and economy minister, took the podium shortly after opposition leader Merz called him the \"face of the economic crisis\" in Germany.\nHabeck pointed to other countries in Europe that are currently without a government or being governed by shaky coalitions: France, Belgium, Austria, and the Netherlands. He said this highlighted not only that Germany needed to cease navel-gazing, but that \"a new vote is not a guarantee that a new government will quietly and quickly get to work.\"\nLike Scholz, he blamed the FDP for \"being part of a government while simultaneously trying to destroy it.\"\nHabeck said that Germany needed a government that was \"ready to make compromises,\" which the current coalition did successfully for three years until the FDP decided to sabotage it.\nHe then slammed Merz's accusations that the SPD-led coalition had tanked the economy, citing the effects of the war in Ukraine and how the CDU under former Chancellor Angela Merkel had left Germany reliant on cheap Russian gas.\nThe vice chancellor called Merkels' decision a \"grand historical mistake.\" Energy prices have soared in Germany as the country moved to pivot away from Russian gas quickly in the aftermath of the invasion of Ukraine.\nAlluding mainly to the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD), Habeck said that the \"racism\" of the right-wing in Germany was \"the biggest threat\" to the national economy, because it was keeping skilled migrants away.\nThe leader of the opposition CDU Friedrich Merz accused the ruling coalition of hypocrisy. He\u00a0spoke ahead of a confidence vote over Chancellor Olaf Scholz's government.\n\"The chancellor spoke a lot about respect, but it seems as though his respect ends where other political opinions begin,\" he said, before calling it \"shameless\" to have spoken so highly of his accomplishments but so badly of the FDP, who he said helped him achieve\u00a0all of them.\nHe further asked why, if Scholz foresaw so much room for progress, the SPD hadn't accomplished any of it \"in the 22 years of the last 26\" when it was part of Germany's governing coalitions.\n\"Where were you for the last 22 years?\" he asked.\nMerz went on to criticize the funding of the military, the reaction to record-high inflation and an economic crisis, and Scholz's perceived lack of clarity and outspokenness on global issues over the last several years.\n\"You have brought shame on Germany\" in front of the EU and other allies, Merz said.\nHe also praised the FDP for what he described as trying to prevent the ruling SPD and Greens from raising taxes. Arguments over the national budget played a major role over the collapse of Scholz's coalition.\nReturning to the topic of the economy, Merz also implied that Germans do not work enough, citing neighboring Switzerland as a positive example, where people \"work on average 200 hours more\" a year. The conservative leader said that working more hours was necessary for \"making Germany more competitive.\"\nThese statements were met with loud consternation by other lawmakers.\nThe beginning of Chancellor Olaf Scholz's speech felt like the official kick-off of the election campaign.\nThe political groups in the Bundestag had rallied their troops and coordinated their planned applause for this special session. During Scholz\u2019s address, there was consistent applause only from his SPD group and individual members of the Greens, who form part of his government.\nThe business-friendly FDP, most of whose ministers were ousted by Scholz, kept their hands firmly on their desks.\nScholz highlighted many of Germany\u2019s current weaknesses. Observers on the visitors\u2019 benches made cynical comments, such as \u201cWait till he finds out who\u2019s in charge.\u201d\nWhen Scholz\u2019s strongest opponent, Friedrich Merz of the CDU, took the stage, the applause came from the other side of the plenary, mostly from the CDU/CSU. Judging by their clapping, many in the FDP still hope to form the next governing coalition with the Conservatives. Small caveat: They will need to get enough votes on February 23rd to make it into parliament first.\n\nDuring his speech in the Bundestag ahead of a confidence motion, Chancellor Olaf Scholz called for the value-added tax (VAT)\u00a0rate on food products to drop from 7% to 5% amid the country's cost of living crisis.\nHe said that he wanted to raise Germany's minimum wage to \u20ac15 ($15.75).\n\"The world did not end when we introduced the minimum wage or when we raised it to \u20ac12,\" he said.\nScholz also called for the availability of daycare facilities to be greater so that more women could work full-time.\nHe pointed to Germany's labor shortage, calling for \"more workers\" and \"more productivity.\"\nScholz said that there was no way to plug the labor shortage without migration.\nHe praised his coalition government's citizenship reform, which allowed for dual\u00a0citizenship and faster naturalization.\n\"One in four of us has a migrant background,\" Scholz said. \"We all make up Germany.\"\nTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video\nChancellor Scholz said Germany needed \"massive investment\" to meet the future, particularly for self-defense.\n\"Today a highly armed nuclear power is waging war in Europe just two hours' flight from here. We must invest massively in our security and defense,\" he said, referencing Russia's invasion of Ukraine.\nAt the same time, he said, he would never \"send German soldiers into that war,\" and not further inflame the conflict, likely a reference to rival Friedrich Merz's desire to send German Taurus missiles to Ukraine should his CDU emerge victorious in February's vote.\nHowever, Scholz said, Germany\u00a0would remain \"Ukraine's strongest supporter in Europe...supporting Ukrainian sovereignty and ending all the death,\" that has come out of the conflict.",

But he added that it would take more than one legislative period to close the gap on 30 years of underfunding.\nOn Wednesday, the German Navy got key approval to expand its fleet with an order for four more advanced\u00a0submarines, in a deal with\u00a0ThyssenKrupp Marine Systems (TKMS) costing about \u20ac4.7 billion.\nAlso this week, Pistorius said Berlin plans to\u00a0increase the size of its armed forces to 230,000, up from the current target of 203,000.\nHowever,\u00a0the minister told Funke newspapers that Germany's defense sector \"needs time to ramp up production capacities to produce weapons and ammunition,\" as the production of tanks, frigates and submarines can take several years.\nSeparately, a poll for Bild am Sonntag newspaper placed\u00a0Pistorius up top in an annual ranking of German politicians.\nAround\u00a046% of those surveyed by Insa said they thought\u00a0the defense minister\u00a0should have as much influence as possible in German politics next year.\nBavaria's conservative state Premier\u00a0Markus S\u00f6der (CSU) scored 38% on the same question, while Scholz was beaten into sixth place with 28% support.\nScholz came in\u00a0behind\u00a0BSW chief\u00a0Wagenknecht, center-right\u00a0CDU leader Friedrich Merz and AfD co-chair\u00a0Alice Weidel.\nmm/sms (dpa, Reuters)",

The center-right CDU/CSU proposes tax cuts and plans to allow tax-free earnings for pensioners. The SPD seeks to reform the debt brake for infrastructure investment and proposes a wealth tax. The Greens and FDP also advocate for pension reforms and reducing bureaucracy. The far-right AfD calls for EU withdrawal and strict border controls. All parties will finalize their manifestos in early 2024 before a heated campaign leading to the election.",
            "content": "Germany's political parties have begun presenting their draft election manifestos ahead of the snap election in February 2025. They focus on income, the economy and jobs.\nGermany's center-right bloc of Christian Democratic Union (CDU) and its Bavarian sister party Christian Social Union (CSU) has unanimously voted in favor of an election program that promises to lower taxes and stop illegal migration.\nThe CDU/CSU wants to reduce income tax and gradually lower taxes for companies to 25%. It promises not to cut old age pensions and plans to encourage those who want to continue working beyond retirement age of 67, allowing them to earn up to \u20ac2,000 ($2,100) per month tax-free on top of their pension.\nThe problem: The bold ideas of CDU chancellor candidate Friedrich Merz will cost billions of euros, and will be extremely hard to implement\u00a0if the CDU/CSU refuses to ease the \"debt brake.\" Enshrined in\u00a0\u00a0Germany's Basic Law, the brake limits fresh debt to a maximum of 0.35% of economic output (GDP).\nAlthough he himself is not popular with the electorate, Merz's party is currently significantly ahead in opinion polls, and he has a good chance of becoming the next chancellor after the snap election on February 23.\nTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video\nThe Social Democrats (SPD) want to reform the debt brake in order to make billions of euros available for urgently needed investments, for example in the ailing infrastructure. The party is also focusing on tax incentives for companies hoping to increase investment.\nIn line with its message to low-income voters, the SPD wants the super-rich with assets of more than \u20ac100 million to pay a wealth tax. In the Bundestag this week, Chancellor Olaf Scholz announced that he would raise the statutory minimum wage once again: \"In the last election campaign, I promised a minimum wage of \u20ac12, and I have kept that promise. That's why I'm fighting for a \u20ac15 minimum wage in the next federal election.\"\nIn the past three years of government, the Greens have been facing criticism over their climate protection plans. Now the party has scaled back its demands to reduce greenhouse gases compared to the 2021 election campaign.\nThe Greens also want to reform the debt brake, introduce subsidies for electric cars, and propose a new \"citizens' fund\" to secure pensions. This fund should also be fed with state money. And they want a billionaire's tax, as vice-chancellor and leading candidate Robert Habeck said in an interview with the tabloid Bild.\nAccording to expert estimates, there are currently 249 billionaires in Germany: \"If you taxed a small proportion of their wealth, you would have around five to six billion euros,\" was Habeck's calculation. He said this money could be invested in education.\nLike the Greens, the Free Democratic Party (FDP) is also calling for a reform of pensions. Party leader Christian Lindner is campaigning for the introduction of a share-based pension. The FDP's demands for a fundamentally different economic policy were the main reason for the break-up of the coalition government with SPD and the Greens in November.\nMany of those demands have now appeared in the party's election program: Easing the tax burden on companies with high energy prices, and less bureaucracy.\nThe socialist Left Party wants to introduce higher taxes for the wealthy, including an inheritance tax of 60% for those with an inheritance of \u20ac3 million or more.\nThe Left Party also wants to raise the minimum wage to \u20ac15 and pensions to 53% (from currently 48%) of the recipient's net income. It wants to boost public transport to make sure there is at least an hourly bus and train service for rural areas, and to ban flights that are shorter than 500 kilometers or five hours by train.\nAccording to its draft election manifesto, the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) wants Germany to leave the EU and abolish the euro. It denies the existence of man-made climate change and advocates setting up new coal-fired power plants and nuclear power stations, and to resume the import of Russian natural gas.\nThe AfD\u00a0also wants even tougher border controls that push back refugees who have traveled through other EU countries to get to Germany. They even want to detain asylum-seekers at the border while their applications are processed.\nThe CDU/CSU is also in favor of turning back refugees at the borders. Following the fall of Syrian ruler Bashar Assad, CDU chancellor candidate Merz does not want to allow any more people from Syria to come to Germany. The SPD, FDP and Greens also agree to a more consistent deportation of asylum seekers who have committed crimes.\nChancellor Olaf Scholz wants to address voter concerns about the war in Ukraine. His SPD has vowed to continue to support Ukraine but does not want to supply long-range missiles that could reach targets in Russia. However, this is precisely what Merz has repeatedly spoken out in favor of in recent months.\nAll the parties will vote on their draft manifestos at special party conferences in the New Year. This will be followed by a short and certainly heated campaign until the election on February 23.\nThis article was originally written in German.\nTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video\nWhile you're here: Every Tuesday, DW editors round up what is happening in German politics and society.

The coalition's failure was largely due to disagreements over fiscal policy, with tensions between the SDP, Greens, and the liberal Free Democratic Party (FDP). The rise of the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) complicates future coalition possibilities, signaling a fragmented political landscape.",
            "content": "Olaf Scholz has been Germany's chancellor since 2021\nGerman Chancellor Olaf Scholz has lost a vote of confidence in parliament, paving the way for early elections on 23 February.\nScholz called Monday's vote and had expected to lose it, but calculated that triggering an early election was his best chance of reviving his party's political fortunes.\nIt comes around two months after the collapse of Scholz's three-party coalition government, which left the embattled chancellor leading a minority administration.\nAhead of Monday's vote, Scholz said it would now be up to voters to \"determine the political course of our country\", teeing up what is likely to be a fiercely fought election campaign.\nLosing Monday's no-confidence vote was the outcome Scholz had wanted.\nThanks to the loss, elections can now happen in February, rather than in September as originally scheduled.\nThere were 207 MPs, mainly from his own party, who voted for Scholz, while 394 voted against him and 116 abstained.\nSince Scholz's argumentative three-party governing coalition collapsed in November, he had been reliant on support from the opposition conservatives to pass any new laws, effectively rendering his administration a lame-duck government.\nGiven Germany's stalled economy and the global crises facing the West, staggering on until the scheduled election date of September 2025 risked being seen as irresponsible by the electorate.\nScholz's Social Democratic Party (SDP) is trailing heavily in opinion polls, while the conservative Christian Democratic Union (CDU) under Friedrich Merz appears to be on course for a return to government.\nOpening the debate ahead of Monday's vote, Scholz said the snap election was an opportunity to set a new course for the country and called for \"massive\" investment, particularly in defence, while Merz said more debt would be a burden for younger generations and promised tax cuts.\nScholz's decision to stage a vote he expected to lose in order to dissolve his own government was described as a \"kamikaze\" move by the German tabloid Bild - but it is generally the only way a German government can dissolve parliament and spark early elections.\nThe process was designed specifically by the post-war founders of modern Germany to avoid the political instability of the Weimar era.\nThis vote of confidence is not a political crisis in itself: it is a standard constitutional mechanism that has been used by modern German chancellors five times to overcome political stalemate - and one Gerhard Schr\u00c3\u00b6der deployed on two occasions.\nHowever, there is a deeper problem within German politics.\nOn the surface, the collapse of the coalition was sparked by a row over money. Scholz's centre-left SDP and his Green partners wanted to ease Germany's strict debt rules to finance support for Ukraine and key infrastructure projects.\nThat was blocked by Scholz's own finance minister, Christian Lindner, who is the leader of the business-friendly liberal Free Democratic Party (FDP), which prioritised driving down the debt.\nLindner was sacked and the coalition collapsed. After years of unedifying bickering, you could almost hear the sigh of relief in Berlin's corridors of power - but the underlying cause is more difficult to resolve and more worrying.\nGermany's party political system has become more fragmented, with more parties than ever in parliament. The new upstart political forces are also more radical.\nIn 2017, the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) entered the Bundestag for the first time, winning 12.6%.\nIn 2021, it slipped to 10.4%, but is now polling at almost 20%.\nGermany engulfed by political crisis as Scholz coalition falls apart\nGermany plans February election after coalition collapse\nThe AfD will not get into government because no-one will work with it to form a coalition. But the far-right is eating into the share of the vote that goes to the two centrist big-tent parties which have always put forward modern German chancellors.\nThe bigger the AfD share is, the more difficult it becomes for mainstream parties to form a stable governing coalition.\nThat was arguably the underlying problem that pulled apart Scholz's fractious coalition: big-spending left-leaning Social Democrats and Greens trying to work with free-market small-state liberals.\nRather than going away after the next election in February, that problem is likely to get worse. If the far-right wins a fifth of seats in parliament, it could be even more difficult after February to form a stable coalition between like-minded parties.\nAnother new populist political party could also get into parliament for the first time, the anti-migrant nativist far-left Sahra Wagenknecht Alliance BSW, which is named after its firebrand leader, who joined the East German Communist party shortly before the fall of the Berlin Wall.\nThe conservatives are leading in the polls, but as things stand their options for coalition partners are limited.\nThey refuse to work with the far-right and it is hard to imagine they would like to work with the radical left either. The free-market liberals may not even get into parliament, and some conservatives refuse to consider the Greens.\nThat leaves Scholz's SDP as a possible partner - even though Scholz is likely to be ousted from power after his stint in power saw his popularity plummet.\nWhatever the next government looks like, the era of cosy consensual coalitions in Germany seems to be over.\nLocals find homes reduced to ash as fears grow of more fierce winds spreading LA fires\nClimate 'whiplash' linked to raging LA fires\nWatch: The moment five US presidents gather at Jimmy Carter's funeral\nThe '9/11 mastermind' is set to plead guilty.

            "content": "After collapse of Olaf Scholz\u2019s coalition, elections will take place on February 23, seven months ahead of schedule.\nGerman Chancellor Olaf Scholz has lost a confidence vote in parliament, triggering snap elections seven months ahead of schedule.\nThe vote on Monday came after Scholz\u2019s fragile coalition collapsed, sparking a political crisis in the European Union\u2019s largest economy.\n\n\n\n\nScholz won the support of 207 lawmakers in the 733-seat lower house, or Bundestag, while 394 members voted against him and 116 abstained. That left him far short of the majority of 367 needed to win.\nThe elections for a new parliament will take place on February 23.\nThe governing coalition, which had consisted of three political parties, was shaken when Scholz fired Finance Minister\u00a0Christian Lindner in November.\nLindner\u2019s pro-business Free Democrats then quit the coalition government, robbing Scholz of a majority in parliament.\nScholz\u2019s centre-left Social Democrats (SPD) and the Greens will continue running the country without parliamentary backing until a new government is formed.\nMonday\u2019s move came after months of infighting over fiscal priorities and debt spending.\nEarlier this month, a hung parliament in neighbouring France toppled the country\u2019s prime minister with no confidence vote.\nThe crisis in France prompted President Emanuel Macron to name centrist politician Francois Bayrou as new prime minister without triggering a new election. But it highlighted the intensifying political rifts in EU countries amid economic uncertainty and the war in Ukraine.\n\n\n\nIn Germany, Scholz \u2013 who previously served as mayor of Hamburg and finance minister before becoming the head of a new government in 2021 \u2013 accused the Free Democrats of wanting to block investment in the country.\nSeen as a continuity candidate when he took over from Angela Merkel three years ago, he hasframed next year\u2019s election as an opportunity for voters to set a new course, casting the vote as a choice between a future of growth versus one of austerity.\nIf he is given a second term, Scholz said he would invest heavily in Germany\u2019s creaking infrastructure and would not make the spending cuts he said the conservatives want.\nScholz and the leader of the conservative Christian Democratic Union, Friedrich Merz, who polls suggest is likely to be the next chancellor, clashed in a debate before Monday\u2019s vote, accusing each other of incompetence.\n\u201cShortsightedness might save money in the short term, but the mortgage on our future is unaffordable,\u201d Scholz told lawmakers.\nMerz told Scholz that his spending plans would burden future generations and accused the chancellor of failing to deliver on promises of rearmament since Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine.\nThe conservative leader has been a vocal backer of giving Ukraine German-made Taurus missiles, which could be used to strike targets inside Russia.\nScholz, by contrast, has refused to supply them to Kyiv, suggesting that such moves could plunge Berlin into a fiercer conflict with with Moscow.\nBoth Scholz and Merz are staunch supporters of Israel. Germany is one of the top suppliers of weapons to Israel, which has been accused by rights groups of carrying out a genocide in Gaza.\n\n\n\nAhead of the February vote, the conservatives have a comfortable, albeit narrowing lead of more than 10 percentage points over the SPD in most polls.\nThe far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) is slightly ahead of Scholz\u2019s party while the Greens are in fourth place.\nThe mainstream parties have refused to govern with the AfD, but its presence complicates parliamentary politics, making unwieldy three-way coalitions like Scholz\u2019s more likely.\nMeanwhile, the chancellor has outlined a list of urgent measures that he could pass before the elections, including 11 billion euros ($11.6bn) of tax cuts and an increase in child benefits.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFollow Al Jazeera English:",

            "content": "Follow:\nGermany, Europe\u2019s largest economy and normally a pillar of stability, is facing snap elections next year after Chancellor Olaf Scholz lost a vote of confidence.\nHis government collapsed in November in a budget dispute but his coalition had been unsteady for months.\nScholz lost the vote, which he called himself as a step toward securing an early national election, with 394 ballots against him, 207 in his favor and 116 abstentions.\nWith the election date set for February 23 next year, here\u2019s what\u2019s at stake.\nThere will be seven major parties for which Germans will vote. Four of the seven have made official announcements about their Kanzlerkandidaten \u2013 candidates for chancellor.\nThe ever-present two dominant parties of German politics, the Christian Democrats (CDU) and Christian Social Union (CSU), unofficially known as the Union, make up one grouping. The Social Democrats, or SPD, form another.\nGiven the German system of proportional representation, the government tends to be formed in a coalition, usually headed by the CDU/CSU or the SPD.\nThe winner looks for a partner to form a majority. Since 2021, Scholz\u2019s SPD had governed in an uneasy coalition with the liberal Free Democrats Party (FDP) and the Green Party. In the 16 years before Scholz\u2019s three-party coalition, the CDU, under Angela Merkel, had relied on both the SPD and the FDP as partners in different governments.\nRelated video\n\u2018Complete chaos\u2019: CNN reporter breaks down Germany\u2019s political crisis\nThe CDU/CSU this time around will be led by Friedrich Merz, and the SPD by the incumbent but deeply unpopular chancellor, Scholz.\nThe far-right Alternative for Deutschland party (AfD) has seen strong performances in regional elections give it a national boost. The party\u2019s co-leader, Alice Weidel, is its Kanzlerkandidat. She is known for slick talking and populist policies, particularly on migration. She\u2019s an ardent supporter of upholding traditional German values, famously saying \u201cno one touch my schnitzel!\u201d \u2013 a reference to the popular dish.\nThe Green Party should also be considered one to watch. It is unlikely to gather enough votes to be the biggest party, but nonetheless could play an important role in the formation of the next government. The Greens will be led by Robert Habeck, currently the nation\u2019s Economics Minister.\nThe three other major parties will be the Free Democrats; the BSW, a left-wing socialist group named after its leader, Sahra Wagenknecht; and lastly Die Linke, a left-wing political party. All three have yet to officially announce their candidates.\nBarring a major and unexpected reversal in the polls, Merz of the CDU/CSU is highly likely to be Germany\u2019s new chancellor.\nNational opinion polls currently have the CDU/CSU way out ahead of the others, with 32% of support from those surveyed. The AfD are currently polling in second place with 18%, the SPD in third with 16%, and the Greens with 14%.\nMerz is not a newcomer to German politics, but this is his second iteration as a politician.\nBetween 1989 and 1994, Merz was a member of the European Parliament (MEP) for Germany. He subsequently became a member of the Bundestag, or German parliament, representing the CDU there until 2009. He then left politics to work as a corporate lawyer, where he sat on many supervisory boards, including at investment giant BlackRock.\nMerz represents the constituency of Hochsauerlandkreis in the Bundestag, the region in which he was born, and currently lives in his hometown of Brilon. He is also widely reputed to be a millionaire and has a private pilot\u2019s license.\nMerz made two failed attempts to become CDU head in 2018 and 2020. In 2021 he returned as a member of the Bundestag, for the first time in 12 years, and subsequently went on to secure the nomination as head of the CDU, officially taking over in September 2022.\nRelated article\nZelensky accuses German chancellor of opening \u2018Pandora\u2019s box\u2019 with Putin\nHe is known for having shifted the CDU to the right, with a tougher stance on migration, and a strong economic mind. During his bid to become party leader, he campaigned on not being a Merkel-style heir, unlike his challengers, thus marking the end of the centrist policies of the CDU during her era as chancellor.\nLeonie von Randow, a political reporter at German broadcaster WELT TV who will be covering the election campaign, told CNN that Merz \u201cknows a thing or two about the economy, and that is obviously something that many people care about. Many people hope (he) can move things forward.\u201d\nMerz is a very strong proponent of backing Ukraine as it fights Russia\u2019s full-scale invasion. He has been a vocal supporter of giving Ukraine German-made Taurus missiles, weapons that could be used to attack Russian targets far beyond Ukraine\u2019s front lines. Scholz, by contrast, has consistently refused to supply them to Kyiv.\nMerz made a surprise trip to the Ukrainian capital earlier this month, where he urged European nations to form a \u201ccommon vision\u201d for peace in Ukraine, especially given the impending arrival of US President-elect Donald Trump in the White House.\nThe economy is going to play a central role in the election, particularly given its sluggish performance under Scholz.\nIn recent days the German Central Bank has revised down predicted growth forecasts by 0.2%, stating that \u201cthe German economy is set to stagnate in the winter half-year 2024-25 and only begins to make a slow recovery over the course of 2025.\u201d\nConnected to the debate on the economy will be a focus on reviving the country\u2019s important automotive industry. The Central Bank has said that problems within the industry are \u201cstructural,\u201d and are thus exacerbating the drag on the economy.\nMajor companies including Volkswagen, one of world\u2019s largest car manufacturers, are facing major layoffs and plant closures.\nArguments over immigration will also be critical in this election, particularly as parties look to lure votes away from a surging AfD, which has made it a core issue.\n\u201cThe election is probably coming at a very good time for the AfD\u2026 this is a moment when many people are generally very unhappy with the government, so they kind of want to make a point and vote for an extreme party to show how unhappy they are,\u201d von Randow told CNN.\nScholz reintroduced checks on borders with neighboring European nations in recent months, a move many saw as him trying to curry favor with voters who may be turning towards the populist AfD.\nThe collapse of the Assad regime in Syria will also play into the national debate. Germany took in more Syrian migrants than any other European nation during its civil war. Campaigning around how each party would handle immigrants has already started.\nIt is very hard to see an outcome where the CDU/CSU and Friedrich Merz do not emerge victorious.\nTheir lead appears cemented and unassailable, but the major question surrounds the formation of a stable government. The CDU/CSU are unlikely to win an outright majority of the 630 seats up for grabs. That means they will have to form a coalition with one (or more) of the other parties. The question is who?\nShould the AfD perform as the opinion polls suggest, it would mark a major sea change in German politics. Since its formation in 2013, the party has never gained more than 94 seats. It finished as the fifth biggest party in 2021 and third largest in 2017.\nWhile the AfD will see themselves as potential kingmakers, the CDU/CSU may be unwilling to give them such a prominent voice in running the country.\nThat leaves the SPD, with whom they have worked previously, particularly in the Merkel era. Or, they could look further left towards the Greens, but that also may come with a clash of principles and policies, given their more left-leaning nature.\nEither way, the federal election looks likely to leave the SPD and Scholz deeply humbled, and entering into a period of self-reflection. \u201cIt is probably the end of his political career,\u201d von Randow told CNN.\nCNN\u2019s Benjamin Brown contributed to this report.\n\u00a9 2025 Cable News Network.

This blog has now closed.\nThe Green Party and the\u00a0Alternative for Germany (AfD) have slammed German public broadcasters for scheduling an election TV debate featuring only\u00a0Social Democratic (SPD) candidate and incumbent Chancellor Olaf Scholz and the leader of the conservative opposite Christian Democrats (CDU), Friedrich Merz.\nGreen Party leader Franziska Brantner took to social media to accuse license-fee-funded\u00a0ARD and ZDF of \"interfering in an open election\" by not inviting other party representatives, including the Greens' chancellor candidate Robert Habeck. \"The reality of the options to form the next government cannot reflected by a two-way debate,\" she continued. \"It requires equal opportunities.\"\nGreen Party parliamentary leader Katharina Dr\u00f6ge said: \"Are they serious? They've only invited the SPD and CDU? Some friendly support on the way back to the GroKo*?\"\nHer party colleague Irene Mihalic added: \"In an extremely short election campaign, ARD and ZDF are manufacturing a political landscape which has nothing to do with reality.\"\nThe far-right populist AfD, meanwhile, says it is considering legal action against the exclusion of party leader Alice Weidel from the debate, complaining that \"the party currently with the second-highest poll ratings\" was being relegated to the sidelines.\nThe AfD were excluded from a three-way TV debate ahead of the 2021 federal election featuring Scholz, Armin Laschet (CDU) and Annalena Baerbock (Greens).\n\"Now a new standard has been set whereby the current chancellor only faces the supposedly strongest challenger,\" said a spokesperson. \"The Greens are collateral damage and have been left behind with the AfD.\"\nScholz and Merz will face each other on free-to-air channels ARD and ZDF on February 9 and again on private channel RTL on February 16.\n*GroKo is a commonly used abbreviation for Grosse Koalition (\"Grand Coalition\"), the nickname given to a coalition government formed by Germany's two largest traditional parites, the SPD and the CDU. The GroKo last formed the German government between 2013 and 2021 under former Chancellor Angela Merkel.\nGermany's political parties have begun presenting their draft election manifestos. And with Europe's largest economy struggling, they focus on income, the economy and jobs.\nDW looks at the campaign platforms of the major parties.\nOne day after losing a vote of confidence in parliament, outgoing German Chancellor Olaf Scholz has said he hopes to visit US President-elect Donald Trump after he is formally sworn in on January 20, 2025.\nGermany's dpa news agency has reported that Scholz \"expressed his wish to visit him very soon after taking office\" when the chancellor called Trump in early November to congratulate him on defeating Joe Biden to return to the White House.\nThough Germany will likely vote on February 23 after the collapse of its government, sources in Berlin told dpa it \"cannot be ruled out\" that Scholz could meet Trump in DC.\nThough Trump took the unusual step of inviting Chinese President Xi Jinping to his swearing-in there has been no word yet as to which other leaders had been asked to attend.\nNeither Berlin nor Washington have given any indication that Scholz's name was on the list of invitees.\nThe Greens have presented their 70-page policy draft to party members, including a raft of social programs aimed at helping families and addressing climate change.\nThese include increased rent controls, keeping the 49-euro public transport ticket for all of Germany,\u00a0a minimum wage of 15 euros, and benefits for people dealing with skyrocketing energy prices.\nThe program\u00a0is \"full of measures that will make this country fairer and life more affordable,\"\u00a0party leader Felix Banaszak stressed at the presentation.\nForeign Minister Annalena Baerbock and Green chancellor candidate Robert Habeck also attended the event.\nHabeck said that addressing climate change was the party's \"top priority.\" In order to finance their ambitious climate plans, the party wants to introduce a billionaires' tax, reform the debt brake, and close tax loopholes for companies.\nFDP leader Lindner and party secretary Marco Buschmann kept their policy proposals to their party's bread and butter: the economy.\nThe business-friendly FDP said they want to lower taxes on individual earners who make less than\u00a096,600\u20ac ($101, 400) a year, as well as lower taxes on companies and on inheritance.\nChanging Germany's debt brake, which limits the amount of money the government can borrow, is \"absolutely forbidden,\" the pair confirmed.\nArguments about the debt brake were central to Lindner's falling out with Chancellor Olaf Scholz, as some economists argue that Germany's infrastructure and industry will continue to stagnate if it does not borrow money to modernize.\nThe FDP also wants to \"completely reform\" social welfare for the country's lowest earners, they said.\nAnother facet of the program is to limit the ability of \"essential workers\" to strike, such as those in the health, energy, and education sectors.\nTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video\nFormer Finance Minister Christian Lindner, whose dismissal precipitated the collapse of Germany's coalition in November, was the main speaker at his pro-business Free Democrats (FDP)'s conference on Thursday.\nThe election on \"February 23 of next year\u00a0marks a directional decision for our country,\" he said. He warned that without implementing the economic reforms his party is suggesting, \"more and more people will look for an alternative to the democratic center.\"\nHis use of the word alternative alluded to the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD), which is currently in second place in most voter surveys.\nAlthough the FDP is currently only polling at 5%, barely clearing the hurdle to enter the Bundestag, Lindner delivered his remarks with the seriousness of one who expects his party to become kingmakers in future coalition talks.\nAs it has in the past, Lindner said he was sure the FDP \"would play a key role in building the future government.\"\nLindner's open disagreements with the SPD and Green parties about policy, despite being the most junior member of the coalition, were at the heart of why Chancellor Scholz demanded his resignation.\nDuring an event to announce the party\u2019s election program, CDU and CSU leaders took to criticizing the current government and its head, Chancellor Olaf Scholz.\nCSU head Markus S\u00f6der went as far as calling Scholz \"the most embarrassing chancellor Germany has ever had.\"\nThis comes after Scholz said on television that\u00a0CDU leader Friedrich Merz \"likes to talk nonsense.\"\nS\u00f6der also criticized Germany\u2019s Green party for being \"incompetent,\"\u00a0also saying Germany\u2019s conservatives are currently unlikely to cooperate with the Greens due to their policies.\nThe conservative coalition of the CDU and CSU said that \"business as usual is not an option.\"\nGermany's conservative coalition, made of the Christian Democratic Union (CDU) and Bavarian sister party Christian Social Union (CSU) unanimously voted in favor of the party\u2019s program for the 2025 elections.\nThe program includes a promise to lower taxes and de-facto stop illegal migration.\nThe party will also continue its support for Ukraine and will re-introduce compulsory military service, previously canceled in 2011, according to a report by German news agency DPA.\nThe party\u2019s leader and Chancellor candidate\u00a0Friedrich Merz\u00a0said he believes the conservative Union \"must become the guarantors of peace and freedom.\"\nAs Germany heads for elections, authorities in Berlin fear that the February 23 vote will also be a target for pro-Russian propaganda.\nMedia investigations have pointed to Kremlin-linked efforts to support the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) and boost the Russia-friendly views of the left-wing populist Sahra Wagenknecht\u00a0Alliance (BSW).\nGermany\u2019s Interior Ministry has set up a taskforce to take \"the necessary protection measures\"\u00a0against any disinformation, sabotage, espionage and cyber attacks.\n\"Whether we like it or not, we are in a direct confrontation with Moscow,\"\u00a0Germany\u2019s foreign intelligence chief Bruno Kahl has warned.\nGermany is officially going to elections, and debate preparations are now underway.\nThis comes after the current government, under the leadership of Chancellor Olaf Scholz\u00a0of the SPD\u00a0lost a confidence vote on Monday, resulting in him asking President Frank-Walter Steinmeier to call early elections.\nScholz is expected to face his main opponent, conservative CDU\u00a0leader Friedrich Merz, in at least two televised debates prior to the elections, which are expected to take place on February 23.\nPublic broadcasters ARD and ZDF are planning one debate on February 9, while private broadcaster RTL will hold another debate on February 16.\nTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video\nftm/zc (dpa, Reuters, AFP)",

Scholz's coalition fell apart due to disagreements over spending, leading him to propose dissolving the Bundestag to the president. While his Social Democratic Party supported him, the Greens abstained to prevent support from the far-right AfD.

            "content": "Lawmakers paved the way for an early election on Feb. 23 by withdrawing their confidence in the center-left chancellor.\nAI generated Text-to-speech\nGerman Chancellor Olaf Scholz\u2019s fragile grip on power became even weaker on Monday when a  majority of the country\u2019s 733 lawmakers withdrew their confidence in him, paving the way for an early election that he\u2019s widely expected to lose.\nThe vote was a necessary step in triggering the snap poll planned by Scholz, which became inevitable after his fractured three-party coalition collapsed last month over sharp disagreements about spending.\n\u201c\u200aIn such an election, the citizens can then determine the political course of our country,\u201d the center-left chancellor told parliamentarians during a debate before the vote.\nWhile Scholz\u2019s Social Democratic Party (SPD) group in parliament confirmed its confidence in the chancellor, the Greens \u2014 with whom Scholz is currently ruling in a minority government \u2014 abstained so that the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) couldn\u2019t pull a surprise and try to prop him up.\nA small number of the AfD\u2019s 76 lawmakers had previously signaled they would vote for the chancellor as they feared his likely successor, Friedrich Merz from the center-right Christian Democratic Union (CDU), could plunge Germany into war by being a stronger backer of Ukraine against Russia than Scholz has been.\nScholz is to meet German President Frank-Walter Steinmeier on Monday afternoon, to whom he is expected to propose to dissolve the Bundestag, which the president can do within 21 days. An election would follow within another 60 days.\nUltimately, the decision on when to hold the election rests with Steinmeier. But after the heads of parliament\u2019s major groupings had agreed to hold a federal election on Sunday, Feb. 23, 2025, Steinmeier is widely expected to follow that timetable.\nThe last time a German chancellor lost a vote of confidence was in 2005 under then SPD Chancellor Gerhard Schr\u00f6der, after which the CDU\u2019s Angela Merkel came to lead Germany \u2014 and continued to do so for the following 16 years.\nChancellor Olaf Scholz\u2019s latest demand is likely to stall a \u20ac3 billion aid package to the war-ravaged country as Russian forces continue their advance.\n\u201cThe objective exchange of arguments is becoming increasingly difficult\u201d on the platform formerly known as Twitter, says defense ministry.\nThe EU\u2019s strategy to deal with the far-right Freedom Party heading for power in Vienna is \u2026 hope for the best.\nConservative chancellor candidate Friedrich Merz railed against the climate policies of the left-leaning parties he\u2019ll likely have to govern with.",

Polls indicate a significant lead for the conservative alliance under Friedrich Merz, with the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) also gaining support. Key issues in the election include Germany's struggling economy, migration, and security concerns heightened by a recent attack at a Christmas market. The election campaign is expected to be intense, with Merz\u2019s rightward shift potentially marking a significant political change in Germany.",
            "content": "Dissolving of parliament sets the stage for what could be Germany\u2019s sharpest swerve to the right in decades.\nGerman President Frank-Walter Steinmeier dissolved\u00a0the lower house of parliament, or Bundestag, on Friday in a widely expected move that clears the way for an early election on Feb. 23 that Germany\u2019s conservatives appear set to win.\nThe move comes after the collapse of German Chancellor Olaf Scholz\u2019s left-leaning three-party coalition government in November over sharp disagreements on series of issues, particularly on spending.\n\u201cEspecially in difficult times like these, stability requires a government capable of acting and reliable majorities in parliament,\u201d Steinmeier said in Berlin.\nPolls currently show the Germany\u2019s conservative alliance, led by chancellor candidate Friedrich Merz, to be far ahead in the race, with 31 percent support. The far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) is second at 19 percent, and Scholz\u2019s center-left Social Democratic Party (SPD) is third at 17 percent.\nMerz has drawn his Christian Democratic Union (CDU) sharply to the right on issues like migration and energy. Should he and his conservatives win the election, it could mark Germany\u2019s sharpest swerve to the right in decades, though that shift is likely be be somewhat moderated by the likely participation of at least one center-left party in the next coalition.\nSteinmeier\u2019s move to dissolve parliament was another step in a highly choreographed process leading to the February election, which German leaders agreed would take place shortly after the coalition collapse in November. That collapse led to a December confidence vote, which the chancellor, as expected, lost.\nGermany\u2019s constitution, which was designed to prevent the kind of political tumult that helped enable to rise of the Nazis during the Weimar Republic, contains a series of provisions intended to make the unraveling of a government as stable and orderly as possible. The German president was required to first approve Scholz\u2019s request to dissolve parliament and call for the early election on the agreed date.\nNow, with the last procedural step completed, a condensed and intensified election campaign is set to take place over the next weeks. Germany\u2019s ailing economy, the war in Ukraine, and migration are likely to be key issues.\nAlready, the campaign has been unusually heated by the relatively staid standards of German politics.\nFriedrich Merz, who is leading the race to become the next chancellor, has launched a series of scathing attacks on the current chancellor, Scholz, and his SPD as well as the Greens. Scholz has returned fire, at one point referring to Merz as \u201cLittle Fritz.\u201d\nAn attack on a Christmas market in Magdeburg that killed five people and injured scores more has also turned up the heat as revelations over a series of apparent security failures surfaced. The alleged attacker was a refugee from Saudi Arabia who authorities say had \u201cIslamophobic\u201d beliefs and made little secret of his potentially violent intentions in online posts.\nThe far-right AfD, now polling in second place, has seized on the attack to drive home its anti-immigration message, though the alleged attacker is reported to have sympathized with the party and to have embraced some far-right conspiracy theories.\n\u201cWe want something to finally change in our country, so we can finally live in safety again,\u201d Alice Weidel, the AfD\u2019s chancellor candidate declared at a rally in Magdeburg after the attack.\nPreceding the attack, Germans cited the economy as the most important issue ahead of the election, according to a\u00a0poll for public television, followed by migration. Russia\u2019s war on Ukraine was fourth on the list.\nGermans have become increasingly worried about their country\u2019s ailing economy, which is set to\u00a0contract for the second year\u00a0in a row, amid a steady drumbeat of bad economic news and announced layoffs.\nThe AfD is using Elon Musk\u2019s endorsement to reach out to Donald Trump \u2014 and to appear more acceptable at home ahead of a national election.\nThe \u201cchameleon\u201d tech billionaire is one of the most powerful politically connected people in the world. Europe\u2019s governments are still working out how to deal with being on his bad side.\nThe conservative leader\u2019s attacks signal the next government may be just as discordant as the one that recently fell.\nFriedrich Merz wants to make Germany great again, but his country is confronting global risks beyond the control of any domestic leader.",

The Greens, for instance, a party founded on a manifesto of pacifism, are now the most enthusiastic cheerleaders for rearmament.\nStability used to be one of Germany\u2019s greatest virtues. Not any more. A political crisis has triggered an early federal election on 23 February. And Europe\u2019s largest economy has been in recession for two years. German industry has been hit by soaring energy costs following EU sanctions against Russia. Major business groups such as Volkswagen are planning to cut tens of thousands of jobs, business bankruptcies are at their highest level since the 2008 financial crisis, and deindustrialisation looms. Last November, the ruling coalition between the Social Democratic Party (SPD), the Greens (Die Gr\u00fcnen) and the liberal Free Democratic Party (FDP) fell apart over 2025 budget disputes.\nPaying for arms deliveries to Ukraine has been a key factor. The huge cost of Germany\u2019s own rearmament was already weighing on government finances. Since 2022, when Chancellor Olaf Scholz pledged a special fund of \u20ac100bn (over five years) to strengthen the armed forces, the Greens, SPD and Christian Democratic Union (CDU) have talked of up to another \u20ac300bn, separate from the regular budget allocation for defence (Der Spiegel, 16\u00a0February 2024). The fact that NATO countries already have ten times Russia\u2019s military budget doesn\u2019t enter into the debate.\nAll parties except the leftwing Die Linke and Sahra Wagenknecht Alliance (BSW) agree that rearmament on an unprecedented scale is needed, but they differ on how to pay for it. The CDU, far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) and FDP propose drastic social spending cuts, while the SPD and Greens favour increased borrowing \u2013 though they have not ruled out a pro-austerity alliance with the CDU, whose leader Friedrich Merz says Germany should \u2018dare to be more capitalist\u2019.

Additionally, the United Kingdom has also placed orders for the RCH 155,\u201d United24Media reported, adding, \u201cThe RCH 155 will be deployed as part of both Ukrainian and German artillery forces.\u201d\nIn accepting the delivery of the half-dozen SPHs, Ukrainian ambassador Oleksii Makeiev praised the aid from Germany.\n\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t need mediators, we need allies,\u201d said the ambassador with a view to possible negotiations on ending the war. Peace must be fought for. It is good to know that Germany is on Ukraine\u2019s side.\u201d\nThe RCH 155 in the Crosshairs\nDevelopment of the RCH 155 (Remote Controlled Howitzer 155mm) began in 2014, and production on the first vehicles started up in 2022. According to\u00a0the platform\u2019s developer, Krauss-Maffei Wegmann (KNDS Deutschland), the RCH 155 was designed to combine \u201cthe firepower and range of the automatic and remote-controllable Artillery Gun Module (AGM) with the protection and mobility of the field-tested BOXER wheeled armoured vehicle.\u201d\nIt is armed with a\u00a0155mm/L52 main gun, which is mounted to an 8\u00d78 wheeled armored\u00a0BOXER chassis. Unlike other self-propelled howitzers, which must stop to fire, the RCH 155 is capable of firing while on the move, enhancing its flexibility.\nThe turret is remotely operated, resulting in a reduction in crew to just a commander and driver, yet it is still able to fire nine rounds per minute\u2014providing \u201cmultiple round simultaneous impact\u201d (MRSI) capability. The main gun, which is equipped with an autoloader, has a range of up to 40 km (25 miles) with base bleed (base burn) ordnance, and up to 54 km (33.5 miles) with Velocity Enhanced Long-Range Artillery Projectile (V-LAP) rounds. Even longer ranges are reported to be possible depending on the ammunition employed. The RCH 155 can carry thirty primed projectiles or up to 144 modular charges. The main gun\u00a0has an elevation\u00a0that ranges from -2.5 to +65 degrees, which\u2014unusual for an SPH\u2014allows it to employ the main gun as a direct-fire weapon to engage other vehicles in its \u201chunter-killer\u201d mode.\n\n\nIt is powered by an MTU 8V199 TE21 engine that provides upwards of 816 hp (600 kW). It has an operational range of 700 km (400 miles) on the road and can reach a top speed of 103 km/h (60 mph).\nThe vehicle\u2019s turret is made of\u00a0lightweight aluminum armor, which reduces its weight but still offers protection from small arms fire\u2014up to 7.62mm calibers\u2014as well as from artillery shell splinters. The front of the hull can also withstand fire from Russian 30x165mm armor-piercing rounds.\nAbout the author: Peter Suciu\nPeter Suciu is a Michigan-based writer.

            "content": "Mon, 27 January 2025\n\n2420 - Crisis Under Capitalism; Elon, AfD & German Elections w/ St\u00e5le Holgersen, Hanno Hauenstein\n \n\nHappy Monday! Emma speaks with St\u00e5le Holgersen, Senior Lecturer in Human Geography at Stockholm University, to discuss his recent book Against The Crisis: Economy and Ecology in a Burning World. Then, she's joined by Hanno Hauenstein, independent journalist based in Berlin, to discuss the upcoming German elections and Elon Musk's increasing influence on German politics.\u00a0First, Emma runs through updates on the Senates\u2019 confirmations of Pete Hegseth and Kristi Noam, Trump\u2019s firing of watchdogs, escalating immigration raids and their impact on Indigenous communities, ICE quotas, Colombia\u2019s rejection of a US deportation plane on humanitarian grounds (and Trump\u2019s response), the return of Palestinians to northern Gaza amid Trump\u2019s musings on fully ethnically cleansing the region, Trump\u2019s anti-abortion measures, the plunge of the AI stock market, LA\u2019s skyrocketing rent, and more, also unpacking Trump\u2019s hopeful discussion of completing the ethnic cleansing of Gaza. St\u00e5le Holgersen then joins, briefly touching on the pervasion and perversion of the term \u201ccrisis\u201d in contemporary political rhetoric before parsing through the elements that do bring these overwhelming emergencies to the level of \u201ccrisis\u201d \u2013\u00a0namely, that it\u2019s a transient event embedded in underlying sociopolitical structures, with ultimately negative consequences for humans and/or nature \u2013 and what makes distinguishing these \u201ccrisis\u201d from broader catastrophes so valuable in understanding how they are created by and are used to reinforce the capitalist system we live under. Expanding on this, Holgersen explores how capitalism has been able to adapt to the myriad crises it has created over the last few centuries, often finding ways to push solutions that affirm our commitment to capitalist systems, and the utter dearth of a true left alternative in those moments, positing the need for current leftist movements to establish a blueprint (much like capital has) for responding to crisis and presenting clear solutions in opposition to the far-right and centrist options backed by capital. Hanno Hauenstein then joins as he unpacks the rapid evolution of AfD from a standard Euroskeptic party to a staunchly nationalist and nativist one, capitalizing on long-standing distrust of German political institutions and economic anxiety post-reunification. Hauenstein and Emma then explore the stunning lack of opposition amid the rise of a rampantly xenophobic and racist political party, with the political establishment in Germany largely accommodating their anti-migrant talking points, despite their constant flirting with Holocaust denial and full-on Nazism. Wrapping up, they unpack the particular role Elon Musk has played in backing AfD\u2019s rise to prevalence in German politics, as well as the role of Germany\u2019s unconditional support for Israel in further legitimizing AfD\u2019s hopes of a far-right regime and undermining their strongest opposition. And in the Fun Half: Emma talks with Connor from West Virginia about Trump\u2019s clashes with major Latin American leaders over his inhumane anti-immigration policies, JD Vance \u2013 proud Catholic convert \u2013 calls the US Conference of Catholic Bishops a bunch of fraudsters for criticizing Trump\u2019s immigration policy, and Danny from NYC unpacks Trump\u2019s continued attacks on attempts to normalize US-Cuba relations. A caller dives into Starbucks\u2019 \u00a0crackdown on homeless people (or anyone else) using the bathroom, MPT from VT explores the AI industry\u2019s rejection of consent, and Michael Knowles (proudly) proclaims the American nature of mass deportation.

A recent poll indicates 56% of Germans disapprove of Scholz's performance amid economic stagnation and migration policy criticism. Musk suggested that the right-wing Alternative for Germany (AfD) party would achieve significant success in the elections, prompting backlash from German officials who viewed his comments as unwelcome interference. Scholz emphasized that the election outcome will be determined by the German populace, not social media figures.",
            "content": "Elon Musk has forecasted that German Chancellor Olaf Scholz, who he mockingly referred to as \u201cOaf Schitz,\u201d as well as his Social Democratic Party (SPD) will lose the Federal Republic\u2019s upcoming parliamentary elections.\nGermany will hold snap elections at the end of February; Scholz's \u2018traffic light\u2019 coalition government has collapsed over disagreements regarding Ukraine aid, economic reforms and climate policy. Earlier this month, the SPD leader lost a vote of confidence in parliament, leading to its dissolution.\nAccording to Statista, 56% of Germans believe Scholz has done a poor job, while 37% are satisfied with his performance. The rating was influenced by Germany's economic stagnation, his migration policies, and a general perception of ineffective government.\nMusk, who has been a consistent critic of the current German government, took a jab at Scholz on Monday, predicting that \u201cChancellor Oaf Schitz or whatever his name is will lose.\u201d\nThe tycoon also suggested that the right-wing, anti-immigration Alternative for Germany (AfD) party \u2013 which he previously praised as the country\u2019s \u201clast spark of hope\u201d \u2013 would \u201cwin an epic victory\u201d in the election.\nMusk\u2019s apparent endorsement, however, has sparked a backlash from German officials, who described his comments as \u201cintrusive and arrogant,\u201d suggesting they constitute unwelcome interference. Chancellor Scholz noted that the country\u2019s future \u201cwill not be decided by the owners of social media channels\u201d but rather by the country\u2019s \u201cvast majority of reasonable and decent people.\u201d\nThe billionaire\u2019s comments follow a terrorist attack on a Christmas market in Magdeburg earlier this month, in which a car rammed into a crowd, killing five people and injuring nearly 200. The incident, linked to a Saudi asylum seeker, has intensified criticism of Chancellor Olaf Scholz's government, with opposition parties and far-right groups blaming lax migration policies ahead of Germany\u2019s snap elections.\nRT News App\n\u00a9 Autonomous Nonprofit Organization \u201cTV-Novosti\u201d, 2005\u20132025.

            "content": "Thierry Breton, former French European Commissioner for Digital Affairs, warned that German federal elections could be annulled if conducted improperly, citing a precedent set in Romania.  Breton emphasized that existing laws are robust enough to deter unlawful activities, but stressed the need for authorities to take stringent actions if CEO of Tesla and X Elon Musk were to break the law by supporting the extremist Alternative for Germany (AfD) party.  Breton acknowledged Musk's right to free speech but warned against abusing it to interfere with democratic processes, stating that European laws on digital services must be enforced to protect the integrity of electoral processes.  The former commissioner urged authorities to stay vigilant and enforce existing laws to safeguard European democracies, emphasizing the importance of upholding democratic principles and the possibility of fines and bans for those who circumvent these laws.  Musk and Breton engaged in a heated online exchange. Musk referred to Breton as \"the tyrant of Europe,\" while Breton denied accusations of EU mechanisms to nullify elections and accused Musk of lying about attempts to stop his interview with the AfD leader.  Former French European Commissioner for Digital Affairs Thierry Breton has openly admitted to interfering in the Romanian presidential election and has warned that similar action may be taken in Germany, should they be conducted improperly.\n In a recent Radio Monte Carlo (RMC) interview on Jan. 9, Breton raised the possibility of annulment for the German federal elections. Breton emphasized the need for calm and stressed that existing laws are robust enough to deter unlawful activities.\n However, he also warned that if Musk, the CEO of Tesla and X, were to break the law, especially by supporting the extremist Alternative for Germany (AfD) party, the authorities would need to take stringent actions. Breton cited the precedent of Romania, where presidential elections were canceled following a controversial TikTok campaign by candidate Calin Georgescu, as a possible model for Germany. (Related: Efforts to ban Alternative for Germany Party face hurdles as political landscape evolves.)\n \"If, on the other hand, the Tesla and X boss breaks the law, especially in Germany, by supporting the 'extremist' AfD party, the former European Commissioner believes that it will be necessary for the authorities to act as in Romania, where the presidential elections were canceled,\" the website of the French television BFMTV wrote.\n Breton acknowledged Musk's right to free speech, stating \"Freedom of expression is a fundamental element in Europe.\" However, he cautioned that this right must not be abused to interfere with democratic processes. \"The law exists, and it must be enforced to protect our democracies,\"\u00c2\u00a0Breton emphasized.\n The former commissioner stressed that Musk's support for the AfD and his controversial interview with the party's leader, Alice Weidel, raise serious concerns about potential breaches of European laws on digital services. He then urged authorities to stay vigilant and enforce existing laws to safeguard the integrity of the electoral process.\n \"If they don't, there are fines and the possibility of a ban,\" Breton said. \"We are equipped to enforce these laws to protect our democracies in Europe.\"\n He concluded by reiterating the importance of upholding democratic principles, stating, \"Let\u00e2\u0080\u0099s stay calm and enforce the laws in Europe, when they risk being circumvented and if not enforced, could lead to interference. They did it in Romania and, obviously, it will have to be done, if necessary, in Germany as well.\"\nBreton clashes with Musk over \"tyrant\" slur and EU interference claims These statements from Breton have sparked a more heated online exchange between him and Musk.\n A few days after the interview with Breton, Musk shared a clip on X, referring to Breton as \"the tyrant of Europe.\" He also added, \"Man, American 'foreign interference' is the only reason you aren't speaking German or Russian today,\" in reference to the American landings in France during World War II.\n In response to Musk's claims, Breton wrote on X, \"Tyrant of Europe?

He defended Germany's new Citizenship Law, which facilitates dual citizenship and is significant for the Turkish community, against criticism from rival Friedrich Merz, who aims to overturn it.

            "content": "Scholz reaches out to German-Turkish voters, defends dual citizenship law\nBERLIN\n\nChancellor Olaf Scholz on Thursday called on German-Turkish voters to support his Social Democratic Party (SPD) in the upcoming snap elections, pledging to maintain his commitment to addressing immigrants' concerns.\n\u201cGermany is a country of immigration\u2014one in four people among us has an immigration background,\u201d the Social Democrat said in a video message posted on social media.\n\u201cThose who live and work here, who are well-integrated, who speak our language, belong to our country and should have a voice in our democracy,\u201d he stressed.\nScholz sharply criticized his rival Friedrich Merz, the chancellor candidate of the Christian Democrats (CDU/CSU), for his intention to overturn Germany's new citizenship law and revoke citizenship for dual nationals.\n\u201cThis threatens to take us backward. Let me be clear: we must not let it get to that point. We must not create divisions between long-time residents and newcomers. Creating such divisions cannot and must not be our path. Unity\u2014that is our way,\u201d he said.\nGermany\u2019s new Citizenship Law, which took effect in June 2024, streamlines the process for immigrants to obtain German citizenship and permits dual citizenship.

Their manifesto includes security guarantees for Ukraine and potential participation in peacekeeping negotiations. However, skepticism about further arms deliveries, particularly Taurus missiles, exists among voters, especially in eastern Germany and Bavaria. The CDU/CSU propose a defense budget of 2-3% of GDP, while the outcome of future coalition governments will significantly impact Germany's security policy direction, especially with potential pressures from a second Trump presidency.",
            "content": "During their election campaign, Germany's conservatives have prioritized defense spending and supplying more arms to Ukraine. Though they are polling well, their proposals do not reflect the priorities of German voters.\nThe joint election manifesto for the Christian Democrats (CDU) and their Bavarian allies, the Christian Social Union (CSU) includes security guarantees for Ukraine that Germany could make good on\u00a0along with the US and its European partners in NATO.\n\"Ukraine also defends us,\" the manifesto reads. \"If Ukraine falls, there is the threat of an attack on another EU country.\"\nThe CDU and CSU consider it possible that Germany would participate in negotiations toward a ceasefire in Ukraine, even if that were to mean the deployment of Bundeswehr soldiers to keep the peace. Politicians for the parties are reluctant to talk about that part, as security is not a high priority for voters in February's election.\nThe greatest skepticism about further arms deliveries to Ukraine comes from eastern Germany and the wealthy southern state of Bavaria.\nSo far, the government, led by Chancellor Olaf Scholz, of\u00a0the center-left Social Democrats\u00a0(SPD), has refused to supply Taurus cruise missiles on the grounds that Ukraine could use them to hit targets within Russia, which would make Germany a party to the war.\nThe US, the UK and France have already supplied similar longer-range weapons that allow Ukraine to strike targets across the border.\nThe argument that Germany should not allow itself to be drawn into the war was also used by Bavarian State Premiere Markus S\u00f6der, of the CSU, at his election campaign launch in Seeon.\nBut S\u00f6der did not respond to a question from\u00a0DW about Taurus missiles, saying the decision would be up to the next chancellor.\nThomas Erndl, a CSU deputy who sits on the Bundestag's foreign affairs committee, told DW that \"the opinion has become entrenched among the population that arms deliveries fuel war, while stopping deliveries slows it down.\"\n\"We have to contend with this mood,\"\u00a0Erndl\u00a0said.\nThe CDU's candidate for chancellor,\u00a0Friedrich Merz, has publicly declared his willingness to supply Taurus missiles, but only in consultation with European NATO\u00a0partners. However, the CDU/CSU election manifesto stakes out no clear position on the issue.\nIn contrast, the neoliberal Free Democrats (FDP) are\u00a0\u00a0in favor of \"the immediate delivery of Taurus cruise missiles,\" while the SPD is clearly against it.\nHow decisively Germany's\u00a0next government will ultimately act largely depends on two factors.\nThe first has to do with the geopolitical dynamics after January 20, when Donald Trump will be sworn in as US president for the second time. Trump is likely to put considerable pressure on Germany, both economically and in terms of security policy.\nDecisions would have to be made more quickly, and more money would be needed, a high-ranking CDU politician from eastern Germany told DW. \"When the ceasefire in Ukraine comes,\" the politician said, \"we will have to pay for it.\"\nThe populist-presenting parties, the far-right Alternative for Germany and the Sahra Wagenknecht Alliance, have been particularly successful with their pro-Russia stance in eastern Germany.\nThe CDU and CSU have stated that they will not cave to Trump's demands that Germany spend\u00a05% of GDP on defense, noting that the United States does not spend that much either.\nThe policy platform states that Germany would spend\u00a02% of GDP on defense. The parties even advocate a target of\u00a03% in a country where the arms industry holds considerable political sway.\nThe second factor on which Germany's security policy depends is the question of the makeup of any future coalition government.\n\"If the CDU/CSU were to govern with the SPD, security policy would proceed with the handbrake on,\" Gustav Gressel, a former senior research fellow with the European Council of Foreign Relations whose areas of expertise include Russia and defense policy, told DW.\nGressel said he expected members of the SPD who \"continue the 'peace policy,' which is actually 'peace populism,'\" to join such a government.\n\"The SPD would then fall back into its old position and use the fear strategy to distance itself from its larger coalition partner,\" Gressel said.\nTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video\nMerz would likely face critics on foreign and security policy issues both from within the coalition through the SPD and within the CDU and CSU, he said.\nA coalition between the CDU/CSU and the Greens, the junior partners in the current government, could put Germany in a leading position in terms of security policy more quickly.\nThe Greens have done a complete U-turn on security policy since Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022. The party, which has many pacifists among its ranks, used to categorically reject arms deliveries to crisis regions.\nNow, the Greens are among the biggest supporters of military aid for Ukraine \u2014 including the delivery of weapons systems.\nThough Taurus cruise missiles would\u00a0not be a \"game changer\" in the war, Gressel said,\u00a0they have become a powerful symbol of German angst.\nChancellor Scholz has \"deliberately stirred up fear among the population with made-up\u00a0arguments,\" Gressel said.\nThere is little doubt among experts and within the CDU/CSU that Germany would supply the Taurus missiles to Ukraine with Merz as chancellor as part of an overall effort to appear\u00a0more robust on foreign policy than his predecessor.\nThis article was originally written in German.\nWhile you're here: Every Tuesday, DW editors round up what is happening in German politics and society.

He criticized CDU leader Friedrich Merz for potentially collaborating with the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) on migration laws, following a tragic knife attack by an Afghan refugee. Habeck emphasized that the upcoming February election is crucial for Germany's political future and urged voters to reject extremist movements that threaten democracy and progress on issues like climate change.",
            "content": "The economy minister and Green Party chancellor candidate says Germany could follow Austria\u2019s far-right path, as the CDU signals willingness to erode its firewall against the AfD ahead of a pivotal election.\nBERLIN \u2014 German Green Party chancellor candidate and Economy Minister Robert Habeck issued a stark warning on Sunday that Germany could face a far-right political takeover akin to Austria\u2019s current trajectory.\n\u201cIf it can happen in Austria, it can also happen in Germany,\u201d Habeck said at the Green Party convention in Berlin. \u201cAnd the decision whether it will happen is now up for election.\u201d\nHabeck pointed to the rise of Austria\u2019s far-right Freedom Party (FP\u00d6), now forging a coalition government, as a cautionary tale for Germany\u2019s own political landscape.\nThe FP\u00d6, a party with deep nationalist roots, is leading negotiations to form a coalition with the conservative Austrian People\u2019s Party (\u00d6VP) after centrist forces failed to form a government. For Habeck, the parallels to Germany are clear: In both countries, far-right parties have surged in popularity amid migration debates and public safety concerns.\nThe warning comes as Germany grapples with the fallout from a recent knife attack by an Afghan refugee, which left two people dead, including a two-year-old child. The incident has intensified calls for stricter migration controls, a policy platform being championed by Christian Democratic Union (CDU) leader Friedrich Merz, who is leading the polls at around 30 percent.In response to the tragedy, Merz proposed closing Germany\u2019s borders to all illegal entries, including asylum seekers \u2014 a position that could draw support from the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD). Merz\u2019s remarks, which included a call to act \u201cregardless of who agrees with our proposals,\u201d have fueled speculation that the CDU is willing to risk breaking the taboo of working with the AfD in the pursuit of tougher migration laws.\nThe AfD, polling at around 20 percent and holding its own conference in the eastern city of Halle over the weekend, celebrated the potential collapse of Germany\u2019s political firewall, the so-called Brandmauer, that mainstream parties have upheld for years to isolate the far right.\nHabeck directly criticized Merz for considering the AfD\u2019s backing to pass migration laws in the Bundestag. \u201cNothing about this is harmless,\u201d Habeck warned. \u201cIt should not be dismissed as a strategic mistake.\u201d He urged Merz to reconsider, warning that such moves erode democratic norms: \u201cForgetting history leads to completely, completely wrong results in Europe.\u201d\nFor Habeck, the situation in Austria as well as developments in Germany highlight what can happen when mainstream parties fail to stand together against nationalist forces.\n\u201cAustria is very close to us in culture and political tradition,\u201d Habeck said. \u201cIn Austria, it has not been possible for a coalition of conservative Social Democrats and a progressive, liberal party to form a government, although they knew that a right-wing extremist party could then take over the government.\u201d\nFraming the upcoming Feb. 23 federal election as a referendum on Germany\u2019s political future, Habeck warned that the stakes go beyond migration policy. \u201cThis federal election has suddenly turned into a true election of alternatives,\u201d he said. \u201cIt asks the fundamental questions: Will Germany, will Europe, rise to the challenges we face, and how?\u201d\nHabeck tied the fight against far-right populism to broader struggles for democracy and climate action, calling on voters to reject what he described as a dangerous slide toward authoritarianism.\nEuropean Commission president is in Berlin for her first public appearance since she was admitted to hospital.\nGerman Chancellor appeals to the EU executive to slash regulation and support industry with subsidies \u2014 only to be accused by his conservative opponents of stealing their policies.\nWith voters going to the polls in February, the tragedy ramps up concerns about security.\nPoliticians want to invest \u20ac50B in modern infrastructure over the next ten years.",

Two labor unions and the top federal court have also departed from the platform.\nThe German Defense Ministry and the Armed Forces (the Bundeswehr) followed suit on Wednesday by announcing that they will no longer make any posts on the platform, claiming that X makes it \u201cdifficult to have a factual exchange.\u201d\nRT News App\n\u00a9 Autonomous Nonprofit Organization \u201cTV-Novosti\u201d, 2005\u20132025.

The AfD is polling at around 20%, trailing the Christian Democratic Union at 31%, with all major parties excluding the AfD from potential coalitions. The election is set for February 23.",
            "content": "Alternative for Germany (AfD) co-leader Alice Weidel has pledged to put the sabotaged Nord Stream gas pipelines back into operation if her party emerges victorious in next month\u2019s general election.\nAfD members met in the town of Riesa on Saturday to formally approve Weidel as their candidate to succeed Chancellor Olaf Scholz, whose coalition government collapsed late last year. Weidel\u2019s nomination marks the right-wing AfD\u2019s first bid for the chancellery in its 11-year history.\nIn a speech after the nomination vote, Weidel promised to implement harsh immigration policies \u2013 including the \u201cremigration\u201d of immigrants already living legally in Germany \u2013 and to scrap the outgoing Scholz\u2019s green policies in a bid to drive down energy prices. Restoring energy ties to Russia is vital to this latter goal, she explained.\n\u201cWe will put Nord Stream back into operation, you can count on it,\u201d Weidel told her party.\nGermany relied on Russia for 55% of its natural gas supply before the Ukraine conflict escalated in February 2022. Much of this gas flowed through the Nord Stream 1 pipelines, with the parallel Nord Stream 2 lines due to come online in 2022. However, Berlin revoked the certification for Nord Stream 2 several days before Russia\u2019s military operation in Ukraine began, and\u00a0most of the lines were destroyed in an act of sabotage in September of that year.\nWhile German investigators have reportedly settled on the theory that the pipelines were destroyed by Ukrainian saboteurs, American journalist Seymour Hersh maintains that they were blown up by the CIA and US Navy. The head of Russia\u2019s Foreign Intelligence Service (SVR), Sergey Naryshkin, has blamed \u201cprofessional saboteurs from the Anglo-American special services,\u201d referring to the US and UK.\nScholz\u2019s decision to halt Russian energy imports, coupled with his government\u2019s green policies, has led to soaring electricity costs in Germany, forcing some of the country\u2019s manufacturing giants \u2013 including Volkswagen and BASF \u2013 to close plants and lay off workers.\nThe AfD is not the only German party that wants to repair and reopen Nord Stream. The leftist Sahra Wagenknecht Alliance (BSW) has also demanded that they be brought back online, with BSW MP Sevim Dagdelen calling last week for the gas lines to \u201cfinally be put into operation,\u201d and for the German government to \u201cstop giving money to Kiev!\u201d\nGermans go to the polls to choose a new government on February 23. The AfD is currently polling at around 20%, ahead of Scholz\u2019s center-left Social Democratic Party (SPD) at 16%, but behind the center-right Christian Democratic Union (CDU) at 31%. However, even if the AfD were to emerge as the largest party next month, all of Germany\u2019s other mainstream parties have ruled out entering a coalition with it.\nRT News App\n\u00a9 Autonomous Nonprofit Organization \u201cTV-Novosti\u201d, 2005\u20132025.

The post has since been corrected, and the politicians will undergo a refresher course on submarines following the incident.",
            "content": "Two members of German Chancellor Olaf Scholz's party have made a mistake while campaigning for the upcoming federal election, confusing a German submarine with a Russian one.\nChristina Schubert, a Bundestag candidate from the port city of Kiel, and lawmaker Kristian Klinck, who was born in the same city \u2013 both from the Social Democratic Party of Germany (SPD) \u2013 shared a post on Instagram over the weekend, hailing parliament\u2019s recent approval of the purchase of German-made Type 212CD submarines.\nHowever, instead of the German vessel, the post featured a Russian Kilo-class submarine (\u201cProject 636\u201d).\nThe mistake was reported by Kiel-based publication Kieler Nachrichten on Monday, which described the post as an \u201cembarrassing faux pas.\u201d The post then went viral on social media.\nTabloid Bild published an equally scathing assessment on Tuesday. \u201cEmbarrassing SPD blunder \u2013 in the submarine stronghold of Kiel of all places!\u201d it wrote. The publication pointed out that the port city is home to the headquarters of the vessel\u2019s manufacturer, ThyssenKrupp Marine Systems (TKMS), and that the company is the only German systems provider for submarines.\n\u201cOh, my goodness. Something went wrong,\u201d was Schubert\u2019s response to an inquiry, Kieler Nachrichten said.\n\u201cThe reason for the error was that I did not carry out a sufficiently thorough final check of the social media post,\u201d Klinck admitted to the publication.\nThe original Instagram post has since been edited and the picture replaced with that of an actual 212CD submarine.\nSchubert and Klinck will have a refresher course on submarines and visit the TKMS shipyard, the largest in Germany, on Wednesday, Kieler Nachrichten wrote.\nGermany's budget committee approved the purchase of four 212CD submarines in the week before Christmas in a deal worth \u20ac 4.7 billion ($4.92 billion).\nThe deal is part of Germany\u2019s push to bring its defense spending in line with the NATO target of 2% of national output. The funds will come from a \u20ac100 billion special fund announced by Scholz shortly after the escalation of the Ukraine conflict in 2022.\nThe Russian Kilo-class submarine, designated as \u201cProject 636,\u201d is a series of diesel-electric attack submarines developed in St. Petersburg. Renowned for their stealth capabilities, they are often referred to as \u201cBlack Holes\u201d due to their exceptionally low acoustic signature, making them difficult to detect underwater.\nEquipped with cruise missiles, the submarines are part of Russia's Black Sea Fleet and have been actively used in the Ukraine conflict.\nRT News App\n\u00a9 Autonomous Nonprofit Organization \u201cTV-Novosti\u201d, 2005\u20132025.

            "content": "Elon Musk created yet another controversy this week when he agreed with far-right German politician Alice Weidel that Adolf Hitler was a communist.\nSpotted by Wired, Musk engaged in a bizarre interview with Weidel, in which the German politician tried to claim that Hitler was a communist.\n\u201c[Hitler] was a communist, and he considered himself as a socialist,\u201d Weidel said.\n\u201cThe biggest success after that terrible era in our history was to label Adolf Hitler as right[-wing] and conservative, he was exactly the opposite,\u201d Weidel added. \u201cHe wasn\u2019t a conservative, he wasn\u2019t a libertarian, he was a communist, socialist guy, and we are the opposite.\u201d\n\u201cRight,\u201d Musk responded.\nGrok, Musk\u2019s own AI model, disagreed with the tech executive, saying his agreement with Weidel \u201cappears to be rooted in a misunderstanding or misrepresentation of historical facts.\u201d\nWhen asked if Hitler was a communist, Grok replied with the following:\nAdolf Hitler was vehemently opposed to communism. His stance was characterized by:\nIn summary, Hitler\u2019s opposition to communism was both ideological and strategic, serving as a core component of his political agenda and propaganda.\nWhen asked why Musk agreed with Weidel, Grok responded with the following:\nElon Musk\u2019s agreement with Alice Weidel\u2019s claim that Adolf Hitler was a communist appears to be rooted in a misunderstanding or misrepresentation of historical facts. Here\u2019s a breakdown based on the available context:\nWeidel and Musk seem to focus on the \u201cSocialist\u201d aspect of the Nazi Party\u2019s name, the National Socialist German Workers\u2019 Party (NSDAP). However, despite the name, the Nazis were fundamentally anti-communist and anti-socialist in practice. Their socialism was more about national unity and control rather than the traditional socialist principles of workers\u2019 rights and collective ownership.\nIn conclusion, Musk\u2019s agreement with Weidel\u2019s claim appears to be based on a significant misrepresentation of history, possibly influenced by current political narratives or a lack of in-depth understanding of the ideological nuances of the Nazi regime. This stance diverges sharply from the historical consensus that Hitler was a fascist dictator who was vehemently opposed to communism.\nMusk\u2019s response and engagement with Weidel underscores the growing risks associated with the executive\u2019s increasingly controversial stance on issues.\nMusk\u2019s handling of the Twitter purchase, defaulting on leases, refusing to honor severance agreements, banning journalists who disagree with him from X (despite claiming to be a free speech advocate), and much more has contributed to Tesla\u2019s \u201cconsideration score\u201d cratering in recent years.\nMarket intelligence firm Caliber monitors brands\u2019 consideration scores, based on a variety of factors. According to the firm, Tesla\u2019s score dropped from 70% in 2021 to a mere 31% in 2024.\n\u201cIt\u2019s very likely that Musk himself is contributing to the reputational downfall,\u201d said Caliber CEO Shahar Silbershatz.\nIt\u2019s a safe bet that Musk agreeing with the leader of a political party with ties to neo-Nazism is not going to help his companies, a point Grok itself makes:\nElon Musk\u2019s alignment with Alice Weidel, particularly in light of her party\u2019s (Alternative for Germany or AfD) ties to neo-Nazism, could indeed have repercussions for his companies.\nSubscribe for Updates\nCEO related news and updates.\nGet the free daily newsletter read by decision makers\nGet our media kit\nDeliver your marketing message directly to decision makers.",

Analysts suggest Musk's controversial online behavior may be impacting Tesla's sales, which dropped 41% in 2024. Companies like Rossmann and LichtBlick have halted Tesla vehicle use, citing incompatibility with their values. While the boycott may not significantly affect Tesla financially, it could damage the company's public image. The situation reflects growing dissatisfaction with Musk's political stance among consumers and businesses aligned with diversity and tolerance.",
            "content": "A boycott of Tesla vehicles is gaining momentum in Germany due to Elon Musk\u2019s consistent meddling in the country\u2019s politics and promotion of a fringe far-right party.\nMany analysts and Tesla followers have been alleging that Elon Musk\u2019s social media antics promoting misinformation and meddling in politics are affecting Tesla\u2019s sales, which were down for the first time in a decade last year.\nBut it is extremely difficult to directly link the two.\nHowever, there are a few direct examples of Tesla\u2019s CEO being directly responsible for Tesla missing out on sales.\nLast year, we reported that Rossmann, a German company that operates one of the largest pharmacy chains in Europe,\u00a0was electrifying its entire corporate car fleet and using Tesla vehicles to do so, but it announced that it would sell all its Tesla vehicles and replace them by other EVs.\nThe company specifically mentioned \u201cincompatibility between the statements of Tesla CEO Elon Musk and the values \u200b\u200bthat Tesla represents with its products\u201d as a reason for the move.\nMore recently, Musk has ramped up his comments on German politics, and he has been promoting AfD, a far-right political party that has been labeled as an \u201cextremist organization\u201d in which many members have been promoting neo-nazi ideology.\nMusk urged Germans to vote for AfD in the upcoming elections.\nThis, and his constant promoting of misinformation on X, which X\u2019s unknown \u201ctruth-seeking AI\u201d Grok confirmed, have led to a boycott of Musk\u2019s X platform in Germany launched by \u201cmore than 60 German and Austrian academic organizations.\u201c\nThe X boycott is now spreading to Tesla.\nAfter Rossmann, LichtBlick, a large energy company in Germany, is joining the Tesla boycott. The company announced on LinkedIn this week:\nWe are pulling the plug on Tesla vehicles in our fleet. This decision was made by our management together with the Facilities and Real Estate team..\nKevin L\u00fctje, LichtBlick\u2019s Head of Facilities and Real Estate, commented on the move:\n\u201cElon Musk\u2019s support of Donald Trump and his recommendation to vote for a right-wing populist and right-wing extremist party that is in no way compatible with LichtBlick\u2019s values \u200b\u200bprompted us to take this step. We are committed to diversity, tolerance and democracy. And of course climate protection and electromobility are extremely important to us. But in the future we will be relying on providers other than Tesla. All current contracts with Tesla vehicles will not be renewed after the contract ends.\u201d\nThe company said it is \u201caware that this will not have far-reaching economic consequences for Tesla\u201d, but it wants to set an example.\nWhile it might not have a big impact, Tesla\u2019s sales are already crashing in Germany. Sales are down 41% or about 26,000 units in 2024 versus 2023.\nA lot of that decrease can be attributed to reduced EV incentives, but other electric vehicles have faired a lot better than Tesla.\nJust noting that the primary effect of boycotts isn't to reduce sales but to change the public image of the targeted company. Germany's AfD is likely to poll 20% at the highest, with the vast majority Germans strongly disliking it. Musk's tying of Tesla to AfD, something that the boycott will reinforce, is not a good business move.\nAlso, Musk has been focusing on German politics more recently, and therefore, his impact on the market is likely to be felt more in 2025.\n\u201cIncompatibility between the statements of Tesla CEO Elon Musk and the values \u200b\u200bthat Tesla represents with its products\u201d is also why I sold my Tesla stocks.\nHe is steering Tesla away from its noble original mission.\nIt\u2019s hard to gauge his actual impact on Tesla\u2019s sales, but these are direct examples. If this boycott starts to gain more momentum, maybe (big maybe) Tesla shareholders will start to respond and react appropriately by voting out Tesla\u2019s board, which has been backing Musk at every corner.\nFTC: We use income earning auto affiliate links.

            "content": "Friedrich Merz, an erstwhile rival of former German Chancellor Angela Merkel, has been a beacon of hope for the conservative CDU party. He now wants to unseat Chancellor Olaf Scholz and take over as Germany's leader.\nFriedrich Merz\u00a0has a good chance of becoming Germany's next chancellor. As the leader of the center-right Christian Democratic Union party (CDU) and the conservative parliamentary group that includes Bavaria's Christian Social Union (CSU), he will be the bloc's top candidate, taking on\u00a0the Social Democrats\u00a0(SPD) in the February 23 general election. Though Merz has never held government office, opinion polls suggest that he is the favorite in the race.\n\u00a0\nAt the age of 69,\u00a0Merz would become the oldest person to take office as Germany's head of government since Konrad Adenauer, who was 73 years old when he was sworn in as the first chancellor of the Federal Republic in 1949.\n\u00a0\nMerz has had two political lives: one before Angela Merkel came to power as chancellor in 2005 and the second after she exited in 2021.\nHe had slowly withdrawn from politics after Merkel's initial election as German chancellor. Merkel, who is often referred to as Merz's \"nemesis,\"\u00a0was a pragmatist and moderate\u00a0who did not see eye to eye with the staunch conservative Friedrich Merz.\nHe then took a break from politics in 2009, returning to the Bundestag only in 2021 after Merkel had retired.\nMerz hails from the rural Sauerland area of Germany's most-populous state, North Rhine-Westphalia. He\u00a0is a wealthy corporate lawyer, a father of three and a Catholic. He started his political career as amember of the European Parliament for the CDU in 1989, at the age of 33. Five years later, in 1994, he switched to the German lower house of Parliament, the Bundestag, where his sharp oratory skills drew attention. He became an influential member of the conservative parliamentary group (CDU/CSU).\nMerz's withdrawal from politics dovetailed with successes\u00a0in the private sector: From 2005 to 2021, he was a member of the international law firm Mayer Brown LLP and held top positions on supervisory and administrative boards. From 2016 to 2020, Merz was chairman of the supervisory board of the German arm of Blackrock, the world's largest asset manager.\nIn 2022, on Merz's third attempt at the post, the CDU elected him as party leader.\nMerz had a reputation as an economically liberal representative of the conservative CDU wing. In 2008 he wrote a book entitled \"Mehr Kapitalismus wagen\" (Dare More Capitalism) championing a liberal economic policy, slashing bureaucracy, reducing social benefits and cutting taxes for companies.\nTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video\nIn the 1990s, Merz was in the minority even in the conservative CDU when he voted against liberalizing the abortion law\u00a0and against preimplantation genetic diagnostics in the Bundestag. When parliament passed a bill to criminalize marital rape like any other rape in 1997, Merz voted against it.\nMerz has always been a supporter of nuclear energy and has expressed doubts over renewable energy sources such as \"ugly\" wind turbines.\nHe drew flak in 2022 for flying his private jet to attend Finance Minister Christian Lindner's wedding on the island of Sylt\u00a0at a time of rising energy prices caused by Russia's war on Ukraine.\nMerz has also been accused of pandering to the far right with denigrating remarks about refugees.\nOn a TV talk show, he said female school teachers in Germany were experiencing\u00a0a lack of respect from what he called \"little pashas,\" apparently referring to sons of Muslim parents.\nThat remark came only weeks after Merz referred to some displaced Ukrainians as \"welfare tourists\" \u2014 claiming that many of them had come to Germany seeking safety, only to then travel back and forth between both countries once they have secured social benefits.\nMerz later offered an apology of sorts: \"I regret using the word 'welfare tourism.' It was an inaccurate description of a problem observed in individual cases.\"\nMerz previously complained about \"problems with foreigners\" and insisted on a German \"Leitkultur\" (dominant culture), \u00a0a term dating back to the 1990s that many argue is a call for compulsory assimilation.\nHe represents a CDU that has become more conservative, although he has stated his refusal to cooperate with the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD).\nShortly after Germany's center-left government collapsed on November 6, 2024, Merz stated in clear terms that the years of Scholz's coalition were now history, arguing that this had been a long time coming.\nMerz is hoping that he and the CDU/CSU will replace Olaf Scholz and his minority government with the Greens following the February 23 election. It remains to be seen which coalition partners he would choose to form a new government.\nThis article was originally written in German.\nWhile you're here: Every Tuesday, DW editors round up what is happening in German politics and society.

She highlighted that German development aid has decreased significantly, currently at \u20ac125 million, primarily for basic necessities. Despite budget cuts and skepticism about foreign projects, Schulze aims to enhance development assistance, focusing on gender equality, with a goal for 93% of projects to promote it by 2025. As the SPD navigates a minority government and faces upcoming elections, Schulze's future in her role remains uncertain amid declining poll numbers for her party.",
            "content": "German Development Minister Svenja Schulze sees new potential for Germany's involvement in Syria. And finds herself defending her projects against criticism, including from right-wing extremists.\nSvenja Schulze, the German development minister of the center-left Social Democratic Party (SPD), had scheduled a press conference in Berlin to speak about the last three extremely difficult years for her ministry: During this time, the projects she has been working on around the world had come under constant attack. Especially from right-wing populists who have been gaining ground in Germany and who often express nothing but hatred and derision for anyone offering support to the poor in the global South.\nBut given the very urgent situation in Syria, the SPD politician took the opportunity to talk about the new potential she sees for Germany's involvement there. In the years since the start of the Syrian civil war in 2011, German development assistance to the country has fallen to currently \u20ac125 million ($132 million).\nThat money was used to support United Nations projects, such as providing drinking water to Aleppo. In other words, the basic necessities on the smallest level, more was simply not possible because of the constant fighting in the country.\nBut now Schulze wants to do more. \"The Development Ministry has been preparing for this moment for 13 years. Building state structures is our core business,\u201d she said.\nTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video\nBut it was this core business that was repeatedly criticized during the almost three years in which the coalition government of SPD, environmentalist Greens, and neoliberal Free Democrats (FDP)were in power.\nDuring negotiations on the 2025 budget, Schulze only just managed to secure \u20ac10.3 billion for her ministry, almost a billion euros less than in 2024. There had been repeated claims that Germany could no longer afford expensive projects abroad at a time when housing is becoming scarce and infrastructure is crumbling at home.\nFollowing the collapse of the coalition, the budget remains unresolved, but it seems unlikely that the Development Ministry will receive more money in the future. Still clearly outraged, Schulze said: \"What was new was the intensity of the criticism and the deliberate spreading of falsehoods. We saw a perfect example of this with the now famed bike paths in Peru.\"\nThe Alternative for Germany (AfD), a party with some far-right extremist factions, had claimed that Schulze was spending a whopping \u20ac315 million on new cycle paths in the Latin American country. In fact, it was only around 20 million euros in grants and a further 40 million euros in loans \u2014\u00a0money that will be paid back. Schulze has now added the information that German companies were also involved in the construction of the bike paths, which were used as a means of connecting to the metro system. Because German companies were involved, the project was also of benefit to the German economy.\nTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video\nAccording to Schulze, the projects in Peru are a good example of the principles on which she bases her development cooperation: In an increasingly multipolar world, she said, support for poorer countries must be given on an equal footing, otherwise many countries will turn to Russia or China, which often cooperate on the basis of geopolitical interests: \"The countries of Asia, Africa, and Latin America are rightly becoming increasingly self-confident. They choose their partners. And it is our task to remain a strong partner in this new, multipolar world.\"\nAccording to the minister, another priority over the past three years has been the attempt to develop projects that are more strongly feminist in their approach. And this is another issue for which the ministry has repeatedly been criticized. Schulze announced a goal that by 2025, at least 93% of all projects approved will be designed to promote gender equality. In 2022, this was only the case for 66% of projects, whereas in 2024 it rose to around 91%.\nThe Development Policy Report is published once per legislative period and primarily serves to provide the Bundestag with an overview of development policy. Despite all of her efforts, it remains uncertain whether the SPD politician Schulze will be able to continue her work. Now that the FDP has left the government, the Social Democrats and the Greens are governing as a minority government.\nAnd a new Bundestag will be elected on February 23. Svenja Schulze's party, the SPD, is currently far behind the conservatives in the polls.\nThis article was originally written in German.\nWhile you're here: Every Tuesday, DW editors round up what is happening in German politics and society.

Key lawmakers from the Green Party and Social Democrats aim to repeal the longstanding paragraph 218, which restricts abortion. Although the requirement for counseling will remain, the mandatory three-day waiting period will be eliminated. Conservative opposition is strong, particularly from the Christian Democrats, who argue the proposal could polarize society. Supporters argue that current laws are outdated and disproportionately affect low-income women. The initiative is seen as a critical step in reforming abortion access in Germany.",
            "content": "A left-wing cross-party initiative in Germany has been launched to decriminalize abortion in the early stages of pregnancy. Polls show public support, but conservative lawmakers are opposed.\nLawmakers from Germany's center-left parties want to make abortion legal in Germany \u2014 in the first three months of pregnancy.\nGermany's paragraph 218 outlawing abortions first entered the statute books in 1871 and has long been controversial. While abortion remains illegal, women since the 1990s\u00a0have been permitted to have them within the first three months of pregnancy without risk of prosecution if they undergo counseling at least three days before the procedure. Terminations in the case of rape or when the woman's mental or physical health is at risk are also exempt from punishment.\nUlle Schauws from the Green Party and Carmen Wegge from the center-left Social Democrats (SPD) are spearheading moves to abolish paragraph 218 before the end of this legislative period in February 2025.\nThe requirement for obligatory counseling is being retained in a bid to garner more cross-party support. However, the three-day wait following the counseling would be abolished.\nChancellor Olaf Scholz (SPD) has signed the proposal, drawing fierce criticism from his main opponent in the upcoming election campaign.\nChristian Democrat leader Friedrich Merz, a Catholic conservative, has come out vociferously against the SPD-Green initiative, describing it as an \"affront to the people.\" He said it was a subject that \"polarized the country like no other and that was more likely than any other to unleash another completely unnecessary social conflict in Germany.\"\nPolls, however, suggest strong public support for decriminalization. Seventy-four percent came out in favor of unrestricted access to abortion in the first three months of pregnancy in the latest RTL/ntv-Trend Barometer survey.\nMedics who perform abortions are retiring. Medical students are not routinely taught how to perform the surgical procedure. Since 2003 the number of doctors' practices providing abortions has almost halved. The situation is particularly difficult across swathes of southern Germany meaning longer journeys for some.\nHowever, when the center-left coalition government of SPD, Greens and the neoliberal Free Democrats (FDP) came to office in 2021, it vowed\u00a0to make reforms.\nIn 2022, lawmakers repealed paragraph 219a of the criminal code, known as the ban on advertising abortion. Under that law which had its origins in Nazi-era social policy, anyone who publicly \"offers, announces [or] advertises\" abortion services can face penalties of up to two years' imprisonment or a fine.\nFor doctors, the legal red tape, threat of prosecution, and possible harassment by anti-abortion rights campaigners also create a huge disincentive, according to Stephanie Schlitt, vice chairperson for Pro Familia, an independent body for planned parenthood which has been calling for legislative change since the 1970s.\nThere has also recently been a ban on what is known as sidewalk harassment making it a misdemeanor for anti-abortion activists to aggressively protest near counseling centers, hospitals, or doctors' offices that offer pregnancy counseling or carry out abortions.\nTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video\nAbortion\u00a0remains a fraught process, according to Schlitt, involving high costs, complex paperwork, and stigma.\u00a0Abortion costs are not generally covered by health insurance companies\nAbortion pills are only allowed in Germany up to 49 days after conception.\nIn April 2024, a government-appointed commission of 18 medical, and ethical experts concluded that criminalization was no longer tenable under constitutional, international, and European law. However, its recommendations were shelved after pushback from some members of the FDP, which is now no longer part of the government.\nFDP lawmaker Katrin Helling-Plahr has voiced her opposition to the latest initiative. She told katholisch.de, the online portal of the Roman Catholic church in Germany that she thought it was inappropriate \"to throw such a complex topic in front of parliament in the final meters.\" But the FDP youth organization has written to all FDP parliamentarians calling for the debate to go ahead.\nProFamilia vice-chair Stephanie Schlitt criticized political attempts to portray the new cross-party initiative as a rush job. \"This step is long overdue. Germany has one of the most restrictive laws regarding abortions in Europe,\" Schlitt told DW.\nFierce opposition is likely to come not only from the CDU/CSU bloc but also from the far right. In its election manifesto, the Alternative for Germany (AfD) takes a 'pro-life' position, prioritizing the protection of the unborn child and rejecting any state support for abortion.\nThe new SPD-Green proposals are backed by the Left Party, which demands the removal of paragraph 218 from the criminal code and the provision of free contraception in its manifesto. It says current hurdles are incompatible with women's rights to self-determination \u2014 and disproportionately affect low-income groups. Schauws said she believed the new left-wing populist party Sahra Wagenknecht Alliance (BSW) would either abstain or support the initiative.\nWith a likely shift to the right expected after the next elections, ProFamilia vice-chair Stephanie Schlitt sees \"a historic window of opportunity.\" And she warned: \"The polarization of society is more likely if the law remains as it is because women, child bearers, see that their interests do not count.\"\nIf the proposal is put to parliament, the vote will be an open one.\u00a0It might see\u00a0the CDU/CSU and the AfD voting together\u00a0to oppose it \u2014 a dilemma for the CDU/CSU, as it has previously refused to cooperate with the AfD.\nEdited by: Rina Goldenberg\nWhile you're here: Every Tuesday, DW editors round up what is happening in German politics and society.

Moreover, and potentially more ominously, French Prime Minister Michel Barnier has said Paris would not agree to the deal in its current form.\n\"The agreement between Mercosur and the EU is far more advantageous to Europe than it is to South America,\" as Raul Montenegro, an Argentine biologist and 2004 Right Livelihood Award winner, told DW. \"The main losers in an eventual agreement will definitely be biological diversity in South America, as well as the small and midsized businesses and poor in both regions.\"\nTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video\nG20 host Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, who hopes to enshrine the fight against hunger and climate change in the Rio summit's final communique, is facing a herculean task when it comes to the endless discussion of free-trade agreements, yet remains upbeat.\n\"I have never been so optimistic about the EU-Mercosur,\" the Brazilian president said on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly in New York in September.

The first vote shapes half of the Bundestag's composition, while the second determines party strength. Starting in 2025, the Bundestag will be limited to 630 seats, following a reform to manage the number of lawmakers.

            "content": "On the surface, the German electoral system is similar to that of most other Western countries, although it does have its own quirks and peculiarities. DW explains.\nWhen Germans go to their polling stations \u2014 in schools and other public buildings \u2014 they have two votes: One for a candidate to represent their constituency and the second for a party's state list, which usually lists between 10 and 30 candidates. The system is often referred to as \"personalized proportional representation.\"\nThe first vote, for a direct candidate\u00a0running in the respective electoral district, determines half of the parliament's total composition, ensuring that each district is represented.\nThe second vote determines the strength of the parties in the lower House of Parliament, the Bundestag and thereby determines how many candidates from that state list will be granted seats in the Bundestag.\nFrom 2025, the number of seats in parliament will be limited to 630 seats. A reform to the election system was introduced in 2024, doing away with provisions that made the number of lawmakers balloon as the size of parties shrank. This reform was partially overturned by the top court.\nTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video\nAround 61\u00a0million of Germany's 83 million population are eligible to vote. These are German nationals aged 18 and over. If they have lived in the country for at least three consecutive\u00a0months in the last 25 years, German nationals who live abroad can vote by\u00a0post. The website of Germany's Federal Returning Officer does not ban embassies or consulates from maintaining ballot boxes but says it would involve a \"disproportionate amount of effort.\"\nThe right to vote may be revoked by a court for individuals who committed certain political crimes \u2014 like espionage and disclosure of state secrets \u2014 but under no circumstances in the case of crimes such as murder, manslaughter and serious sexual abuse of children.\nThe same rules apply to the candidates\u00a0who their respective parties put forward.\nJust over half of the electorate are women, almost 40% are age 60 and above\u00a0and 14% are younger than 30.\nVoter turnout tends to be high in Germany. In\u00a0the last two general elections, it has been just over 76%.\nUnder German election law, parties must obtain a minimum of 5%\u00a0of the party votes (second votes) to secure representation. The provision was first introduced in 1953 and was intended to prevent tiny splinter parties like those that plagued the Weimar Republic from entering into parliament and fragmenting it, making it hard to form a viable majority.\nHowever, an exception is granted to parties that field winning candidates in at least three electoral districts: winning three individual mandates lifts the 5%\u00a0threshold for the respective party. In 2021, for example, this applied to the Left Party, which won only 4.9% of the second votes but was allowed to fill 4.9% of the seats and send 39 lawmakers because three of their candidates won in their constituencies.\nThe second exception is for candidates representing\u00a0a recognized German minority, like the Danish in Schleswig-Holstein or the Sorbs in Saxony. It takes between 35,000 and 38,000 votes to win a constituency, so that is the number of votes a representative of a minority party needs to garner to get a seat in the Bundestag. In 2021, Stefan Seidler, the representative of the Danish minority, won 55,000 votes securing a seat in parliament.\nIf a party gains 50% of the vote it would then effectively have representatives to push through its own agenda. But that is unlikely to happen. For that reason, parties in Germany usually need to partner with one or more parties to build a coalition with enough votes to control the Bundestag.\nTraditionally, the candidate of the party gaining the most votes will become chancellor and the leading candidate of the junior coalition partner is often tapped to become foreign minister. The chancellor presents the names of the ministers and their portfolios to the president, who appoints the members of government.\nAny German citizen who is at least 18 years old can become chancellor. A seat in the Bundestag is not necessary, but he or she\u00a0needs to garner a majority of lawmakers' votes.\nThe Basic Law, the German constitution,\u00a0stipulates that the first session of the new Bundestag must take place within 30 days after the election.\nThe president officially proposes the candidate for chancellor who then\u00a0needs to win an absolute majority of the votes (50+1). If the candidate fails to achieve this, the members of the Bundestag can pick another candidate and put him or her to a vote within a fortnight. Again, an absolute majority is required.\nIf no candidate wins an absolute majority in the second round of voting, a final ballot is held immediately. Whoever receives the most votes in that round\u00a0is elected by simple majority.\nIf the chancellor is elected with an absolute majority, the president must appoint him or her within seven days. If the elected person only achieved a simple majority in the third round, the president must either appoint him or her within seven days or dissolve the Bundestag, triggering new elections within 60 days.\nAccording to Germany's election review law, every individual eligible to vote in Germany can contest the validity of the election, as can groups of people eligible to vote. After each general election, there are hundreds of challenges to the results.\nObjections must be made in writing\u00a0to the election review commission with the Bundestag in Berlin within two months of election day.\nThe election review commission processes all submissions. A decision is made on each individual challenge, and each objector receives written feedback from the Bundestag.\nTo invalidate the results of a Bundestag election, an objection must meet two requirements. First, there must be an electoral error that violates the Federal Election Act, the Federal Election Code\u00a0or the constitution. Secondly, the reported electoral error would have to have an impact on the distribution of seats in the Bundestag.\nThe commission needs about a year to process all appeals. Less than 4% of those cases reached the Constitutional Court. A German national vote has never been declared invalid.\nUnder normal circumstances, elections happen again four years later, and then it's back to square one.\nThis article has been updated to reflect the regulations as they apply to the general election in February 2025.",

            "summary": "Elon Musk's recent comments and actions regarding Germany's far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) party have provoked significant backlash, leading the German government to label his remarks as potential election interference. Musk's support included an op-ed in a German newspaper and a discussion with AfD leader Alice Weidel, which critics argue could normalize a party linked to extremism. Legal experts suggest these activities might qualify as illegal party donations due to Musk's ownership of X (formerly Twitter). Polls indicate Musk's influence may not significantly boost AfD's voter support ahead of the February elections.",
            "content": "Skip to comments.\nPosted on 01/10/2025 10:36:41 AM PST by nickcarraway\nThe tech billionaire\u2019s comments online have caused Germany\u2019s government to claim he was \u2018interfering\u2019 in the country\u2019s upcoming elections \u2013 but it's unclear yet if his efforts would have a substantial impact on the vote\u2019s outcome. South African-born tech billionaire Elon Musk caused a stir in the German political establishment shortly before Christmas when he boldly claimed \u201conly the AfD can save Germany\u201d \u2014 right at the start of a tense election campaign to select the country\u2019s new government. Despite rebukes from German politicians \u2014 some of whom compared Musk to Russian President Vladimir Putin \u2014 the owner of X, Tesla and SpaceX doubled down on his comments and published an op-ed supporting the party in the country\u2019s Welt am Sontag newspaper. Several weeks later, he hosted a live discussion on X with the far-right AfD\u2019s candidate for chancellor, Alice Weidel. The AfD, or Alternative for Germany, is officially classified as a suspected extremist organisation in Germany. Other parties have traditionally shunned it due to their member\u2019s extreme views and association with neo-Nazi organisations. The decision to publish Musk\u2019s op-ed sparked fierce debate within Germany, with critics arguing it was a step closer to normalising a party that for years has been deemed too extreme to work with, even among Europe\u2019s other far-right groups with which it is more ideologically aligned. Despite this, others say that Musk\u2019s contributions might not translate into more votes for the AfD in Germany\u2019s elections on 23 February. A recent Forsa poll suggested that, although the AfD is polling over 20%, voting intention has been steady since the start of 2024. The poll shows the AfD is actually several percentage points lower \u2014 at 19% \u2014 than it was at the same time last year. Is Musk allowed to promote the AfD? Musk\u2019s comments provoked a backlash and even a response from the German Chancellor himself, who told Stern magazine, \u201cDon\u2019t feed the troll\u201d as Musk directed a barrage of insults at the leader. In another speech, the government said that Musk\u2019s comments amounted to \u201celection interference\u201d. However, it\u2019s unclear whether Musk\u2019s promotion of the AfD could be considered interference \u2014 at least not in a way in which legal action could be brought against him. Outwardly, unless his statements involved insults, slander, or incitement to hatred, he would be protected by freedom of expression. The situation becomes more complex if Musk or the company he owns, X, actively advertises the AfD. According to legal expert Aurel Eschmann from NGO Lobby Control, the live space hosted between Musk and Weidel could count as an illegal party donation. \u201cIt's not the interview itself that would be an illegal party donation, otherwise many media formats would be a party donation, but the reach that the platform gives as you can buy boosts there for your own posts,\u201d Eschmann told Euronews. \u201cMusk is not just a user who has many followers on X, he is the owner of the platform. There is alot of evidence his posts are artificially gaining reach for all users on the platform, even those who don\u2019t follow him.\u201d Germany's far-right AfD chief pushes back on Nazi claims in chat with Elon Musk on X Data from the Bundesdatenschau, a team of data scientists that tracks the number of impressions on X posts, shows that Weidel's average post has reached 1 million impressions in the last two weeks \u2014 an enormous increase from her average impressions for the last twelve months, which were under 200,000. If Musk\u2019s live space for the AfD would be considered an illegal party donation under German law, the Bundestag would be required to investigate, according to Eschmann. Advertisements for the party could also include deliberately manipulating the algorithm to favour the AfD\u2019s posts, yet Musk himself has repeatedly denied that the algorithm is manipulated to promote content that he favours. However, a study from the Queensland University of Technology indicates that his own posts during the US election saw a sudden increase in views and engagement. As part of European officials assessing the legality of Musk\u2019s contributions on the platform, his conversation with Weidel on X has also been included in an ongoing probe launched by the European Commission into the platform on whether the discussion violates the EU\u2019s Digital Services Act. Could Musk make a financial donation to the AfD? Musk funnelled millions into US President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s campaign through his super Political Action Committee (PAC). However, German law would prevent Musk from making a substantial financial donation to the AfD, as donations to German parties from outside the EU are limited to a maximum of 1,000, a spokesperson from the Interior Ministry confirmed to Euronews. On top of this, parties in Germany must report single donations exceeding \u20ac50,000 to the president of the German Bundestag. High campaign donations such as those in the US are unusual in Germany: the AfD has not received a single official donation of over \u20ac35,000 in its history. Related EU Commission to add Musk\u2019s German AfD interview to ongoing platform probe However, if Musk was motivated to financially donate to the AfD, he could find a loophole by donating to an association or a \u201cVerein,\u201d which is allowed to collect donations over time and give them to political parties directly or through advertising, Eschmann said. \u201cThere are more opaque \u2018Verein\u2019 constructions he could use, Tesla Germany might be an option. You would have to take a closer look to see if that wouldn\u2019t be possible. It just shows the German system is not prepared or set up for this kind of influence,\u201d Eschmann explained. The AfD has also been previously accused, alongside other political parties, of raising funds through shadowy means. This included allegedly benefiting from an illegal \u20ac6 million advertising campaign between 2016 and 2018 via a shell company in Switzerland, which paid for \u201cseveral thousand posters,\u201d among other advertisements for the party. Could he influence voters? Musk has 211.4 million followers on X and the ability to reach people across the world with his opinions. Experts imagine that he could have some impact online by tapping into voters who are dissatisfied with the current German government; however, it\u2019s currently too early to tell. \u201dMusk could have some impact because there is a general kind of dissatisfaction in Germany with the lack of digitalisation, bureaucracy, the economic crisis,\u201d Philipp David Darius, a postdoctoral researcher at the Centre for Digital Governance, said. \u201cI imagine he could have some impact on legitimising the AfD\u2019s opinions to those who are more liberal leaning. Perhaps some people would see him as having this entrepreneurial charisma.\u201d More critical in shifting public opinion in Germany, Darius said, is Musk\u2019s influence on tech entrepreneurs such as Mark Zuckerberg, who recently announced he was rolling back on fact-checkers on his Meta platforms in favour of a community notes style system practised on X. A 2023 study by public broadcaster ARD showed that only 8% of Germans use X daily, with most Germans favouring Instagram (35%) and Facebook (33%), both owned by Meta. \u201cLess content moderation on X and other platforms could have implications for what content is visible to voters. Additionally, the amplification of misinformation and negative content about rival parties such as the Greens could have repercussions for their voter support, even if it doesn\u2019t gain the AfD more votes,\u201d Darius said. Recent polling doesn\u2019t indicate that Musk has won the AfD a vast influx of new votes, at least not yet. \u201cIt\u2019s very difficult to draw causal connections between people reading something online and changing their opinion,\u201d Matthias Kettemann from the Humboldt Institute for Internet and Society said. \u201cIf you look at the AfD\u2019s results in the last election, I don\u2019t think voters of the AfD would need Musk to certify the validity of their opinions, although it certainly doesn\u2019t hurt them that he approves of them.\u201d More wide-reaching in Germany itself, Kettemann explained, was the decision by Welt to publish an op-ed with Musk and the subsequent fall-out. \u201cI think that the actions of Elon Musk contribute to a polarisation of the political discourse.\u201d \u201cThe fact that Musk is trying to influence the political process is already influencing it simply through this feeling that we might not be able to trust how X regulates content around the election,\u201d he told Euronews. Musk often justifies his comments online as an act of free speech. Kettemann pointed out that there are differences in the US and European contexts regarding what is allowed under the right to freedom of speech, which is called freedom of expression in European law. \u201cThere are limits to that freedom of speech, especially the European context. If you look at the European Convention on Human Rights there is the freedom of expression but that freedom of expression can be limited through laws that relate to securing a different societal value such as the rights of others or public health or democracy,\u201d Kettemann explained. \u201cEvery individual has the right to free speech, but that also comes with responsibilities. Especially when you are a powerful actor.\u201d\n\nTOPICS: Culture/Society; Foreign Affairs; News/Current Events; Politics/Elections\nKEYWORDS: election; elonmusk; germany\n\n\n\n\n1\nposted on 01/10/2025 10:36:41 AM PST\nby nickcarraway\n\n[\nPost Reply\n | Private Reply\n | View Replies]\n\nTo: nickcarraway\n\nThe elites in Europe sure seem to be scared of Musk.

Maybe 10-to-15 percent will flip-flop around in each cycle.\nSo Elon\u2019s actions have minimum value.

Beyond that...it won\u2019t change.\nOne other factor...migration is only one of the top five topics.

Several weeks later, he hosted a live discussion on X with the far-right AfD\u2019s candidate for chancellor, Alice Weidel. The AfD, or Alternative for Germany, is officially classified as a suspected extremist organisation in Germany. Other parties have traditionally shunned it due to their member\u2019s extreme views and association with neo-Nazi organisations. The decision to publish Musk\u2019s op-ed sparked fierce debate within Germany, with critics arguing it was a step closer to normalising a party that for years has been deemed too extreme to work with, even among Europe\u2019s other far-right groups with which it is more ideologically aligned. Despite this, others say that Musk\u2019s contributions might not translate into more votes for the AfD in Germany\u2019s elections on 23 February. A recent Forsa poll suggested that, although the AfD is polling over 20%, voting intention has been steady since the start of 2024. The poll shows the AfD is actually several percentage points lower \u2014 at 19% \u2014 than it was at the same time last year. Is Musk allowed to promote the AfD? Musk\u2019s comments provoked a backlash and even a response from the German Chancellor himself, who told Stern magazine, \u201cDon\u2019t feed the troll\u201d as Musk directed a barrage of insults at the leader. In another speech, the government said that Musk\u2019s comments amounted to \u201celection interference\u201d. However, it\u2019s unclear whether Musk\u2019s promotion of the AfD could be considered interference \u2014 at least not in a way in which legal action could be brought against him. Outwardly, unless his statements involved insults, slander, or incitement to hatred, he would be protected by freedom of expression. The situation becomes more complex if Musk or the company he owns, X, actively advertises the AfD. According to legal expert Aurel Eschmann from NGO Lobby Control, the live space hosted between Musk and Weidel could count as an illegal party donation. \u201cIt's not the interview itself that would be an illegal party donation, otherwise many media formats would be a party donation, but the reach that the platform gives as you can buy boosts there for your own posts,\u201d Eschmann told Euronews. \u201cMusk is not just a user who has many followers on X, he is the owner of the platform. There is alot of evidence his posts are artificially gaining reach for all users on the platform, even those who don\u2019t follow him.\u201d Germany's far-right AfD chief pushes back on Nazi claims in chat with Elon Musk on X Data from the Bundesdatenschau, a team of data scientists that tracks the number of impressions on X posts, shows that Weidel's average post has reached 1 million impressions in the last two weeks \u2014 an enormous increase from her average impressions for the last twelve months, which were under 200,000. If Musk\u2019s live space for the AfD would be considered an illegal party donation under German law, the Bundestag would be required to investigate, according to Eschmann. Advertisements for the party could also include deliberately manipulating the algorithm to favour the AfD\u2019s posts, yet Musk himself has repeatedly denied that the algorithm is manipulated to promote content that he favours. However, a study from the Queensland University of Technology indicates that his own posts during the US election saw a sudden increase in views and engagement. As part of European officials assessing the legality of Musk\u2019s contributions on the platform, his conversation with Weidel on X has also been included in an ongoing probe launched by the European Commission into the platform on whether the discussion violates the EU\u2019s Digital Services Act. Could Musk make a financial donation to the AfD? Musk funnelled millions into US President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s campaign through his super Political Action Committee (PAC). However, German law would prevent Musk from making a substantial financial donation to the AfD, as donations to German parties from outside the EU are limited to a maximum of 1,000, a spokesperson from the Interior Ministry confirmed to Euronews. On top of this, parties in Germany must report single donations exceeding \u20ac50,000 to the president of the German Bundestag. High campaign donations such as those in the US are unusual in Germany: the AfD has not received a single official donation of over \u20ac35,000 in its history. Related EU Commission to add Musk\u2019s German AfD interview to ongoing platform probe However, if Musk was motivated to financially donate to the AfD, he could find a loophole by donating to an association or a \u201cVerein,\u201d which is allowed to collect donations over time and give them to political parties directly or through advertising, Eschmann said. \u201cThere are more opaque \u2018Verein\u2019 constructions he could use, Tesla Germany might be an option. You would have to take a closer look to see if that wouldn\u2019t be possible. It just shows the German system is not prepared or set up for this kind of influence,\u201d Eschmann explained. The AfD has also been previously accused, alongside other political parties, of raising funds through shadowy means. This included allegedly benefiting from an illegal \u20ac6 million advertising campaign between 2016 and 2018 via a shell company in Switzerland, which paid for \u201cseveral thousand posters,\u201d among other advertisements for the party. Could he influence voters? Musk has 211.4 million followers on X and the ability to reach people across the world with his opinions. Experts imagine that he could have some impact online by tapping into voters who are dissatisfied with the current German government; however, it\u2019s currently too early to tell. \u201dMusk could have some impact because there is a general kind of dissatisfaction in Germany with the lack of digitalisation, bureaucracy, the economic crisis,\u201d Philipp David Darius, a postdoctoral researcher at the Centre for Digital Governance, said. \u201cI imagine he could have some impact on legitimising the AfD\u2019s opinions to those who are more liberal leaning. Perhaps some people would see him as having this entrepreneurial charisma.\u201d More critical in shifting public opinion in Germany, Darius said, is Musk\u2019s influence on tech entrepreneurs such as Mark Zuckerberg, who recently announced he was rolling back on fact-checkers on his Meta platforms in favour of a community notes style system practised on X. A 2023 study by public broadcaster ARD showed that only 8% of Germans use X daily, with most Germans favouring Instagram (35%) and Facebook (33%), both owned by Meta. \u201cLess content moderation on X and other platforms could have implications for what content is visible to voters. Additionally, the amplification of misinformation and negative content about rival parties such as the Greens could have repercussions for their voter support, even if it doesn\u2019t gain the AfD more votes,\u201d Darius said. Recent polling doesn\u2019t indicate that Musk has won the AfD a vast influx of new votes, at least not yet. \u201cIt\u2019s very difficult to draw causal connections between people reading something online and changing their opinion,\u201d Matthias Kettemann from the Humboldt Institute for Internet and Society said. \u201cIf you look at the AfD\u2019s results in the last election, I don\u2019t think voters of the AfD would need Musk to certify the validity of their opinions, although it certainly doesn\u2019t hurt them that he approves of them.\u201d More wide-reaching in Germany itself, Kettemann explained, was the decision by Welt to publish an op-ed with Musk and the subsequent fall-out. \u201cI think that the actions of Elon Musk contribute to a polarisation of the political discourse.\u201d \u201cThe fact that Musk is trying to influence the political process is already influencing it simply through this feeling that we might not be able to trust how X regulates content around the election,\u201d he told Euronews. Musk often justifies his comments online as an act of free speech. Kettemann pointed out that there are differences in the US and European contexts regarding what is allowed under the right to freedom of speech, which is called freedom of expression in European law. \u201cThere are limits to that freedom of speech, especially the European context. If you look at the European Convention on Human Rights there is the freedom of expression but that freedom of expression can be limited through laws that relate to securing a different societal value such as the rights of others or public health or democracy,\u201d Kettemann explained. \u201cEvery individual has the right to free speech, but that also comes with responsibilities. Especially when you are a powerful actor.\u201d\n\nTOPICS: Culture/Society; Foreign Affairs; News/Current Events; Politics/Elections\nKEYWORDS: election; elonmusk; germany\n\n\n\n\n1\nposted on 01/10/2025 10:36:41 AM PST\nby nickcarraway\n\n[\nPost Reply\n | Private Reply\n | View Replies]\n\nTo: nickcarraway\n\nThe elites in Europe sure seem to be scared of Musk.

Recent polling doesn\u2019t indicate that Musk has won the AfD a vast influx of new votes, at least not yet. \u201cIt\u2019s very difficult to draw causal connections between people reading something online and changing their opinion,\u201d Matthias Kettemann from the Humboldt Institute for Internet and Society said. \u201cIf you look at the AfD\u2019s results in the last election, I don\u2019t think voters of the AfD would need Musk to certify the validity of their opinions, although it certainly doesn\u2019t hurt them that he approves of them.\u201d More wide-reaching in Germany itself, Kettemann explained, was the decision by Welt to publish an op-ed with Musk and the subsequent fall-out. \u201cI think that the actions of Elon Musk contribute to a polarisation of the political discourse.\u201d \u201cThe fact that Musk is trying to influence the political process is already influencing it simply through this feeling that we might not be able to trust how X regulates content around the election,\u201d he told Euronews. Musk often justifies his comments online as an act of free speech. Kettemann pointed out that there are differences in the US and European contexts regarding what is allowed under the right to freedom of speech, which is called freedom of expression in European law. \u201cThere are limits to that freedom of speech, especially the European context. If you look at the European Convention on Human Rights there is the freedom of expression but that freedom of expression can be limited through laws that relate to securing a different societal value such as the rights of others or public health or democracy,\u201d Kettemann explained. \u201cEvery individual has the right to free speech, but that also comes with responsibilities. Especially when you are a powerful actor.\u201d\n\nTOPICS: Culture/Society; Foreign Affairs; News/Current Events; Politics/Elections\nKEYWORDS: election; elonmusk; germany\n\n\n\n\n1\nposted on 01/10/2025 10:36:41 AM PST\nby nickcarraway\n\n[\nPost Reply\n | Private Reply\n | View Replies]\n\nTo: nickcarraway\n\nThe elites in Europe sure seem to be scared of Musk.

Other parties have traditionally shunned it due to their member\u2019s extreme views and association with neo-Nazi organisations. The decision to publish Musk\u2019s op-ed sparked fierce debate within Germany, with critics arguing it was a step closer to normalising a party that for years has been deemed too extreme to work with, even among Europe\u2019s other far-right groups with which it is more ideologically aligned. Despite this, others say that Musk\u2019s contributions might not translate into more votes for the AfD in Germany\u2019s elections on 23 February. A recent Forsa poll suggested that, although the AfD is polling over 20%, voting intention has been steady since the start of 2024. The poll shows the AfD is actually several percentage points lower \u2014 at 19% \u2014 than it was at the same time last year. Is Musk allowed to promote the AfD? Musk\u2019s comments provoked a backlash and even a response from the German Chancellor himself, who told Stern magazine, \u201cDon\u2019t feed the troll\u201d as Musk directed a barrage of insults at the leader. In another speech, the government said that Musk\u2019s comments amounted to \u201celection interference\u201d. However, it\u2019s unclear whether Musk\u2019s promotion of the AfD could be considered interference \u2014 at least not in a way in which legal action could be brought against him. Outwardly, unless his statements involved insults, slander, or incitement to hatred, he would be protected by freedom of expression. The situation becomes more complex if Musk or the company he owns, X, actively advertises the AfD. According to legal expert Aurel Eschmann from NGO Lobby Control, the live space hosted between Musk and Weidel could count as an illegal party donation. \u201cIt's not the interview itself that would be an illegal party donation, otherwise many media formats would be a party donation, but the reach that the platform gives as you can buy boosts there for your own posts,\u201d Eschmann told Euronews. \u201cMusk is not just a user who has many followers on X, he is the owner of the platform. There is alot of evidence his posts are artificially gaining reach for all users on the platform, even those who don\u2019t follow him.\u201d Germany's far-right AfD chief pushes back on Nazi claims in chat with Elon Musk on X Data from the Bundesdatenschau, a team of data scientists that tracks the number of impressions on X posts, shows that Weidel's average post has reached 1 million impressions in the last two weeks \u2014 an enormous increase from her average impressions for the last twelve months, which were under 200,000. If Musk\u2019s live space for the AfD would be considered an illegal party donation under German law, the Bundestag would be required to investigate, according to Eschmann. Advertisements for the party could also include deliberately manipulating the algorithm to favour the AfD\u2019s posts, yet Musk himself has repeatedly denied that the algorithm is manipulated to promote content that he favours. However, a study from the Queensland University of Technology indicates that his own posts during the US election saw a sudden increase in views and engagement. As part of European officials assessing the legality of Musk\u2019s contributions on the platform, his conversation with Weidel on X has also been included in an ongoing probe launched by the European Commission into the platform on whether the discussion violates the EU\u2019s Digital Services Act. Could Musk make a financial donation to the AfD? Musk funnelled millions into US President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s campaign through his super Political Action Committee (PAC). However, German law would prevent Musk from making a substantial financial donation to the AfD, as donations to German parties from outside the EU are limited to a maximum of 1,000, a spokesperson from the Interior Ministry confirmed to Euronews. On top of this, parties in Germany must report single donations exceeding \u20ac50,000 to the president of the German Bundestag. High campaign donations such as those in the US are unusual in Germany: the AfD has not received a single official donation of over \u20ac35,000 in its history. Related EU Commission to add Musk\u2019s German AfD interview to ongoing platform probe However, if Musk was motivated to financially donate to the AfD, he could find a loophole by donating to an association or a \u201cVerein,\u201d which is allowed to collect donations over time and give them to political parties directly or through advertising, Eschmann said. \u201cThere are more opaque \u2018Verein\u2019 constructions he could use, Tesla Germany might be an option. You would have to take a closer look to see if that wouldn\u2019t be possible. It just shows the German system is not prepared or set up for this kind of influence,\u201d Eschmann explained. The AfD has also been previously accused, alongside other political parties, of raising funds through shadowy means. This included allegedly benefiting from an illegal \u20ac6 million advertising campaign between 2016 and 2018 via a shell company in Switzerland, which paid for \u201cseveral thousand posters,\u201d among other advertisements for the party. Could he influence voters? Musk has 211.4 million followers on X and the ability to reach people across the world with his opinions. Experts imagine that he could have some impact online by tapping into voters who are dissatisfied with the current German government; however, it\u2019s currently too early to tell. \u201dMusk could have some impact because there is a general kind of dissatisfaction in Germany with the lack of digitalisation, bureaucracy, the economic crisis,\u201d Philipp David Darius, a postdoctoral researcher at the Centre for Digital Governance, said. \u201cI imagine he could have some impact on legitimising the AfD\u2019s opinions to those who are more liberal leaning. Perhaps some people would see him as having this entrepreneurial charisma.\u201d More critical in shifting public opinion in Germany, Darius said, is Musk\u2019s influence on tech entrepreneurs such as Mark Zuckerberg, who recently announced he was rolling back on fact-checkers on his Meta platforms in favour of a community notes style system practised on X. A 2023 study by public broadcaster ARD showed that only 8% of Germans use X daily, with most Germans favouring Instagram (35%) and Facebook (33%), both owned by Meta. \u201cLess content moderation on X and other platforms could have implications for what content is visible to voters.

Recent polling doesn\u2019t indicate that Musk has won the AfD a vast influx of new votes, at least not yet. \u201cIt\u2019s very difficult to draw causal connections between people reading something online and changing their opinion,\u201d Matthias Kettemann from the Humboldt Institute for Internet and Society said. \u201cIf you look at the AfD\u2019s results in the last election, I don\u2019t think voters of the AfD would need Musk to certify the validity of their opinions, although it certainly doesn\u2019t hurt them that he approves of them.\u201d More wide-reaching in Germany itself, Kettemann explained, was the decision by Welt to publish an op-ed with Musk and the subsequent fall-out. \u201cI think that the actions of Elon Musk contribute to a polarisation of the political discourse.\u201d \u201cThe fact that Musk is trying to influence the political process is already influencing it simply through this feeling that we might not be able to trust how X regulates content around the election,\u201d he told Euronews.

Perhaps some people would see him as having this entrepreneurial charisma.\u201d More critical in shifting public opinion in Germany, Darius said, is Musk\u2019s influence on tech entrepreneurs such as Mark Zuckerberg, who recently announced he was rolling back on fact-checkers on his Meta platforms in favour of a community notes style system practised on X. A 2023 study by public broadcaster ARD showed that only 8% of Germans use X daily, with most Germans favouring Instagram (35%) and Facebook (33%), both owned by Meta. \u201cLess content moderation on X and other platforms could have implications for what content is visible to voters. Additionally, the amplification of misinformation and negative content about rival parties such as the Greens could have repercussions for their voter support, even if it doesn\u2019t gain the AfD more votes,\u201d Darius said. Recent polling doesn\u2019t indicate that Musk has won the AfD a vast influx of new votes, at least not yet. \u201cIt\u2019s very difficult to draw causal connections between people reading something online and changing their opinion,\u201d Matthias Kettemann from the Humboldt Institute for Internet and Society said. \u201cIf you look at the AfD\u2019s results in the last election, I don\u2019t think voters of the AfD would need Musk to certify the validity of their opinions, although it certainly doesn\u2019t hurt them that he approves of them.\u201d More wide-reaching in Germany itself, Kettemann explained, was the decision by Welt to publish an op-ed with Musk and the subsequent fall-out. \u201cI think that the actions of Elon Musk contribute to a polarisation of the political discourse.\u201d \u201cThe fact that Musk is trying to influence the political process is already influencing it simply through this feeling that we might not be able to trust how X regulates content around the election,\u201d he told Euronews. Musk often justifies his comments online as an act of free speech. Kettemann pointed out that there are differences in the US and European contexts regarding what is allowed under the right to freedom of speech, which is called freedom of expression in European law. \u201cThere are limits to that freedom of speech, especially the European context. If you look at the European Convention on Human Rights there is the freedom of expression but that freedom of expression can be limited through laws that relate to securing a different societal value such as the rights of others or public health or democracy,\u201d Kettemann explained. \u201cEvery individual has the right to free speech, but that also comes with responsibilities. Especially when you are a powerful actor.\u201d\n\nTOPICS: Culture/Society; Foreign Affairs; News/Current Events; Politics/Elections\nKEYWORDS: election; elonmusk; germany\n\n\n\n\n1\nposted on 01/10/2025 10:36:41 AM PST\nby nickcarraway\n\n[\nPost Reply\n | Private Reply\n | View Replies]\n\nTo: nickcarraway\n\nThe elites in Europe sure seem to be scared of Musk.

A recent Forsa poll suggested that, although the AfD is polling over 20%, voting intention has been steady since the start of 2024. The poll shows the AfD is actually several percentage points lower \u2014 at 19% \u2014 than it was at the same time last year. Is Musk allowed to promote the AfD? Musk\u2019s comments provoked a backlash and even a response from the German Chancellor himself, who told Stern magazine, \u201cDon\u2019t feed the troll\u201d as Musk directed a barrage of insults at the leader. In another speech, the government said that Musk\u2019s comments amounted to \u201celection interference\u201d. However, it\u2019s unclear whether Musk\u2019s promotion of the AfD could be considered interference \u2014 at least not in a way in which legal action could be brought against him. Outwardly, unless his statements involved insults, slander, or incitement to hatred, he would be protected by freedom of expression. The situation becomes more complex if Musk or the company he owns, X, actively advertises the AfD. According to legal expert Aurel Eschmann from NGO Lobby Control, the live space hosted between Musk and Weidel could count as an illegal party donation. \u201cIt's not the interview itself that would be an illegal party donation, otherwise many media formats would be a party donation, but the reach that the platform gives as you can buy boosts there for your own posts,\u201d Eschmann told Euronews. \u201cMusk is not just a user who has many followers on X, he is the owner of the platform. There is alot of evidence his posts are artificially gaining reach for all users on the platform, even those who don\u2019t follow him.\u201d Germany's far-right AfD chief pushes back on Nazi claims in chat with Elon Musk on X Data from the Bundesdatenschau, a team of data scientists that tracks the number of impressions on X posts, shows that Weidel's average post has reached 1 million impressions in the last two weeks \u2014 an enormous increase from her average impressions for the last twelve months, which were under 200,000. If Musk\u2019s live space for the AfD would be considered an illegal party donation under German law, the Bundestag would be required to investigate, according to Eschmann. Advertisements for the party could also include deliberately manipulating the algorithm to favour the AfD\u2019s posts, yet Musk himself has repeatedly denied that the algorithm is manipulated to promote content that he favours. However, a study from the Queensland University of Technology indicates that his own posts during the US election saw a sudden increase in views and engagement. As part of European officials assessing the legality of Musk\u2019s contributions on the platform, his conversation with Weidel on X has also been included in an ongoing probe launched by the European Commission into the platform on whether the discussion violates the EU\u2019s Digital Services Act. Could Musk make a financial donation to the AfD? Musk funnelled millions into US President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s campaign through his super Political Action Committee (PAC). However, German law would prevent Musk from making a substantial financial donation to the AfD, as donations to German parties from outside the EU are limited to a maximum of 1,000, a spokesperson from the Interior Ministry confirmed to Euronews. On top of this, parties in Germany must report single donations exceeding \u20ac50,000 to the president of the German Bundestag. High campaign donations such as those in the US are unusual in Germany: the AfD has not received a single official donation of over \u20ac35,000 in its history. Related EU Commission to add Musk\u2019s German AfD interview to ongoing platform probe However, if Musk was motivated to financially donate to the AfD, he could find a loophole by donating to an association or a \u201cVerein,\u201d which is allowed to collect donations over time and give them to political parties directly or through advertising, Eschmann said. \u201cThere are more opaque \u2018Verein\u2019 constructions he could use, Tesla Germany might be an option. You would have to take a closer look to see if that wouldn\u2019t be possible. It just shows the German system is not prepared or set up for this kind of influence,\u201d Eschmann explained. The AfD has also been previously accused, alongside other political parties, of raising funds through shadowy means. This included allegedly benefiting from an illegal \u20ac6 million advertising campaign between 2016 and 2018 via a shell company in Switzerland, which paid for \u201cseveral thousand posters,\u201d among other advertisements for the party.

Perhaps some people would see him as having this entrepreneurial charisma.\u201d More critical in shifting public opinion in Germany, Darius said, is Musk\u2019s influence on tech entrepreneurs such as Mark Zuckerberg, who recently announced he was rolling back on fact-checkers on his Meta platforms in favour of a community notes style system practised on X. A 2023 study by public broadcaster ARD showed that only 8% of Germans use X daily, with most Germans favouring Instagram (35%) and Facebook (33%), both owned by Meta. \u201cLess content moderation on X and other platforms could have implications for what content is visible to voters. Additionally, the amplification of misinformation and negative content about rival parties such as the Greens could have repercussions for their voter support, even if it doesn\u2019t gain the AfD more votes,\u201d Darius said. Recent polling doesn\u2019t indicate that Musk has won the AfD a vast influx of new votes, at least not yet. \u201cIt\u2019s very difficult to draw causal connections between people reading something online and changing their opinion,\u201d Matthias Kettemann from the Humboldt Institute for Internet and Society said. \u201cIf you look at the AfD\u2019s results in the last election, I don\u2019t think voters of the AfD would need Musk to certify the validity of their opinions, although it certainly doesn\u2019t hurt them that he approves of them.\u201d More wide-reaching in Germany itself, Kettemann explained, was the decision by Welt to publish an op-ed with Musk and the subsequent fall-out. \u201cI think that the actions of Elon Musk contribute to a polarisation of the political discourse.\u201d \u201cThe fact that Musk is trying to influence the political process is already influencing it simply through this feeling that we might not be able to trust how X regulates content around the election,\u201d he told Euronews. Musk often justifies his comments online as an act of free speech. Kettemann pointed out that there are differences in the US and European contexts regarding what is allowed under the right to freedom of speech, which is called freedom of expression in European law. \u201cThere are limits to that freedom of speech, especially the European context. If you look at the European Convention on Human Rights there is the freedom of expression but that freedom of expression can be limited through laws that relate to securing a different societal value such as the rights of others or public health or democracy,\u201d Kettemann explained. \u201cEvery individual has the right to free speech, but that also comes with responsibilities. Especially when you are a powerful actor.\u201d\n\nTOPICS: Culture/Society; Foreign Affairs; News/Current Events; Politics/Elections\nKEYWORDS: election; elonmusk; germany\n\n\n\n\n1\nposted on 01/10/2025 10:36:41 AM PST\nby nickcarraway\n\n[\nPost Reply\n | Private Reply\n | View Replies]\n\nTo: nickcarraway\n\nThe elites in Europe sure seem to be scared of Musk.

Musk\u2019s comments provoked a backlash and even a response from the German Chancellor himself, who told Stern magazine, \u201cDon\u2019t feed the troll\u201d as Musk directed a barrage of insults at the leader. In another speech, the government said that Musk\u2019s comments amounted to \u201celection interference\u201d. However, it\u2019s unclear whether Musk\u2019s promotion of the AfD could be considered interference \u2014 at least not in a way in which legal action could be brought against him. Outwardly, unless his statements involved insults, slander, or incitement to hatred, he would be protected by freedom of expression. The situation becomes more complex if Musk or the company he owns, X, actively advertises the AfD. According to legal expert Aurel Eschmann from NGO Lobby Control, the live space hosted between Musk and Weidel could count as an illegal party donation. \u201cIt's not the interview itself that would be an illegal party donation, otherwise many media formats would be a party donation, but the reach that the platform gives as you can buy boosts there for your own posts,\u201d Eschmann told Euronews. \u201cMusk is not just a user who has many followers on X, he is the owner of the platform. There is alot of evidence his posts are artificially gaining reach for all users on the platform, even those who don\u2019t follow him.\u201d Germany's far-right AfD chief pushes back on Nazi claims in chat with Elon Musk on X Data from the Bundesdatenschau, a team of data scientists that tracks the number of impressions on X posts, shows that Weidel's average post has reached 1 million impressions in the last two weeks \u2014 an enormous increase from her average impressions for the last twelve months, which were under 200,000. If Musk\u2019s live space for the AfD would be considered an illegal party donation under German law, the Bundestag would be required to investigate, according to Eschmann. Advertisements for the party could also include deliberately manipulating the algorithm to favour the AfD\u2019s posts, yet Musk himself has repeatedly denied that the algorithm is manipulated to promote content that he favours. However, a study from the Queensland University of Technology indicates that his own posts during the US election saw a sudden increase in views and engagement. As part of European officials assessing the legality of Musk\u2019s contributions on the platform, his conversation with Weidel on X has also been included in an ongoing probe launched by the European Commission into the platform on whether the discussion violates the EU\u2019s Digital Services Act. Could Musk make a financial donation to the AfD? Musk funnelled millions into US President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s campaign through his super Political Action Committee (PAC). However, German law would prevent Musk from making a substantial financial donation to the AfD, as donations to German parties from outside the EU are limited to a maximum of 1,000, a spokesperson from the Interior Ministry confirmed to Euronews. On top of this, parties in Germany must report single donations exceeding \u20ac50,000 to the president of the German Bundestag. High campaign donations such as those in the US are unusual in Germany: the AfD has not received a single official donation of over \u20ac35,000 in its history. Related EU Commission to add Musk\u2019s German AfD interview to ongoing platform probe However, if Musk was motivated to financially donate to the AfD, he could find a loophole by donating to an association or a \u201cVerein,\u201d which is allowed to collect donations over time and give them to political parties directly or through advertising, Eschmann said. \u201cThere are more opaque \u2018Verein\u2019 constructions he could use, Tesla Germany might be an option. You would have to take a closer look to see if that wouldn\u2019t be possible. It just shows the German system is not prepared or set up for this kind of influence,\u201d Eschmann explained. The AfD has also been previously accused, alongside other political parties, of raising funds through shadowy means. This included allegedly benefiting from an illegal \u20ac6 million advertising campaign between 2016 and 2018 via a shell company in Switzerland, which paid for \u201cseveral thousand posters,\u201d among other advertisements for the party.

However, it\u2019s unclear whether Musk\u2019s promotion of the AfD could be considered interference \u2014 at least not in a way in which legal action could be brought against him. Outwardly, unless his statements involved insults, slander, or incitement to hatred, he would be protected by freedom of expression. The situation becomes more complex if Musk or the company he owns, X, actively advertises the AfD. According to legal expert Aurel Eschmann from NGO Lobby Control, the live space hosted between Musk and Weidel could count as an illegal party donation. \u201cIt's not the interview itself that would be an illegal party donation, otherwise many media formats would be a party donation, but the reach that the platform gives as you can buy boosts there for your own posts,\u201d Eschmann told Euronews. \u201cMusk is not just a user who has many followers on X, he is the owner of the platform. There is alot of evidence his posts are artificially gaining reach for all users on the platform, even those who don\u2019t follow him.\u201d Germany's far-right AfD chief pushes back on Nazi claims in chat with Elon Musk on X Data from the Bundesdatenschau, a team of data scientists that tracks the number of impressions on X posts, shows that Weidel's average post has reached 1 million impressions in the last two weeks \u2014 an enormous increase from her average impressions for the last twelve months, which were under 200,000. If Musk\u2019s live space for the AfD would be considered an illegal party donation under German law, the Bundestag would be required to investigate, according to Eschmann. Advertisements for the party could also include deliberately manipulating the algorithm to favour the AfD\u2019s posts, yet Musk himself has repeatedly denied that the algorithm is manipulated to promote content that he favours. However, a study from the Queensland University of Technology indicates that his own posts during the US election saw a sudden increase in views and engagement. As part of European officials assessing the legality of Musk\u2019s contributions on the platform, his conversation with Weidel on X has also been included in an ongoing probe launched by the European Commission into the platform on whether the discussion violates the EU\u2019s Digital Services Act. Could Musk make a financial donation to the AfD? Musk funnelled millions into US President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s campaign through his super Political Action Committee (PAC). However, German law would prevent Musk from making a substantial financial donation to the AfD, as donations to German parties from outside the EU are limited to a maximum of 1,000, a spokesperson from the Interior Ministry confirmed to Euronews. On top of this, parties in Germany must report single donations exceeding \u20ac50,000 to the president of the German Bundestag. High campaign donations such as those in the US are unusual in Germany: the AfD has not received a single official donation of over \u20ac35,000 in its history. Related EU Commission to add Musk\u2019s German AfD interview to ongoing platform probe However, if Musk was motivated to financially donate to the AfD, he could find a loophole by donating to an association or a \u201cVerein,\u201d which is allowed to collect donations over time and give them to political parties directly or through advertising, Eschmann said. \u201cThere are more opaque \u2018Verein\u2019 constructions he could use, Tesla Germany might be an option. You would have to take a closer look to see if that wouldn\u2019t be possible. It just shows the German system is not prepared or set up for this kind of influence,\u201d Eschmann explained. The AfD has also been previously accused, alongside other political parties, of raising funds through shadowy means. This included allegedly benefiting from an illegal \u20ac6 million advertising campaign between 2016 and 2018 via a shell company in Switzerland, which paid for \u201cseveral thousand posters,\u201d among other advertisements for the party. Could he influence voters? Musk has 211.4 million followers on X and the ability to reach people across the world with his opinions. Experts imagine that he could have some impact online by tapping into voters who are dissatisfied with the current German government; however, it\u2019s currently too early to tell. \u201dMusk could have some impact because there is a general kind of dissatisfaction in Germany with the lack of digitalisation, bureaucracy, the economic crisis,\u201d Philipp David Darius, a postdoctoral researcher at the Centre for Digital Governance, said. \u201cI imagine he could have some impact on legitimising the AfD\u2019s opinions to those who are more liberal leaning. Perhaps some people would see him as having this entrepreneurial charisma.\u201d More critical in shifting public opinion in Germany, Darius said, is Musk\u2019s influence on tech entrepreneurs such as Mark Zuckerberg, who recently announced he was rolling back on fact-checkers on his Meta platforms in favour of a community notes style system practised on X. A 2023 study by public broadcaster ARD showed that only 8% of Germans use X daily, with most Germans favouring Instagram (35%) and Facebook (33%), both owned by Meta. \u201cLess content moderation on X and other platforms could have implications for what content is visible to voters.

According to legal expert Aurel Eschmann from NGO Lobby Control, the live space hosted between Musk and Weidel could count as an illegal party donation. \u201cIt's not the interview itself that would be an illegal party donation, otherwise many media formats would be a party donation, but the reach that the platform gives as you can buy boosts there for your own posts,\u201d Eschmann told Euronews. \u201cMusk is not just a user who has many followers on X, he is the owner of the platform. There is alot of evidence his posts are artificially gaining reach for all users on the platform, even those who don\u2019t follow him.\u201d Germany's far-right AfD chief pushes back on Nazi claims in chat with Elon Musk on X Data from the Bundesdatenschau, a team of data scientists that tracks the number of impressions on X posts, shows that Weidel's average post has reached 1 million impressions in the last two weeks \u2014 an enormous increase from her average impressions for the last twelve months, which were under 200,000. If Musk\u2019s live space for the AfD would be considered an illegal party donation under German law, the Bundestag would be required to investigate, according to Eschmann. Advertisements for the party could also include deliberately manipulating the algorithm to favour the AfD\u2019s posts, yet Musk himself has repeatedly denied that the algorithm is manipulated to promote content that he favours. However, a study from the Queensland University of Technology indicates that his own posts during the US election saw a sudden increase in views and engagement. As part of European officials assessing the legality of Musk\u2019s contributions on the platform, his conversation with Weidel on X has also been included in an ongoing probe launched by the European Commission into the platform on whether the discussion violates the EU\u2019s Digital Services Act. Could Musk make a financial donation to the AfD? Musk funnelled millions into US President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s campaign through his super Political Action Committee (PAC). However, German law would prevent Musk from making a substantial financial donation to the AfD, as donations to German parties from outside the EU are limited to a maximum of 1,000, a spokesperson from the Interior Ministry confirmed to Euronews. On top of this, parties in Germany must report single donations exceeding \u20ac50,000 to the president of the German Bundestag. High campaign donations such as those in the US are unusual in Germany: the AfD has not received a single official donation of over \u20ac35,000 in its history. Related EU Commission to add Musk\u2019s German AfD interview to ongoing platform probe However, if Musk was motivated to financially donate to the AfD, he could find a loophole by donating to an association or a \u201cVerein,\u201d which is allowed to collect donations over time and give them to political parties directly or through advertising, Eschmann said. \u201cThere are more opaque \u2018Verein\u2019 constructions he could use, Tesla Germany might be an option. You would have to take a closer look to see if that wouldn\u2019t be possible. It just shows the German system is not prepared or set up for this kind of influence,\u201d Eschmann explained. The AfD has also been previously accused, alongside other political parties, of raising funds through shadowy means. This included allegedly benefiting from an illegal \u20ac6 million advertising campaign between 2016 and 2018 via a shell company in Switzerland, which paid for \u201cseveral thousand posters,\u201d among other advertisements for the party. Could he influence voters? Musk has 211.4 million followers on X and the ability to reach people across the world with his opinions. Experts imagine that he could have some impact online by tapping into voters who are dissatisfied with the current German government; however, it\u2019s currently too early to tell. \u201dMusk could have some impact because there is a general kind of dissatisfaction in Germany with the lack of digitalisation, bureaucracy, the economic crisis,\u201d Philipp David Darius, a postdoctoral researcher at the Centre for Digital Governance, said. \u201cI imagine he could have some impact on legitimising the AfD\u2019s opinions to those who are more liberal leaning. Perhaps some people would see him as having this entrepreneurial charisma.\u201d More critical in shifting public opinion in Germany, Darius said, is Musk\u2019s influence on tech entrepreneurs such as Mark Zuckerberg, who recently announced he was rolling back on fact-checkers on his Meta platforms in favour of a community notes style system practised on X. A 2023 study by public broadcaster ARD showed that only 8% of Germans use X daily, with most Germans favouring Instagram (35%) and Facebook (33%), both owned by Meta. \u201cLess content moderation on X and other platforms could have implications for what content is visible to voters. Additionally, the amplification of misinformation and negative content about rival parties such as the Greens could have repercussions for their voter support, even if it doesn\u2019t gain the AfD more votes,\u201d Darius said. Recent polling doesn\u2019t indicate that Musk has won the AfD a vast influx of new votes, at least not yet. \u201cIt\u2019s very difficult to draw causal connections between people reading something online and changing their opinion,\u201d Matthias Kettemann from the Humboldt Institute for Internet and Society said. \u201cIf you look at the AfD\u2019s results in the last election, I don\u2019t think voters of the AfD would need Musk to certify the validity of their opinions, although it certainly doesn\u2019t hurt them that he approves of them.\u201d More wide-reaching in Germany itself, Kettemann explained, was the decision by Welt to publish an op-ed with Musk and the subsequent fall-out. \u201cI think that the actions of Elon Musk contribute to a polarisation of the political discourse.\u201d \u201cThe fact that Musk is trying to influence the political process is already influencing it simply through this feeling that we might not be able to trust how X regulates content around the election,\u201d he told Euronews. Musk often justifies his comments online as an act of free speech.

There is alot of evidence his posts are artificially gaining reach for all users on the platform, even those who don\u2019t follow him.\u201d Germany's far-right AfD chief pushes back on Nazi claims in chat with Elon Musk on X Data from the Bundesdatenschau, a team of data scientists that tracks the number of impressions on X posts, shows that Weidel's average post has reached 1 million impressions in the last two weeks \u2014 an enormous increase from her average impressions for the last twelve months, which were under 200,000. If Musk\u2019s live space for the AfD would be considered an illegal party donation under German law, the Bundestag would be required to investigate, according to Eschmann. Advertisements for the party could also include deliberately manipulating the algorithm to favour the AfD\u2019s posts, yet Musk himself has repeatedly denied that the algorithm is manipulated to promote content that he favours. However, a study from the Queensland University of Technology indicates that his own posts during the US election saw a sudden increase in views and engagement. As part of European officials assessing the legality of Musk\u2019s contributions on the platform, his conversation with Weidel on X has also been included in an ongoing probe launched by the European Commission into the platform on whether the discussion violates the EU\u2019s Digital Services Act. Could Musk make a financial donation to the AfD? Musk funnelled millions into US President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s campaign through his super Political Action Committee (PAC). However, German law would prevent Musk from making a substantial financial donation to the AfD, as donations to German parties from outside the EU are limited to a maximum of 1,000, a spokesperson from the Interior Ministry confirmed to Euronews. On top of this, parties in Germany must report single donations exceeding \u20ac50,000 to the president of the German Bundestag. High campaign donations such as those in the US are unusual in Germany: the AfD has not received a single official donation of over \u20ac35,000 in its history. Related EU Commission to add Musk\u2019s German AfD interview to ongoing platform probe However, if Musk was motivated to financially donate to the AfD, he could find a loophole by donating to an association or a \u201cVerein,\u201d which is allowed to collect donations over time and give them to political parties directly or through advertising, Eschmann said. \u201cThere are more opaque \u2018Verein\u2019 constructions he could use, Tesla Germany might be an option. You would have to take a closer look to see if that wouldn\u2019t be possible. It just shows the German system is not prepared or set up for this kind of influence,\u201d Eschmann explained. The AfD has also been previously accused, alongside other political parties, of raising funds through shadowy means. This included allegedly benefiting from an illegal \u20ac6 million advertising campaign between 2016 and 2018 via a shell company in Switzerland, which paid for \u201cseveral thousand posters,\u201d among other advertisements for the party. Could he influence voters? Musk has 211.4 million followers on X and the ability to reach people across the world with his opinions. Experts imagine that he could have some impact online by tapping into voters who are dissatisfied with the current German government; however, it\u2019s currently too early to tell. \u201dMusk could have some impact because there is a general kind of dissatisfaction in Germany with the lack of digitalisation, bureaucracy, the economic crisis,\u201d Philipp David Darius, a postdoctoral researcher at the Centre for Digital Governance, said. \u201cI imagine he could have some impact on legitimising the AfD\u2019s opinions to those who are more liberal leaning. Perhaps some people would see him as having this entrepreneurial charisma.\u201d More critical in shifting public opinion in Germany, Darius said, is Musk\u2019s influence on tech entrepreneurs such as Mark Zuckerberg, who recently announced he was rolling back on fact-checkers on his Meta platforms in favour of a community notes style system practised on X. A 2023 study by public broadcaster ARD showed that only 8% of Germans use X daily, with most Germans favouring Instagram (35%) and Facebook (33%), both owned by Meta. \u201cLess content moderation on X and other platforms could have implications for what content is visible to voters. Additionally, the amplification of misinformation and negative content about rival parties such as the Greens could have repercussions for their voter support, even if it doesn\u2019t gain the AfD more votes,\u201d Darius said. Recent polling doesn\u2019t indicate that Musk has won the AfD a vast influx of new votes, at least not yet. \u201cIt\u2019s very difficult to draw causal connections between people reading something online and changing their opinion,\u201d Matthias Kettemann from the Humboldt Institute for Internet and Society said. \u201cIf you look at the AfD\u2019s results in the last election, I don\u2019t think voters of the AfD would need Musk to certify the validity of their opinions, although it certainly doesn\u2019t hurt them that he approves of them.\u201d More wide-reaching in Germany itself, Kettemann explained, was the decision by Welt to publish an op-ed with Musk and the subsequent fall-out. \u201cI think that the actions of Elon Musk contribute to a polarisation of the political discourse.\u201d \u201cThe fact that Musk is trying to influence the political process is already influencing it simply through this feeling that we might not be able to trust how X regulates content around the election,\u201d he told Euronews. Musk often justifies his comments online as an act of free speech. Kettemann pointed out that there are differences in the US and European contexts regarding what is allowed under the right to freedom of speech, which is called freedom of expression in European law. \u201cThere are limits to that freedom of speech, especially the European context. If you look at the European Convention on Human Rights there is the freedom of expression but that freedom of expression can be limited through laws that relate to securing a different societal value such as the rights of others or public health or democracy,\u201d Kettemann explained. \u201cEvery individual has the right to free speech, but that also comes with responsibilities. Especially when you are a powerful actor.\u201d\n\nTOPICS: Culture/Society; Foreign Affairs; News/Current Events; Politics/Elections\nKEYWORDS: election; elonmusk; germany\n\n\n\n\n1\nposted on 01/10/2025 10:36:41 AM PST\nby nickcarraway\n\n[\nPost Reply\n | Private Reply\n | View Replies]\n\nTo: nickcarraway\n\nThe elites in Europe sure seem to be scared of Musk.

If Musk\u2019s live space for the AfD would be considered an illegal party donation under German law, the Bundestag would be required to investigate, according to Eschmann. Advertisements for the party could also include deliberately manipulating the algorithm to favour the AfD\u2019s posts, yet Musk himself has repeatedly denied that the algorithm is manipulated to promote content that he favours. However, a study from the Queensland University of Technology indicates that his own posts during the US election saw a sudden increase in views and engagement. As part of European officials assessing the legality of Musk\u2019s contributions on the platform, his conversation with Weidel on X has also been included in an ongoing probe launched by the European Commission into the platform on whether the discussion violates the EU\u2019s Digital Services Act. Could Musk make a financial donation to the AfD? Musk funnelled millions into US President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s campaign through his super Political Action Committee (PAC). However, German law would prevent Musk from making a substantial financial donation to the AfD, as donations to German parties from outside the EU are limited to a maximum of 1,000, a spokesperson from the Interior Ministry confirmed to Euronews. On top of this, parties in Germany must report single donations exceeding \u20ac50,000 to the president of the German Bundestag. High campaign donations such as those in the US are unusual in Germany: the AfD has not received a single official donation of over \u20ac35,000 in its history. Related EU Commission to add Musk\u2019s German AfD interview to ongoing platform probe However, if Musk was motivated to financially donate to the AfD, he could find a loophole by donating to an association or a \u201cVerein,\u201d which is allowed to collect donations over time and give them to political parties directly or through advertising, Eschmann said. \u201cThere are more opaque \u2018Verein\u2019 constructions he could use, Tesla Germany might be an option. You would have to take a closer look to see if that wouldn\u2019t be possible. It just shows the German system is not prepared or set up for this kind of influence,\u201d Eschmann explained. The AfD has also been previously accused, alongside other political parties, of raising funds through shadowy means. This included allegedly benefiting from an illegal \u20ac6 million advertising campaign between 2016 and 2018 via a shell company in Switzerland, which paid for \u201cseveral thousand posters,\u201d among other advertisements for the party. Could he influence voters? Musk has 211.4 million followers on X and the ability to reach people across the world with his opinions. Experts imagine that he could have some impact online by tapping into voters who are dissatisfied with the current German government; however, it\u2019s currently too early to tell. \u201dMusk could have some impact because there is a general kind of dissatisfaction in Germany with the lack of digitalisation, bureaucracy, the economic crisis,\u201d Philipp David Darius, a postdoctoral researcher at the Centre for Digital Governance, said. \u201cI imagine he could have some impact on legitimising the AfD\u2019s opinions to those who are more liberal leaning. Perhaps some people would see him as having this entrepreneurial charisma.\u201d More critical in shifting public opinion in Germany, Darius said, is Musk\u2019s influence on tech entrepreneurs such as Mark Zuckerberg, who recently announced he was rolling back on fact-checkers on his Meta platforms in favour of a community notes style system practised on X. A 2023 study by public broadcaster ARD showed that only 8% of Germans use X daily, with most Germans favouring Instagram (35%) and Facebook (33%), both owned by Meta. \u201cLess content moderation on X and other platforms could have implications for what content is visible to voters. Additionally, the amplification of misinformation and negative content about rival parties such as the Greens could have repercussions for their voter support, even if it doesn\u2019t gain the AfD more votes,\u201d Darius said. Recent polling doesn\u2019t indicate that Musk has won the AfD a vast influx of new votes, at least not yet. \u201cIt\u2019s very difficult to draw causal connections between people reading something online and changing their opinion,\u201d Matthias Kettemann from the Humboldt Institute for Internet and Society said. \u201cIf you look at the AfD\u2019s results in the last election, I don\u2019t think voters of the AfD would need Musk to certify the validity of their opinions, although it certainly doesn\u2019t hurt them that he approves of them.\u201d More wide-reaching in Germany itself, Kettemann explained, was the decision by Welt to publish an op-ed with Musk and the subsequent fall-out. \u201cI think that the actions of Elon Musk contribute to a polarisation of the political discourse.\u201d \u201cThe fact that Musk is trying to influence the political process is already influencing it simply through this feeling that we might not be able to trust how X regulates content around the election,\u201d he told Euronews. Musk often justifies his comments online as an act of free speech. Kettemann pointed out that there are differences in the US and European contexts regarding what is allowed under the right to freedom of speech, which is called freedom of expression in European law. \u201cThere are limits to that freedom of speech, especially the European context. If you look at the European Convention on Human Rights there is the freedom of expression but that freedom of expression can be limited through laws that relate to securing a different societal value such as the rights of others or public health or democracy,\u201d Kettemann explained. \u201cEvery individual has the right to free speech, but that also comes with responsibilities. Especially when you are a powerful actor.\u201d\n\nTOPICS: Culture/Society; Foreign Affairs; News/Current Events; Politics/Elections\nKEYWORDS: election; elonmusk; germany\n\n\n\n\n1\nposted on 01/10/2025 10:36:41 AM PST\nby nickcarraway\n\n[\nPost Reply\n | Private Reply\n | View Replies]\n\nTo: nickcarraway\n\nThe elites in Europe sure seem to be scared of Musk.

As part of European officials assessing the legality of Musk\u2019s contributions on the platform, his conversation with Weidel on X has also been included in an ongoing probe launched by the European Commission into the platform on whether the discussion violates the EU\u2019s Digital Services Act. Could Musk make a financial donation to the AfD? Musk funnelled millions into US President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s campaign through his super Political Action Committee (PAC).

On top of this, parties in Germany must report single donations exceeding \u20ac50,000 to the president of the German Bundestag.

Musk funnelled millions into US President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s campaign through his super Political Action Committee (PAC). However, German law would prevent Musk from making a substantial financial donation to the AfD, as donations to German parties from outside the EU are limited to a maximum of 1,000, a spokesperson from the Interior Ministry confirmed to Euronews. On top of this, parties in Germany must report single donations exceeding \u20ac50,000 to the president of the German Bundestag. High campaign donations such as those in the US are unusual in Germany: the AfD has not received a single official donation of over \u20ac35,000 in its history. Related EU Commission to add Musk\u2019s German AfD interview to ongoing platform probe However, if Musk was motivated to financially donate to the AfD, he could find a loophole by donating to an association or a \u201cVerein,\u201d which is allowed to collect donations over time and give them to political parties directly or through advertising, Eschmann said. \u201cThere are more opaque \u2018Verein\u2019 constructions he could use, Tesla Germany might be an option. You would have to take a closer look to see if that wouldn\u2019t be possible. It just shows the German system is not prepared or set up for this kind of influence,\u201d Eschmann explained. The AfD has also been previously accused, alongside other political parties, of raising funds through shadowy means. This included allegedly benefiting from an illegal \u20ac6 million advertising campaign between 2016 and 2018 via a shell company in Switzerland, which paid for \u201cseveral thousand posters,\u201d among other advertisements for the party. Could he influence voters? Musk has 211.4 million followers on X and the ability to reach people across the world with his opinions. Experts imagine that he could have some impact online by tapping into voters who are dissatisfied with the current German government; however, it\u2019s currently too early to tell. \u201dMusk could have some impact because there is a general kind of dissatisfaction in Germany with the lack of digitalisation, bureaucracy, the economic crisis,\u201d Philipp David Darius, a postdoctoral researcher at the Centre for Digital Governance, said. \u201cI imagine he could have some impact on legitimising the AfD\u2019s opinions to those who are more liberal leaning. Perhaps some people would see him as having this entrepreneurial charisma.\u201d More critical in shifting public opinion in Germany, Darius said, is Musk\u2019s influence on tech entrepreneurs such as Mark Zuckerberg, who recently announced he was rolling back on fact-checkers on his Meta platforms in favour of a community notes style system practised on X. A 2023 study by public broadcaster ARD showed that only 8% of Germans use X daily, with most Germans favouring Instagram (35%) and Facebook (33%), both owned by Meta. \u201cLess content moderation on X and other platforms could have implications for what content is visible to voters. Additionally, the amplification of misinformation and negative content about rival parties such as the Greens could have repercussions for their voter support, even if it doesn\u2019t gain the AfD more votes,\u201d Darius said. Recent polling doesn\u2019t indicate that Musk has won the AfD a vast influx of new votes, at least not yet. \u201cIt\u2019s very difficult to draw causal connections between people reading something online and changing their opinion,\u201d Matthias Kettemann from the Humboldt Institute for Internet and Society said. \u201cIf you look at the AfD\u2019s results in the last election, I don\u2019t think voters of the AfD would need Musk to certify the validity of their opinions, although it certainly doesn\u2019t hurt them that he approves of them.\u201d More wide-reaching in Germany itself, Kettemann explained, was the decision by Welt to publish an op-ed with Musk and the subsequent fall-out. \u201cI think that the actions of Elon Musk contribute to a polarisation of the political discourse.\u201d \u201cThe fact that Musk is trying to influence the political process is already influencing it simply through this feeling that we might not be able to trust how X regulates content around the election,\u201d he told Euronews. Musk often justifies his comments online as an act of free speech. Kettemann pointed out that there are differences in the US and European contexts regarding what is allowed under the right to freedom of speech, which is called freedom of expression in European law. \u201cThere are limits to that freedom of speech, especially the European context. If you look at the European Convention on Human Rights there is the freedom of expression but that freedom of expression can be limited through laws that relate to securing a different societal value such as the rights of others or public health or democracy,\u201d Kettemann explained. \u201cEvery individual has the right to free speech, but that also comes with responsibilities.

The AfD has also been previously accused, alongside other political parties, of raising funds through shadowy means.

Could he influence voters? Musk has 211.4 million followers on X and the ability to reach people across the world with his opinions. Experts imagine that he could have some impact online by tapping into voters who are dissatisfied with the current German government; however, it\u2019s currently too early to tell. \u201dMusk could have some impact because there is a general kind of dissatisfaction in Germany with the lack of digitalisation, bureaucracy, the economic crisis,\u201d Philipp David Darius, a postdoctoral researcher at the Centre for Digital Governance, said. \u201cI imagine he could have some impact on legitimising the AfD\u2019s opinions to those who are more liberal leaning. Perhaps some people would see him as having this entrepreneurial charisma.\u201d More critical in shifting public opinion in Germany, Darius said, is Musk\u2019s influence on tech entrepreneurs such as Mark Zuckerberg, who recently announced he was rolling back on fact-checkers on his Meta platforms in favour of a community notes style system practised on X. A 2023 study by public broadcaster ARD showed that only 8% of Germans use X daily, with most Germans favouring Instagram (35%) and Facebook (33%), both owned by Meta. \u201cLess content moderation on X and other platforms could have implications for what content is visible to voters. Additionally, the amplification of misinformation and negative content about rival parties such as the Greens could have repercussions for their voter support, even if it doesn\u2019t gain the AfD more votes,\u201d Darius said. Recent polling doesn\u2019t indicate that Musk has won the AfD a vast influx of new votes, at least not yet. \u201cIt\u2019s very difficult to draw causal connections between people reading something online and changing their opinion,\u201d Matthias Kettemann from the Humboldt Institute for Internet and Society said. \u201cIf you look at the AfD\u2019s results in the last election, I don\u2019t think voters of the AfD would need Musk to certify the validity of their opinions, although it certainly doesn\u2019t hurt them that he approves of them.\u201d More wide-reaching in Germany itself, Kettemann explained, was the decision by Welt to publish an op-ed with Musk and the subsequent fall-out. \u201cI think that the actions of Elon Musk contribute to a polarisation of the political discourse.\u201d \u201cThe fact that Musk is trying to influence the political process is already influencing it simply through this feeling that we might not be able to trust how X regulates content around the election,\u201d he told Euronews. Musk often justifies his comments online as an act of free speech. Kettemann pointed out that there are differences in the US and European contexts regarding what is allowed under the right to freedom of speech, which is called freedom of expression in European law. \u201cThere are limits to that freedom of speech, especially the European context. If you look at the European Convention on Human Rights there is the freedom of expression but that freedom of expression can be limited through laws that relate to securing a different societal value such as the rights of others or public health or democracy,\u201d Kettemann explained. \u201cEvery individual has the right to free speech, but that also comes with responsibilities.

Musk often justifies his comments online as an act of free speech. Kettemann pointed out that there are differences in the US and European contexts regarding what is allowed under the right to freedom of speech, which is called freedom of expression in European law. \u201cThere are limits to that freedom of speech, especially the European context. If you look at the European Convention on Human Rights there is the freedom of expression but that freedom of expression can be limited through laws that relate to securing a different societal value such as the rights of others or public health or democracy,\u201d Kettemann explained. \u201cEvery individual has the right to free speech, but that also comes with responsibilities.

Kettemann pointed out that there are differences in the US and European contexts regarding what is allowed under the right to freedom of speech, which is called freedom of expression in European law. \u201cThere are limits to that freedom of speech, especially the European context. If you look at the European Convention on Human Rights there is the freedom of expression but that freedom of expression can be limited through laws that relate to securing a different societal value such as the rights of others or public health or democracy,\u201d Kettemann explained. \u201cEvery individual has the right to free speech, but that also comes with responsibilities.

Elon Musk is being investigated in Europe amid concerns the billionaire's influence, for instance through his posts on X, constitutes an \"interference\" in upcoming elections.Newsweek has contacted Musk via the press office of X, the social media platform he owns, formerly known as Twitter, for comment via email.Why It MattersMusk played a significant role during Donald Trump's 2024 presidential campaign and is set to co-lead the Department of Government Efficiency in the upcoming administration.The billionaire appears to now be focusing on European politics, having endorsed far-right and anti-establishment parties.\n\nTesla and SpaceX CEO Elon Musk looks during the reopening ceremony inside Notre-Dame Cathedral in Paris on December 7, 2024. Musk is being investigated over claims he is interfering in European elections. \nTesla and SpaceX CEO Elon Musk looks during the reopening ceremony inside Notre-Dame Cathedral in Paris on December 7, 2024. Musk is being investigated over claims he is interfering in European elections. \nCHRISTOPHE PETIT TESSON/POOL/AFP/Getty Images\n  What to KnowMusk has expressed support on X for the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) party and its leader, Alice Weidel. He also published an opinion piece in the German newspaper Welt am Sonntag endorsing the party. Eva Marie Kogel, the paper's opinion editor, resigned in protest.On Thursday, Musk participated in a livestream on X with Weidel, where he encouraged voters to support the anti-immigration AfD in Germany's February elections.The administration of Germany's lower house of parliament, the Bundestag, is investigating whether Musk's support for the AfD on the platform where he has 210 million followers could constitute an illegal party donation.Under German law, campaigning by third parties is considered a party donation. LobbyControl, a non-governmental advocacy group promoting transparency and democracy, suggested on Wednesday that Musk's online discussion with Weidel might amount to such a donation.Damian Boeselager, a German member of the European Parliament, has called on the European Commission to look into Musk's alleged \"interference\" in Germany's and other European elections. Boeselager outlined his concerns in a January 4 letter to Henna Maria Virkkunen, executive vice president of the European Commission for Technological Sovereignty, Security and Democracy.Musk has also targeted Britain's Labour government and Prime Minister Keir Starmer. He accused Starmer of failing to prosecute child grooming gangs in northern England during his tenure as director of public prosecutions from 2008 to 2013. Starmer responded by warning against \"those who are spreading lies and misinformation.\"On Thursday, The Financial Times, citing unnamed sources, reported that Musk is exploring ways to remove Starmer before the U.K.'s next election and replace the current center-left government with a right-wing party.Musk has shown support for the right-wing party Reform UK but has suggested that its leader, key Brexit campaigner Nigel Farage, be replaced.On Monday, French President Emmanuel Macron criticized Musk's attempts to \"intervene directly in elections,\" including those in Germany.During a Wednesday interview with France Inter radio, French Foreign Minister Jean-No\u00ebl Barrot urged the European Commission to protect member states from election interference \"with the greatest firmness\" when asked about Musk.What People Are SayingA Bundestag spokesman told Die Welt regarding the investigation into Musk: \"In this case, the facts are currently being clarified.\"Elon Musk, posting on X on January 8: \"First, the EU tried to stop me from having an online conversation with President Donald Trump.

He also published an opinion piece in the German newspaper Welt am Sonntag endorsing the party. Eva Marie Kogel, the paper's opinion editor, resigned in protest.On Thursday, Musk participated in a livestream on X with Weidel, where he encouraged voters to support the anti-immigration AfD in Germany's February elections.The administration of Germany's lower house of parliament, the Bundestag, is investigating whether Musk's support for the AfD on the platform where he has 210 million followers could constitute an illegal party donation.Under German law, campaigning by third parties is considered a party donation. LobbyControl, a non-governmental advocacy group promoting transparency and democracy, suggested on Wednesday that Musk's online discussion with Weidel might amount to such a donation.Damian Boeselager, a German member of the European Parliament, has called on the European Commission to look into Musk's alleged \"interference\" in Germany's and other European elections. Boeselager outlined his concerns in a January 4 letter to Henna Maria Virkkunen, executive vice president of the European Commission for Technological Sovereignty, Security and Democracy.Musk has also targeted Britain's Labour government and Prime Minister Keir Starmer. He accused Starmer of failing to prosecute child grooming gangs in northern England during his tenure as director of public prosecutions from 2008 to 2013. Starmer responded by warning against \"those who are spreading lies and misinformation.\"On Thursday, The Financial Times, citing unnamed sources, reported that Musk is exploring ways to remove Starmer before the U.K.'s next election and replace the current center-left government with a right-wing party.Musk has shown support for the right-wing party Reform UK but has suggested that its leader, key Brexit campaigner Nigel Farage, be replaced.On Monday, French President Emmanuel Macron criticized Musk's attempts to \"intervene directly in elections,\" including those in Germany.During a Wednesday interview with France Inter radio, French Foreign Minister Jean-No\u00ebl Barrot urged the European Commission to protect member states from election interference \"with the greatest firmness\" when asked about Musk.What People Are SayingA Bundestag spokesman told Die Welt regarding the investigation into Musk: \"In this case, the facts are currently being clarified.\"Elon Musk, posting on X on January 8: \"First, the EU tried to stop me from having an online conversation with President Donald Trump.

EU lawmakers will launch the search for answers on Tuesday, as the 27-nation bloc walks a fine line between guarding its interests and avoiding the ire of the mercurial US leader.Their debate at the European Parliament in Strasbourg, a day after Trump was sworn in under the dome of the US Capitol, is set to highlight the difficult dilemmas facing the old continent.ALSO READ: Inside the parade of right-wing world leaders flocking to D.C. for Trump's inaugurationSince the Republican's electoral win in November, European Union leaders have sought to project confidence, insisting the bloc had learned how to deal with Trump and was prepared for his comeback.Campaign trail promises to \"take other countries' jobs\", slap tariffs on US allies and halt aid to Ukraine barely elicited a reaction as Brussels insisted it was ready, come what may. But as Trump's menaces and outbursts, including a threat to annex Greenland, piled on after the vote, some lawmakers have grown impatient with the EU's wait-and-see attitude. \"We share a lot of things with the Americans, but at the same time we must not be naive,\" warned Marie-Pierre Vedrenne, from the centrist Renew group.\"We must not let our actions be dictated to us by Donald Trump or Elon Musk.\" Lawmakers will debate whether the EU can find a unified voice to confront a cantankerous Washington. But parliament itself is divided on the issue and -- unlike many national assemblies -- holds little real power, particularly on foreign policy.- 'Smelling fear' - A majority of parliamentarians are likely to denounce the \"interference\" of the world's richest man in European politics -- after Musk publicly backed a far-right party in Germany's upcoming elections.They will also up the pressure on the European Commission -- the EU's executive body -- to crack down on social media, including Musk's X, if found in breach of EU digital rules.\"When beasts smell fear they attack (with) double\" the ferocity, said socialist lawmaker Laura Ballarin Cereza, voicing concern about the bloc's muted response to incursions by Musk and Trump into its affairs.But the power duo have plenty of supporters too in Strasbourg, where they elicit fascination and adulation from some on the right.A dozen lawmakers travelled to a freezing cold Washington to participate in the festivities linked to Trump's inauguration, as did Italy's hard-right Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni.Far-right lawmakers, whose influence has grown following June European elections, have rejected calls for the commission to firmly apply the Digital Services Act -- the EU's landmark rules tackling illegal and harmful activities online -- which could place Musk at risk of copious fines.\"We are used to seeing this type of censorship under China or Cuba,\" said Alonso de Mendoza Asensi, a spokesman for the Patriots for Europe group. \"It's really troubling to witness this happening now in Europe\".

Outside of his bizarre devotion to Bush and his idiotic willingness to get involved in Iraq, he will go down as one of the better modern PMs. There was very little about him that was \"left wing\", other than in relative terms to the conservatives. Stop embarrassing yourself by trying to sound intelligent on a topic you clearly know nothing about.\nOh, please. Blair and co were dragging Labour back from far-left to centre-left combined with fusion of corporate and bureaucratic state that helped to fuel the growth of a few super-rich while entrenching a leftist bureaucracy that's now extremely difficult to dislodge.\nAs for the tories, it wasn't their politics\u00a0per se\u00a0that led to their downfall, it was their incompetence. And their complete inability to read the room. They had parties during the very lockdown periods in which they ordered people to stay at home, and while regular people weren't allowed to visit their relatives in hospital, the Hooray Henries in the conservative government were having the time of their lives and boasting about getting away with it.\nThe Tories' downfall was a combination of politics, incompetence and pure hubris. Their lockdown parties were evidence they knew the virus's harm was being grossly exaggerated yet they pursued authoritarian lockdowns, masking and the like with gusto while ignoring truly safe and effective measures that were emerging. And their immigration and economic mismanagement were shocking. Liz Truss was trying to put things right but was white-anted by crooks in her own party and an unelected establishment that was hell-bent on resisting change.  She's been quite candid in long-form interviews over the last couple of years about this, but was blocked and sabotaged from doing anything to combat the problems during her disappointingly brief tenure as PM.\nUnder Labour, the UK is getting even worse now than when Labour-lite was running it.\nI assume you're one of those people who thinks 14 years of mismanagement can be fixed overnight. This kind of short term, selfish thinking is typical of modern politics, and also a reason why nothing ever gets done.\nNice try, but no doughnut. Of course it'll take years to even start undoing the damage. But Starmer is doing his bit to make it even worse. On top of economic incompetence, is lot have been doubling down on trying to cover up the pure evil of the grooming gangs, which under Labour and the Conservatives alike were running rampant because governments and the public service put political correctness above fighting crime. Purely selfish, backside-covering if ever you've seen it.\nGermany has been little different, pursuing net-zero madness and poorly controlled immigration under both nominally right-wing government under Merkel and unapologetic left-wing government under Scholz et al. Germans are finally losing patience and fighting back through the ballot box. too bad if you don't like it, but it's policies you tend to support that caused the problems in the first place. Deal with it.\n\"...urged the EU to use its laws more robustly to guard against outside interference.\"\nAmusing since the EU heavyweights are still fresh from interfering in Georgian and Romanian elections. The usual hypocrisy.\nlincolnmanToday\u00a0\u00a008:50 am JST......\"King Elon the Autistic\nNo need to be nasty and disparage autism.\nthinks he can interfere in the internal affairs of any country...\nAh, the good ole time worn US tradition.\nThe AfD is of course far away from being far-right, being only a step by step grown conservative replacement for the former conservative CDU party which very heavily shifted to center-left and green under former Merkel government and a big coalition with the social democrats SPD.

The Tesla founder\u2019s personal three-point plan would \u201celiminate\u201d those out to destroy Isreal, the re-education of Palestinian children not to hate Israel from a young age and bring prosperity to Palestinian territories.\nThursday\u2019s event was the latest intervention in the German election that has sparked controversy \u2013 and some amusement \u2013 in Germany.\nChancellor Olaf Scholz, asked about Mr Musk\u2019s claim that only the AfD could \u201csave\u201d Germany, replied: \u201cI don\u2019t believe in courting Mr Musk\u2019s favour. I\u2019m happy to leave that to others. The rule is: don\u2019t feed the troll.\u201d\nThe AfD began life over a decade ago as an anti-EU bailout party and now embraces neoliberal economics, xenophobic anti-migration and pro-Russian security policies. Last September it topped the poll in one eastern regional election and finished second in two other polls. In second place in opinion polls with 20-21 per cent, the party hopes the Musk will lift its support to another level.\nDespite record support, party politicians court controversy regularly over comments relativising the Holocaust and pushing the \u201cremigration\u201d \u2013 forced deportation \u2013 of millions of immigrants and non-ethnic German citizens.\nIn a televised debate last October, pressed on the term \u201cremigration\u201d, Ms Weidel called it a \u201claw enforcement\u201d proposal to forcibly remove anyone without a residence permit or who commits crimes.\nThe AfD surge in support has forced other parties to shift, in particular the centre-right Christian Democratic Union (CDU).\n[\u00a0Elon Musk fights Battle of Britain on two fronts as he clashes with Nigel Farage and Keir StarmerOpens in new window\u00a0]\n[\u00a0Calls for EU to resist social media giants regulation rollbackOpens in new window\u00a0]\nLast week CDU leader Friedrich Merz attracted controversy for suggesting that dual citizens who commit a crime here should lose their German passport.\nMr Musk\u2019s interest in German politics has sparked heated debate, too, around the Springer media group and its Welt conservative newspaper.\nIn an opinion piece late last month, published in the newspaper\u2019s Sunday edition, Musk said the AfD was the last hope to prevent Germany \u201cbecoming a shadow of itself\u201d.\n\u201cThe traditional parties have failed, their policies have led to economic stagnation, social unrest and a hollowing out of national identity,\u201d he added. \u201cThe AfD ... represents a political realism that is well received by many Germans who feel that their concerns are ignored by the establishment.\u201d\nLabelling it right-wing extremist was false, Mr Musk added, citing as proof Ms Weidel\u2019s same-sex relationship with a Sri Lankan woman.\n\u201cDoes that sounds like Hitler? I ask you.\u201d\nAmid a barrage of criticism, Welt publisher Jan Philipp Burghard, who wrote a contra piece, defended his decision to publish Mr Musk\u2019s pro-AfD piece.\n\u201cWe have started a worldwide debate about the consequences of an in-part right-wing extremist party taking power in Germany,\u201d he told the Frankfurter Allgemeine (FAZ) daily, accusing critics of double-standards for calling the Musk piece an unwarranted election intervention.\nHe cited other such articles \u2013 US-Hungarian billionaire George Soros for the Greens in 2019 or a 2022 Le Monde article by Olaf Scholz backing Emmanuel Macron for a second term as president.\nOther leading German politicians, he pointed out, had intervened regularly in US political campaigning to denounce Donald Trump as \u201cdangerous and shameful\u201d, while Die Zeit weekly published an opinion piece by Vladimir Putin 2021, after Russia\u2019s illegal annexation of Crimea.\nSome of Musk\u2019s interventions have sparked more mirth than controversy, such as his attack on Germany\u2019s largely ceremonial federal president Frank Walter Steinmeier as an \u201cundemocratic tyrant\u201d.\nMusk\u2019s interventions have been cheered in some corners of the German media. The right-wing nationalist portal Achgut defended Musk\u2019s right to praise AfD and its plans to tackle German red tape, given he spent \u20ac5.6 billion on his Tesla factory outside Berlin.\n\u201cHe probably knows more about Germany\u2019s metastatic bureaucratic monster Germany than the entire government,\u201d it commented, \u201cbecause he has experienced it first-hand.\u201d\nFor her part, Alice Weidel has dismissed German criticism of Musk\u2019s interventions as part of a campaign pushed by \u201cquestionable\u201d non-governmental organisations.\n\u201cIt threatens the left\u2019s dominance of discourse,\u201d she wrote on Twitter/X. \u201cElon Musk gives freedom a path.\u201d\nDerek Scally is an Irish Times journalist based in Berlin\n\u00a9 2025 The Irish Times DAC",

The government was thrown into turmoil when Scholz fired Finance Minister Christian Lindner in November following months of disagreements over Germany\u2019s budget.\nAnalysts say Scholz fully expected to lose the vote but wanted to trigger earlier elections, which he sees as his party\u2019s last chance to cling to any power. Before Monday\u2019s vote, Scholz said an election would be an opportunity to set the country on a new course.\nFollowing the vote of no confidence, the German parliament was dissolved by President Frank-Walter Steinmeier of SPD on Friday, and snap elections were called for February 23, 2025, seven months before parliamentary elections were originally scheduled to take place.\nThe Alternative for Germany (AfD) is considered to be a far-right populist party in Germany. It was founded in 2013 and was holding 76 seats out of the 733 seats in the German parliament, or Bundestag before dissolution.\nAfD is a Eurosceptic party, which means it is critical of Germany\u2019s integration into the European Union.\nAfD is also openly critical of Islam and opposes mass immigration. The party opposed former German Chancellor Angela Merkel\u2019s welcoming stance towards immigrants arriving from the Middle East and Africa. In 2015, under Merkel\u2019s leadership, more than 1 million refugees arrived in Germany.\nIn September this year, AfD won a key election for the eight Landtag seats of the eastern state of Thuringia with 32.8 percent of the vote, marking the first state election win for a far-right party since World War II.\nThe AfD nominated party leader Alice Weidel as its candidate for chancellor in early December. The nomination is largely symbolic since the party is unlikely to win a majority. Once the Bundestag is elected, it votes for the chancellor. To become chancellor, a candidate needs to receive votes from more than half of the parliament.\nFor the upcoming election, the latest polls place AfD in second place with support from 19 percent of the electorate as of December 28, according to Politico. In the first place, with 30 percent, is the conservative coalition comprising centre-right parties Christian Democratic Union of Germany (CDU) and the Christian Social Union in Bavaria (CSU).\nThe previous governing group, SPD, is in third place, with 17 percent support projected.\nThe mainstream parties have refused to work with AfD in government, but it is nevertheless projected to form the largest opposition in parliament following the upcoming elections.\nOn December 20, Musk posted on X, the social media platform he owns: \u201cOnly the AfD can save Germany.\u201d\nMusk, who has become a close aide to US President-elect Donald Trump, expanded on his support for the AfD in an opinion piece for Welt am Sonntag, a German Sunday newspaper. The paper is published by the Axel Springer media group, which also owns US-based political site, Politico.\nMusk\u2019s article was published online on Sunday. Translated, it reads: \u201cThe portrayal of the AfD as right-wing extremist is clearly false, considering that Alice Weidel, the party\u2019s leader, has a same-sex partner from Sri Lanka! Does that sound like Hitler to you? Please!\u201d\nHe wrote that Germany is on \u201cthe brink of economic and cultural collapse\u201d and \u201cAfD can save Germany from becoming a shadow of its former self\u201d.\nMusk wrote that he had \u201csignificant investments\u201d in Germany, which gave him the right to comment about the country.\nSaying that Germany\u2019s traditional parties have failed in Germany, Musk wrote, \u201cThe AfD, even though it is described as far-right, represents a political realism that resonates with many Germans who feel their concerns are ignored by the establishment.\u201d\nMusk has openly backed other far-right figures recently, including Nigel Farage of the United Kingdom\u2019s Reform party and Italy\u2019s right-wing Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni. On Thursday, Musk posted on X campaigning for the release of far-right UK activist Tommy Robinson.\nRobinson was jailed for 18 months in October 2024 after he made false accusations against a Syrian refugee schoolboy.\nMusk, who was born in South Africa but is also a naturalised US citizen, has also been known for getting involved in US politics and was a prominent part of Trump\u2019s presidential campaign. Last month, Trump refuted claims that he had \u201cceded the presidency\u201d to Musk.\n\n\n\n\u201cIt is indeed the case that Elon Musk is trying to influence the federal election,\u201d German government spokesperson Christiane Hoffmann said at a regular media briefing on Monday.\n\u201cAfter all, freedom of opinion also covers the greatest nonsense.\u201d\nFriedrich Merz, leader of the opposition Christian Democrats and the current favourite to be elected chancellor in the upcoming elections, described Musk\u2019s words as \u201cintrusive and pretentious\u201d in an interview with German newspaper Funke Media Group.\n\u201cI cannot recall a comparable case of interference, in the history of Western democracies, in the election campaign of a friendly country,\u201d Merz said.\n\u201cIn Elon Musk\u2019s world, democracy and workers\u2019 rights are obstacles to more profit,\u201d Saskia Esken, co-leader of SPD told Reuters. \u201cWe say quite clearly: Our democracy is defensible and it cannot be bought.\u201d\nShortly after Musk\u2019s piece was published, Eva Marie Kogel, the opinions editor at Welt am Sonntag, announced her resignation on X.\n\u201cI always enjoyed heading the opinion section,\u201d Kogel wrote in an X post on December 28. \u201cToday an article by Elon Musk appeared in Welt am Sonntag. I handed in my resignation yesterday after it went to print.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFollow Al Jazeera English:",

Earlier this week, Farage boasted that Musk is \u201cright behind\u201d him \u2014 and raised the prospect that the tech tycoon would financially back his Reform UK party.\nThe AfD endorsement also served as a stark rebuke by U.S. President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s most powerful adviser of the conservative alliance that is likely to lead Germany following a snap election set for Feb. 23.\nFriedrich Merz, the conservative candidate leading the race to become next chancellor, has portrayed himself as leader who\u2019d be able to make \u201cdeals\u201d with Trump despite European fears the president elect will start a trade war and withdraw American military support for Ukraine.\nAfD leaders, of course, were pleased by Musk\u2019s endorsement.\n\u201cYes! You are perfectly right!\u201d Alice Weidel, the AfD\u2019s chancellor candidate, posted on X shortly after Musk\u2019s missive. Weidel then plugged a recent interview she gave on, as she put it, how \u201csocialist [Angela] Merkel ruined our country\u201d and how \u201cthe Soviet European Union\u201d was destroying Germany.\nAmong mainstream political leaders in Germany, however, the post prompted a backlash.\n\u201cWe have freedom of speech, which also applies to multi-billionaires,\u201d Chancellor Olaf Scholz said at a press conference in Berlin. \u201cBut freedom of speech also means you can say things that are not right and do not contain good political advice.\u201d\nThe AfD is\u00a0polling\u00a0in second place at 19 percent ahead of Germany\u2019s early election, potentially setting it up to become the largest opposition party in the next parliament. Germany\u2019s conservative alliance leads the race by a wide margin with 31 percent.\nMusk, who is closely allied to U.S. President-elect Donald Trump, has longed expressed sympathy for the AfD \u2014\u00a0but, also, some uncertainty about the party\u2019s stances.\n\u201cWhy is there such a negative reaction from some about AfD?\u201d the tech billionaire wrote on X in June. \u201cThey keep saying \u2018far right,\u2019 but the policies of AfD that I\u2019ve read about don\u2019t sound extremist. Maybe I\u2019m missing something.\u201d\nDespite the newfound love between Musk and the AfD, the far-right party has opposed Tesla\u2019s Gigafactory in the German state of Brandenburg, surrounding Berlin.\n\u201cWe will not tear it down, but of course it is a problem,\u201d the party\u2019s front-runner in the state\u00a0said\u00a0during a debate in the run-up to the Brandenburg state election in September, in which the AfD finished second with over 29 percent of the vote.\nThe AfD is surging despite its growing radicalism and persistent warnings from mainstream leaders that it is an extremist,\u00a0even Nazi, party. Growing support for the far right comes despite state-level domestic intelligence authorities classifying some local branches of the party as extremist organizations aiming to undermine German democracy.\nMusk lent his support to the AfD while reposting a video by Naomi Seibt, a German right-wing influencer known for her closeness to the AfD and for denying climate change caused by humans. German media have dubbed her the \u201canti-Greta,\u201d in reference to Swedish climate activist Greta Thunberg, and in the video reposted by Musk, she described the German Greens\u2019 environmental policies as \u201ceco-socialist national suicide.\u201d\nSeibt\u2019s video mainly consisted of an attack on the conservative leader Merz, who is leading the race to become the next chancellor, for his refusal to work with the AfD and his supposed criticism of what she called the \u201cpro freedom\u201d policies of Elon Musk and Argentina\u2019s President Javier Milei.\nChristian Lindner, the former finance minister and leader of the fiscally conservative Free Democratic Party (FDP), praised Musk\u2019s ideas on cutting regulation and bureaucracy while warning against the AfD.\n\u201cElon, I\u2019ve initiated a policy debate inspired by ideas from you and Milei,\u201d Lindner posted on X. \u201cWhile migration control is crucial for Germany, the AfD stands against freedom, business \u2013 and it\u2019s a far-right extremist party. Don\u2019t rush to conclusions from afar.\u201d\nMusk, a U.S. citizen \u2014 who spent more than a quarter-billion dollars to help elect Trump \u2014\u00a0is considering\u00a0donating up to $100 million\u00a0to support Farage\u2019s right-wing party in the U.K., according to media reports.\nHe wouldn\u2019t be able to support the AfD in the same way. Non-EU foreigners are only allowed to donate up to a maximum of \u20ac1,000, according to German\u00a0law.\nThis story has been updated.\nChancellor Olaf Scholz\u2019s latest demand is likely to stall a \u20ac3 billion aid package to the war-ravaged country as Russian forces continue their advance.\n\u201cThe objective exchange of arguments is becoming increasingly difficult\u201d on the platform formerly known as Twitter, says defense ministry.\nThe EU\u2019s strategy to deal with the far-right Freedom Party heading for power in Vienna is \u2026 hope for the best.\nConservative chancellor candidate Friedrich Merz railed against the climate policies of the left-leaning parties he\u2019ll likely have to govern with.",

            "content": "Hi, what are you looking for?\nBy\nPublished\nAs someone born in West Germany who is openly gay and has a non-German partner, Alice Weidel is in some ways a surprising choice as the far-right AfD\u2019s candidate for chancellor ahead of February elections.\nBut the 45-year-old who says Margaret Thatcher is her political idol has helped create new momentum for the AfD by digging into some of its more radical positions and cosying up to US tech billionaire Elon Musk.\nWeidel, who lives in Switzerland and has two sons with her Sri Lankan partner, was officially crowned as the AfD\u2019s chancellor candidate at an upbeat party conference this weekend.\nThe AfD has long been polling in second place behind the conservatives but one survey on Saturday showed it had increased its vote share to 22 percent \u2014 a score that would be its highest ever result at the national level.\nThe AfD has little chance of being part of Germany\u2019s next government since working with the far right remains a major taboo in German politics because of its Nazi history.\nBut Weidel has managed to make a big mark on the election campaign since she was first nominated as the party\u2019s pick for chancellor in December.\nLast week Weidel was hosted by Musk, the world\u2019s richest man and a key Donald Trump ally, for a wide-ranging livestream on his X social media platform.\nMusk also boosted the livestream of the AfD\u2019s congress this weekend by sharing it on his own X account, helping it gain a worldwide audience.\n\u2013 \u2018Perfect fig leaf\u2019 \u2013\nGermany\u2019s Der Spiegel magazine said Weidel was \u201cthe perfect fig leaf\u201d for a party often accused of not being inclusive.\n\u201cIf someone accuses the AfD of being misogynistic, homophobic or racist, they can say they have Weidel\u2026 so the AfD cannot be all of those things, even though it is,\u201d the magazine said.\nOften seen wearing a pearl necklace and a trouser suit, Weidel was born and educated in western Germany \u2014 while the AfD\u2019s core voter base is in the country\u2019s former communist east.\nShe later lived in China for a year, working at Bank of China, before moving on to Goldman Sachs.\nWeidel first joined the AfD in 2013, the year it was founded, and unlike many other early members who quit as it became more overtly xenophobic, she stayed.\nWeidel represents a more moderate wing of the AfD that \u201caspires to an independent existence to the right of the conservatives, with the possibility of forming a coalition\u201d, according to Wolfgang Schroeder, a professor of politics at Kassel University.\nAs a West German and a gay woman, Weidel has had \u201csome problems connecting with the ideology of her party\u201d, according to political scientist Anna-Sophie Heinze from Trier University.\nBut she has gained broader support by \u201cslowly giving up her initial criticism\u201d of figures like Bjoern Hoecke, a lodestar for the radical right in the party, Heinze said.\nShe has also stood out for her ability to avoid being caught up in many of the controversies surrounding her party in recent years.\n\u2013 \u2018More radical than ever\u2019 \u2013\nHowever, Weidel has not shied away from some of the party\u2019s more radical positions in the run-up to the election.\nIn her chat with Musk, Weidel described Hitler as a \u201ccommunist\u201d and a \u201csocialist\u201d, leading to accusations of historical revisionism.\nAnd in her speech at the party congress on Saturday, Weidel was sounding \u201cmore radical than ever\u201d, according to an analysis by the NTV news channel.\nThe first 100 days of a government containing the AfD would see the \u201ctotal closing of Germany\u2019s borders and the turning back anyone travelling without documents\u201d as well as \u201clarge-scale repatriations\u201d, she said.\n\u201cI say to you quite honestly, if this must be called remigration, then let it be called remigration.\u201d\nWhile Marine Le Pen in France and Giorgia Meloni in Italy have made inroads into the mainstream, Weidel remains \u201cthe opposition within the opposition\u201d in Germany, according to Schroeder.\nWhile other far-right parties have sought to tack towards the middle or at least soften their image, the AfD \u201cdoes not want to adapt\u201d, Schroeder said.\n\u201cWeidel is still anchored in the anti-system attitude,\u201d he said.\nWith 2,400 staff representing 100 different nationalities, AFP covers the world as a leading global news agency.

The AfD wants to adopt its election program in Riesa.\nAlice Weidel is raising two sons with her partner, a Swiss woman born in Sri Lanka.\nThe lesbian leader of Germany\u2019s far-right Alternative for Germany party, or AfD, lives a life that her political party rejects, yet she was just elected as the party\u2019s first-ever candidate for chancellor. Alice Weidel\u2019s rise to prominence within a party known for its anti-LGBTQ+ and nationalist rhetoric highlights a glaring contradiction as Germans prepare to head into a federal election on February 23.\nAt the AfD\u2019s weekend conference in Riesa, Saxony, delegates unanimously elected Weidel to lead their charge for power. Simultaneously, they adopted policies excluding families like hers from their definition of \u201cacceptable.\u201d The delegates included the sentence \u201cThe family, consisting of father, mother, and children, is the nucleus of society\u201d in their election program. Initially, The draft program only stated: \u201cThe family is the nucleus of our society.\u201d\nGerman newspaper Rheinische Post reports that Thuringian AfD politician Wiebke Muhsal said, \u201cChildren do not come from anywhere, but family is where a man and a woman have children together.\u201d Hamburg delegate Krzysztof Walczak added that formulating a guiding principle does not imply rejecting other ways of life and family models. On Sunday, the party voted to enshrine a so-called traditional definition of family\u2014consisting of a father, mother, and children\u2014into their platform. The move directly conflicts with Weidel\u2019s own family life. She shares a home in Switzerland with her female partner, Sarah Bossard, a Sri Lanka-born Swiss filmmaker, and their two young sons.\nWeidel is getting support from the wealthiest man in the world. She participated in a live-streamed interview on X (formerly Twitter) with tech billionaire Elon Musk on Thursday. According to NPR, roughly 200,000 users tuned in as Musk endorsed Weidel and praised her as \u201ca very reasonable person.\u201d Musk\u2019s alignment with the AfD has drawn international criticism, particularly given the party\u2019s classification as a suspected right-wing extremist group by Germany\u2019s domestic intelligence agency. During the chat, Musk urged Germans to support the AfD, warning that \u201cthings are going to get very much worse in Germany\u201d if they do not.\nWeidel, 45, has a doctorate in economics and spent six years in China, where she learned Mandarin and researched the country\u2019s pension system, Deutsche Welle reports. According to the outlet, she admires former British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher for her neoliberal policies and resilience, reflecting similar views in her own platform advocating welfare cuts and privatization.\nThe AfD\u2019s recent state election successes, particularly in Thuringia with nearly 33 percent of the vote, have bolstered its confidence. DW reports that national polls show the party at 20 percent, fueled by economic frustrations and dissatisfaction with the current government\u2019s immigration policies. Much like in the U.S., where President-elect Donald Trump is set to take power next Monday with his party controlling all arms of government largely because Americans are dissatisfied with the economy and immigration, Weidel is selling a populist message to gain support in Germany.",

            "content": "Following the German federal election on February 23, a new party could officially enter the German parliament, the Bundestag: the Sahra Wagenknecht Alliance, named after its firebrand founder, who split from the Left Party in 2023.Her eclectic mix of left-leaning economic policies, anti-migrant rhetoric, and a foreign policy that is pro-Russia, anti-Israel, and deeply distrustful of NATO has enabled the party to amass votes in recent elections.At the EU elections in June, it collected \u00a06% of the vote. And in regional elections in three eastern states in autumn, it became the third-strongest party, earning it a spot in the ruling coalitions in Brandenburg and Thuringia.

Technically, it already has ten seats in the Bundestag after Wagenknecht \u2013 a former co-leader of the Left Party and sitting member since 2009 \u2013 took nine defectors with her.Now, BSW will, for the first time, contest a national election, currently polling at between 4% and 6% (a 5% minimum is needed to enter the Bundestag). The Left Party, meanwhile, is trailing at just 3%-4%.The rise of BSWThe BSW\u2019s rise has been meteoric; its speed is unprecedented in German politics, and its politics are hard to define. But who is the woman behind it? And will Wagenknecht succeed in remaking Germany\u2019s political landscape? Sahra Wagenknecht, leader of Germany's Sahra Wagenknecht Alliance party (BSW), attends a one day party congress in Bonn, Germany, January 12, 2025 (credit: REUTERS)Wagenknecht is perhaps best described as an old-school leftist. She was born in 1969 in Jena under the state-socialist regime of East Germany, where she was a member of the youth organization Free German Youth as a teenager. She joined the ruling party, SED, in the final months before the Berlin Wall fell in 1989. And, in 1991, she became a member of the party executive committee of PDS, the SED\u2019s democratic-socialist successor, which fused with another party in 2007 to create the Left Party.After the wall fell, Wagenknecht idolized East Germany\u2019s past, fellow party members have said. In 2002, she voted against a PDS resolution that stated, \u201cThere is no justification for the dead at the [Berlin] Wall\u201d \u2013 referring to the state\u2019s policy of shooting those trying to flee to the West.Until 2010, she was a member of the Communist Platform within the PDS and later the Left Party, a group of orthodox Marxists who saw Stalinism in favorable terms.   Stay updated with the latest news! Subscribe to The Jerusalem Post Newsletter   Subscribe Now  Already in the 1990s, her positions were strongly criticized within the PDS. But she still rose to become a leading member of the Left Party in the 2010s, despite being seen as an increasingly polarizing, even unruly figure that openly challenged party consensus time and time again.A political iconAMONG SOME voters, however, especially in Germany\u2019s east, Wagenknecht became a political icon. Her sharp-tongued speeches delivered in elegant attire won her many fans.She once even donated one of her trademark colorful blouses to the Marxist newspaper Junge Welt to auction.When asked how many blouses she would give away to get back the old socialist regime in East Germany, she said: \u201cAll that I have, of course.\u201d Wagenknecht\u2019s bestselling books have further fueled her popularity. 2021\u2019s The Self-Righteous, which criticizes identity politics and \u201clifestyle leftists\u201d as privileged positions that do little to alleviate economic injustice, topped Der Spiegel\u2019s bestseller list, ignited a debate on the Left, and was lauded by right-wingers critical of \u201cwoke\u201d politics.Her books and speaking gigs have netted her handsome side earnings, amounting to \u20ac750,000 in 2023. Among them: \u20ac10,000 for a talk at Swiss Rock Asset Management and a further \u20ac10,000 for one at the Swiss Institute of International Studies. Only four members of the Bundestag earned more in addition to their parliamentary salaries than Wagenknecht that year.While still a member of the Left Party, she was criticized for often being absent from the Bundestag, with leading voices saying she should concentrate on her parliamentary work more. Many felt she put herself before her party.In many respects, the Sahra Wagenknecht Alliance is the logical conclusion of her cult of personality. One member has referred to her as the Kaiser of her new party. And with the help of some wealthy backers \u2013 the party received a donation of \u20ac5.1 million from a German hi-tech investor, the largest single party donation in German history \u2013 she has put her polarizing persona on the ballot.But even internally, many have criticized her authoritarian grip over her namesake party. Wagenknecht reportedly approves each member herself, keen to prevent \u201cunwanted\u201d activists from joining.Her anti-migrant rhetoric appeals to voters who might otherwise vote for the extreme-right AfD \u2013 and could be damaging to the party\u2019s image (the extreme-right magazine Compact featured her on the cover with the headline \u201cThe Best Chancellor,\u201d in 2022).However, Wagenknecht is also set on controlling the party\u2019s line, seemingly unwilling to compromise with other leftists. \u201cWith such a young party, we naturally have to be careful that other issues aren\u2019t suddenly able to gain majority support as the party grows,\u201d she told the German newspaper TAZ in July.As a result, BSW has surprisingly few members \u2013 just 1,000 across Germany. In some cities, it only has a single member, hindering an effective election campaign, as it relies on supporters whose membership applications are backlogged and who are growing increasingly frustrated due to the party\u2019s top-down approach.Remnants of communist daysPERHAPS THE strongest remnant of Wagenknecht\u2019s communist days is her anti-Western stance on foreign policy, critical of the US, NATO, and Israel. Wagenknecht herself markets BSW as a \u201cpeace party.\u201dJust days before Russian President Vladimir Putin launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, she said on a talk show that Russia \u201cdoes not have any interest in marching into Ukraine, of course not.\u201d Since then, she has repeatedly doubled down, denying Russian war crimes, amplifying Kremlin-aligned disinformation, and suggesting Ukraine should simply surrender.When Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky held a speech at the Bundestag in June, BSW left in protest \u2013 along with the AfD. Wagenknecht herself has never been to Ukraine as she fears she would be murdered there, she claims.Wagenknecht\u2019s anti-Israel stance has also earned her much criticism.When former prime minister and president Shimon Peres addressed the Bundestag in 2010 on the Day of Remembrance for the Victims of National Socialism, she and her now fellow BSW politician, Sevim Dagdelen, refused to stand up after his speech to applaud with all other members of the Bundestag, as Wagenknecht \u201ccannot show such respect to a statesman who himself is responsible for war,\u201d she later said.Since October 7, Wagenknecht has accused Israel\u2019s war against Hamas in Gaza of having the \u201ctraits of a campaign of annihilation,\u201d using the German word Vernichtungsfeldzug, often used in connection with the crimes of the Nazis.Her party has filed motions to block German arms exports to Israel and accused the German government of \u201caiding and abetting war crimes.\u201d But she has also repeatedly stressed she supports Israel\u2019s right to exist and condemned the Hamas-led attack against Israel.As a result, Germany\u2019s Central Council of Jews has strongly criticized Wagenknecht, with its president, Josef Schuster, saying in an interview in August that she \u201cfuels Israel-hatred in Germany with rather populist positions\u201d and has a \u201ctendency towards conspiracy theories.\u201dBSW was the only party to vote against a resolution against antisemitism passed in the Bundestag in November. And after Maccabi Tel Aviv soccer fans were hunted through the streets of Amsterdam in the same month, a leading member of BSW, Klaus Ernst, claimed on X/Twitter that the Mossad was allegedly among them, as he sought to blame the Israeli fans for the violence against them.On the eve of Germany\u2019s next federal election, BSW\u2019s prospects are still far from certain. Despite initial euphoria following a string of strong election results in eastern Germany and on the EU level, support is waning.Until the current coalition \u2013 comprised of Social Democrats, Greens, and the pro-business FDP \u2013 crumbled, BSW was consistently polling at 8%, a strong showing for a first-time party. But whether it will clear the 5% threshold needed to enter the Bundestag is now unclear, recent data show.One reason is that Wagenknecht has been conspicuously absent from the campaign trail, so far, organizing few events. The surprise election caught BSW off guard, which had banked on more time to raise funds and consolidate its nascent structure. Another is the structure itself: Media reports critical of the strictly hierarchical organization and its authoritarian style of management have done it few favors.By founding a party named after herself, Wagenknecht has put her personal brand on the ballot on February 23. But whether Germany will vote to extend the Sahra Wagenknecht show for another season will be a close call. TheJerusalem Post approached Sahra Wagenknecht for comment but received no response as of press time.\nHer eclectic mix of left-leaning economic policies, anti-migrant rhetoric, and a foreign policy that is pro-Russia, anti-Israel, and deeply distrustful of NATO has enabled the party to amass votes in recent elections.At the EU elections in June, it collected \u00a06% of the vote.

But whether Germany will vote to extend the Sahra Wagenknecht show for another season will be a close call. TheJerusalem Post approached Sahra Wagenknecht for comment but received no response as of press time.\nWagenknecht is perhaps best described as an old-school leftist. She was born in 1969 in Jena under the state-socialist regime of East Germany, where she was a member of the youth organization Free German Youth as a teenager. She joined the ruling party, SED, in the final months before the Berlin Wall fell in 1989. And, in 1991, she became a member of the party executive committee of PDS, the SED\u2019s democratic-socialist successor, which fused with another party in 2007 to create the Left Party.After the wall fell, Wagenknecht idolized East Germany\u2019s past, fellow party members have said. In 2002, she voted against a PDS resolution that stated, \u201cThere is no justification for the dead at the [Berlin] Wall\u201d \u2013 referring to the state\u2019s policy of shooting those trying to flee to the West.Until 2010, she was a member of the Communist Platform within the PDS and later the Left Party, a group of orthodox Marxists who saw Stalinism in favorable terms.

But she still rose to become a leading member of the Left Party in the 2010s, despite being seen as an increasingly polarizing, even unruly figure that openly challenged party consensus time and time again.A political iconAMONG SOME voters, however, especially in Germany\u2019s east, Wagenknecht became a political icon. Her sharp-tongued speeches delivered in elegant attire won her many fans.She once even donated one of her trademark colorful blouses to the Marxist newspaper Junge Welt to auction.When asked how many blouses she would give away to get back the old socialist regime in East Germany, she said: \u201cAll that I have, of course.\u201d Wagenknecht\u2019s bestselling books have further fueled her popularity. 2021\u2019s The Self-Righteous, which criticizes identity politics and \u201clifestyle leftists\u201d as privileged positions that do little to alleviate economic injustice, topped Der Spiegel\u2019s bestseller list, ignited a debate on the Left, and was lauded by right-wingers critical of \u201cwoke\u201d politics.Her books and speaking gigs have netted her handsome side earnings, amounting to \u20ac750,000 in 2023. Among them: \u20ac10,000 for a talk at Swiss Rock Asset Management and a further \u20ac10,000 for one at the Swiss Institute of International Studies. Only four members of the Bundestag earned more in addition to their parliamentary salaries than Wagenknecht that year.While still a member of the Left Party, she was criticized for often being absent from the Bundestag, with leading voices saying she should concentrate on her parliamentary work more.

One member has referred to her as the Kaiser of her new party. And with the help of some wealthy backers \u2013 the party received a donation of \u20ac5.1 million from a German hi-tech investor, the largest single party donation in German history \u2013 she has put her polarizing persona on the ballot.But even internally, many have criticized her authoritarian grip over her namesake party. Wagenknecht reportedly approves each member herself, keen to prevent \u201cunwanted\u201d activists from joining.Her anti-migrant rhetoric appeals to voters who might otherwise vote for the extreme-right AfD \u2013 and could be damaging to the party\u2019s image (the extreme-right magazine Compact featured her on the cover with the headline \u201cThe Best Chancellor,\u201d in 2022).However, Wagenknecht is also set on controlling the party\u2019s line, seemingly unwilling to compromise with other leftists. \u201cWith such a young party, we naturally have to be careful that other issues aren\u2019t suddenly able to gain majority support as the party grows,\u201d she told the German newspaper TAZ in July.As a result, BSW has surprisingly few members \u2013 just 1,000 across Germany. In some cities, it only has a single member, hindering an effective election campaign, as it relies on supporters whose membership applications are backlogged and who are growing increasingly frustrated due to the party\u2019s top-down approach.Remnants of communist daysPERHAPS THE strongest remnant of Wagenknecht\u2019s communist days is her anti-Western stance on foreign policy, critical of the US, NATO, and Israel.

Despite initial euphoria following a string of strong election results in eastern Germany and on the EU level, support is waning.Until the current coalition \u2013 comprised of Social Democrats, Greens, and the pro-business FDP \u2013 crumbled, BSW was consistently polling at 8%, a strong showing for a first-time party. But whether it will clear the 5% threshold needed to enter the Bundestag is now unclear, recent data show.One reason is that Wagenknecht has been conspicuously absent from the campaign trail, so far, organizing few events. The surprise election caught BSW off guard, which had banked on more time to raise funds and consolidate its nascent structure. Another is the structure itself: Media reports critical of the strictly hierarchical organization and its authoritarian style of management have done it few favors.By founding a party named after herself, Wagenknecht has put her personal brand on the ballot on February 23. But whether Germany will vote to extend the Sahra Wagenknecht show for another season will be a close call. TheJerusalem Post approached Sahra Wagenknecht for comment but received no response as of press time.\nStay updated with the latest news!\nSubscribe to The Jerusalem Post Newsletter\nAlready in the 1990s, her positions were strongly criticized within the PDS. But she still rose to become a leading member of the Left Party in the 2010s, despite being seen as an increasingly polarizing, even unruly figure that openly challenged party consensus time and time again.A political iconAMONG SOME voters, however, especially in Germany\u2019s east, Wagenknecht became a political icon. Her sharp-tongued speeches delivered in elegant attire won her many fans.She once even donated one of her trademark colorful blouses to the Marxist newspaper Junge Welt to auction.When asked how many blouses she would give away to get back the old socialist regime in East Germany, she said: \u201cAll that I have, of course.\u201d Wagenknecht\u2019s bestselling books have further fueled her popularity. 2021\u2019s The Self-Righteous, which criticizes identity politics and \u201clifestyle leftists\u201d as privileged positions that do little to alleviate economic injustice, topped Der Spiegel\u2019s bestseller list, ignited a debate on the Left, and was lauded by right-wingers critical of \u201cwoke\u201d politics.Her books and speaking gigs have netted her handsome side earnings, amounting to \u20ac750,000 in 2023. Among them: \u20ac10,000 for a talk at Swiss Rock Asset Management and a further \u20ac10,000 for one at the Swiss Institute of International Studies. Only four members of the Bundestag earned more in addition to their parliamentary salaries than Wagenknecht that year.While still a member of the Left Party, she was criticized for often being absent from the Bundestag, with leading voices saying she should concentrate on her parliamentary work more. Many felt she put herself before her party.In many respects, the Sahra Wagenknecht Alliance is the logical conclusion of her cult of personality. One member has referred to her as the Kaiser of her new party. And with the help of some wealthy backers \u2013 the party received a donation of \u20ac5.1 million from a German hi-tech investor, the largest single party donation in German history \u2013 she has put her polarizing persona on the ballot.But even internally, many have criticized her authoritarian grip over her namesake party. Wagenknecht reportedly approves each member herself, keen to prevent \u201cunwanted\u201d activists from joining.Her anti-migrant rhetoric appeals to voters who might otherwise vote for the extreme-right AfD \u2013 and could be damaging to the party\u2019s image (the extreme-right magazine Compact featured her on the cover with the headline \u201cThe Best Chancellor,\u201d in 2022).However, Wagenknecht is also set on controlling the party\u2019s line, seemingly unwilling to compromise with other leftists. \u201cWith such a young party, we naturally have to be careful that other issues aren\u2019t suddenly able to gain majority support as the party grows,\u201d she told the German newspaper TAZ in July.As a result, BSW has surprisingly few members \u2013 just 1,000 across Germany. In some cities, it only has a single member, hindering an effective election campaign, as it relies on supporters whose membership applications are backlogged and who are growing increasingly frustrated due to the party\u2019s top-down approach.Remnants of communist daysPERHAPS THE strongest remnant of Wagenknecht\u2019s communist days is her anti-Western stance on foreign policy, critical of the US, NATO, and Israel. Wagenknecht herself markets BSW as a \u201cpeace party.\u201dJust days before Russian President Vladimir Putin launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, she said on a talk show that Russia \u201cdoes not have any interest in marching into Ukraine, of course not.\u201d Since then, she has repeatedly doubled down, denying Russian war crimes, amplifying Kremlin-aligned disinformation, and suggesting Ukraine should simply surrender.When Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky held a speech at the Bundestag in June, BSW left in protest \u2013 along with the AfD. Wagenknecht herself has never been to Ukraine as she fears she would be murdered there, she claims.Wagenknecht\u2019s anti-Israel stance has also earned her much criticism.When former prime minister and president Shimon Peres addressed the Bundestag in 2010 on the Day of Remembrance for the Victims of National Socialism, she and her now fellow BSW politician, Sevim Dagdelen, refused to stand up after his speech to applaud with all other members of the Bundestag, as Wagenknecht \u201ccannot show such respect to a statesman who himself is responsible for war,\u201d she later said.Since October 7, Wagenknecht has accused Israel\u2019s war against Hamas in Gaza of having the \u201ctraits of a campaign of annihilation,\u201d using the German word Vernichtungsfeldzug, often used in connection with the crimes of the Nazis.Her party has filed motions to block German arms exports to Israel and accused the German government of \u201caiding and abetting war crimes.\u201d But she has also repeatedly stressed she supports Israel\u2019s right to exist and condemned the Hamas-led attack against Israel.As a result, Germany\u2019s Central Council of Jews has strongly criticized Wagenknecht, with its president, Josef Schuster, saying in an interview in August that she \u201cfuels Israel-hatred in Germany with rather populist positions\u201d and has a \u201ctendency towards conspiracy theories.\u201dBSW was the only party to vote against a resolution against antisemitism passed in the Bundestag in November.

            "content": "The former leader of Germany's socialist Left party is aiming to get her eponymous Sahra Wagenknecht Alliance into the Bundestag in its first federal election in February. Polls suggest that she may fail.\nThe new Sahra Wagenknecht Alliance (BSW)\u00a0is finalizing its campaign platform at Sunday's\u00a0party conference\u00a0in Bonn. Founded to much media fanfare in January 2024, the party\u00a0enjoyed a significant winning streak in its first year.\nFounded by the\u00a0former leader of the socialist\u00a0Left party\u00a0and composed mostly of former members, too, the BSW went on to achieve double-digit results in three state elections. In the eastern states of Brandenburg and Thuringia, the party is already a coalition partner in\u00a0the provincial governments.\nNow, the BSW is seeking to enter the Bundestag in the general election scheduled for February 23, 2025, for which it will need to garner at least 5% of the vote. That's a tall order as it will be hard to find enough candidates among\u00a0only 1,000 party members, a result of the strict scrutiny applied to people who want to join the alliance.\nCurrently, 10 lawmakers represent the BSW in the Bundestag, Germany's lower house of parliament. They all won their seats in 2021\u00a0as candidates for the Left party. In 2025, they are running for the BSW. According to the latest poll in Germany, the party is polling at around\u00a05%.\nShould\u00a0Wagenknecht\u00a0and her alliance make it into the Bundestag\u00a0\u2014 parties in Germany must secure at least 5% of the vote to enter the federal parliament\u00a0\u2014\u00a0it would probably be as an opposition party. The main obstacle to building a coalition at the national level is the BSW's position on support for Ukraine in defending itself\u00a0against Russia's invasion\u00a0.\u00a0The BSW is calling for an end to German arms deliveries to Ukraine, an unacceptable position for the potential governing parties: the center-right Christian Democrats (CDU) and Christian Social Union (CSU), center-left Social Democrats (SPD) and\u00a0Greens. As all other parties have done, the BSW has ruled out forming a coalition with the far-right\u00a0Alternative for Germany (AfD).\nThe BSW and Left party have a lot of overlap\u00a0on economic and social policy. However, they disagree fundamentally on asylum\u00a0policy. The Left party does not seek further restrictions on\u00a0immigration, while the BSW advocates more deterrence to keep displaced people from arriving to Germany in large numbers.\nThe BSW and the Left both object to heavy\u00a0military support for Ukraine and\u00a0Israel\u00a0and are skeptical of\u00a0NATO.\nTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video\nBoth the Left party and the BSW warn that Germany could be dragged into a war. \"We need a German government that does everything it can to reduce this threat,\" Wagenknecht says at campaign events.\nThe 55-year-old is a fixture on\u00a0political TV talk shows in Germany and she is firmly convinced that she will make it into the Bundestag. \"In the best-case scenario, we even have the opportunity to help shape a government,\" Wagenknecht has said.\nAn economist who was raised in communist-ruled\u00a0East Germany, Wagenknecht describes her party as breaking the mold of traditional political classifications. She believes that people don't even know what labels such as \"left\" and \"right\" mean.\nShe has also argued against stonewalling the AfD. In 2023, she\u00a0said it was wrong to deride all AfD supporters as \"Nazis.\" \"They are simply conservative people who used to be in the CDU,\" she said back then.\nThis article was originally written in German.\nWhile you're here: Every Tuesday, DW editors round up what is happening in German politics and society.

In the west, support for the BSW is significantly lower.\nThis was already evident in the European elections in June, when the BSW received 6.2% of the German vote. The regional differences were huge: In eastern states, support ranged from roughly 13% to 16%, but in western states the BSW averaged well below 5%. Only in the small state of Saarland (1 million inhabitants) and in the city-state of Bremen (580,000 inhabitants) did it surpass this threshold.\nThe BSW is looking at similar figures in the upcoming Bundestag elections.

Many people do not yet know who they want to vote for, Wagenknecht said. \"We are only just getting started in this campaign.\" The party platform adopted at the convention will now lay the groundwork.\nIn this newly-minted manifesto, the BSW describes itself as the only \"peace party\" in the German Bundestag that is consistent in its opposition to the current buildup in arms as well as the supply of weapons into war zones.\nThat has, however, long been a core tenet of the socialist Left Party, on which Wagenknecht and many of her long-standing supporters have turned their backs.\nThe reason for the split was their opposing views on asylum and migration policy. While the Left Party is the only party represented in the Bundestag that opposes adopting stricter asylum policies, the BSW demands, among other things, that asylum procedures be carried out outside the European Union in so-called safe third countries and that criminal refugees be deported.\nIn terms of its content and rhetoric, some passages in the BSW's electoral program resemble that of other parties, including the Alternative for Germany (AfD), a party with far-right extremist elements.\nThe BSW program criticizes the \"uncontrolled influx of people,\" and claims that little is known about the biographies of these immigrants or their willingness to integrate. \"The naive policy of welcoming immigrants in recent years has already led to a disproportionate increase in knife crime, sexual offenses, and religiously-motivated terrorism,\" the BSW election manifesto claims.\nOn the question of how Russia's war in Ukraine should be ended, there is some overlap with the Left Party. The BSW wants a ceasefire without preconditions, and is warning against stumbling into a new arms race. \"We must not prepare for war in the nuclear age,\" Wagenknecht said. \"A new policy of de-escalation is needed.

German military spending has more than doubled since 2014 and amounted to almost \u20ac90 billion ($92 billion) in 2024.\"\nGermany has now reached the target agreed upon by the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) of investing 2% of its economic output in its defense budget.\nIf the BSW and its official chancellor candidate Sahra Wagenknecht had their way, Germany would disarm. It is questionable whether the new party will be able to commit to this in the next Bundestag, and if the BSW fails to enter the Bundestag at all, it would be a personal defeat for its founder.\nMeanwhile, the Left Party, Wagenknecht's former party, may even be able to make it into the Bundestag without crossing the 5% hurdle.

            "content": "U.S. President-elect Donald Trump speaks after a meeting with Republicans in Congress at the U.S. Capitol building in Washington, U.S. January 8, 2025. REUTERS/Jeenah Moon\n    Less than 24 hours after Donald Trump was elected president of the United States in November 2024, the German state-owned news service Deutsche Welle published an article with the headline \u201cTrump\u2019s election victory is a nightmare for Germany.\u201d\n\t\tA few hours later, Germany\u2019s chancellor, Olaf Scholz, \n\tannounced that his three-party political coalition had collapsed. Disagreements about how to help strengthen Germany\u2019s weak economy were a major factor, but Scholz mentioned that the U.S. election outcome also fueled the coalition breaking up.\n\n\t\tOne month later, Scholz lost a confidence vote, ending the government he has led since 2021. Germany will have \n\tfederal elections on Feb. 23, 2025.\n\n\t\tGermany is considered one of the United States\u2019 \n\tclosest allies in Western Europe, partnering on everything from economic trade to military defense.\n\n\t\tBut this might change with Trump returning to office. As Angela Merkel, the longtime former chancellor of Germany, \n\tsaid in November 2024, the looming second Trump presidency \u201cis a challenge to the world, especially for multilateralism.\u201d Indeed, Trump\u2019s U.S.-centric approach to international affairs runs counter to multilateralism, which is the idea that different countries working together helps everyone involved.\n\n\t\tAs \n\tsomeone who researches\u00a0German-American relations in the 20th century, I share German politicians\u2019 worries that the incoming Trump administration poses a serious threat to the relationship.\n\n\t\tThe German concerns include Trump potentially launching a \n\ttariff-induced trade war, as well as the possibility of the president-elect withdrawing financial and military support for Ukraine in its war against Russia. Both scenarios would further hurt the weak German economy \u2013 especially since, following the U.S. and the European Union, Germany is the third-largest donor to Ukraine and would be required to shoulder even more of this financial support if the U.S. stopped giving Ukraine money.\n\n\t\tGerman politicians also \n\tremain dumbfounded by Trump\u2019s particular style of politics, despite the fact that he already served as president.\n\n\t\tMerkel wrote in her \n\t2024 memoir \u201cFreedom: Memoirs 1954-2021\u201d that when she first met Trump in 2017, she acted as though she were having a conversation with \u201csomeone completely normal.\u201d Merkel quickly realized, though, that Trump was not like other American politicians. She observed that Trump seemed to think all countries competed and the success of one meant the failure of another.A long-lasting alliance\n\t\tThat was not the type of American president Merkel and other Germans were used to. Merkel was born in 1954, when Germany was split into two countries: communist, Soviet-aligned East Germany, where Merkel grew up, and capitalist West Germany, which was formed out of the three western sectors controlled by France, the U.S. and the United Kingdom at the end of World War II and was aligned with the U.S.\n\n\t\tThe U.S. embraced West Germany as \n\tan important ally shortly after the war. This alliance helped the U.S. make sure that Germany, not too long ago an enemy of the U.S. during World War II, would never again become a threat to world peace.\n\n\t\tWest Germany also served as an important front line in Europe as the U.S. navigated the Cold War with the Soviet Union starting in 1947.\n\n\t\tWest Germany, meanwhile, appreciated the power of having an American \u00fcberpartner during the Cold War, especially since West Germany flourished economically during most of the conflict. East Germany\u2019s economy, on the other hand, was relatively weak throughout the Cold War.\n\n\t\tPerhaps the most visible symbol of Germany\u2019s division was the Berlin Wall, a 96-mile partition that cut through Berlin. East German authorities \n\tbuilt the wall in 1961 in order to prevent East Germans from fleeing to West Germany.\n\n\t\tIt was only after the Berlin Wall fell in November 1989, symbolizing the looming end of the Cold War that year and opening up the possibility for German unification, that Merkel entered politics.\nUnified Germany and the United States\n\t\tAs a politician in the 1990s, Merkel witnessed how then-President George H.W. Bush convinced France and the United Kingdom to put aside their fears about a new German dominance over Europe and allow their former World War II enemy to unify and gain full sovereignty.\n\n\t\tThe four main Allied powers of World War II in Europe \u2013 the United Kingdom, U.S., Soviet Union and France \u2013 had initially denied Germany the right to sovereignty after the end of the war.\n\n\t\tBut in 1990, the four Allies signed the \n\tTwo Plus Four Treaty \u2013 an international agreement that allowed Germany to unify as a fully sovereign state in October 1990.\n\n\t\tImmediately afterward, Bush \n\tpraised the transatlantic alliance between the U.S. and Germany. The American president emphasized the two countries\u2019 common \u201clove of freedom\u201d and expressed his hope that they become \u201cpartners in leadership.\u201d\n\n\t\tBush\u2019s words signaled an important turnaround in the international expectations of Germany, and the need for it to become a more influential political and military player in world politics. It was a turnaround, however, that many Germans did not necessarily welcome. Germans felt reluctant to step into the powerful leadership role that the U.S. expected of the country.\n\n\t\tAt the time, there was a common belief in Germany that \n\tmilitary restraint had finally made their country a stable and prosperous one, following two devastating wars.\n\n\t\tIn fact, in almost all the global crises since 1990 \u2013 from the \n\twar in Bosnia in 1992 to Russia\u2019s annexation of Crimea in 2014 \u2013 Germany has shown a reluctance to take the lead. Instead, Germany prefers a secondary role in navigating international conflicts, primarily through its membership with the military coalition NATO and the United Nations.\nGermany\u2019s international position today\n\t\tAfter Russia launched a full invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, Germany\u2019s approach to international conflicts dramatically changed, and it finally stepped into the leadership role envisioned by Bush in 1990. In a historic speech on Feb. 27, 2022, \n\tScholz called the attack a \u201cZeitenwende\u201d, meaning \u201ca watershed era\u201d in German, and announced a significant increase in military spending.\n\n\t\tThe U.S. and \n\tother Western allies have welcomed this shift.\n\n\t\tWhile NATO members had already agreed to \n\tinvest a minimum of 2% of their gross domestic product in defense spending in 2006, Germany \u2013 like other European countries \u2013 did not meet this commitment for many years.\n\n\t\tIt was \n\tonly in February 2024 that Germany finally achieved its 2% spending target for the first time in the wake of the ongoing Russian war against Ukraine.\n\n\t\tThat it did so was not just a result of that conflict.\n\n\t\tPressure by American presidents, above all Trump, also played a major role. Trump\u2019s continuous threat throughout his first presidency to \u201c\n\tpay your bills or we leave NATO\u201d had apparently paid off.\n\n\t\tIt will be up to the new German government to remind Trump of the history of German-American relations and the many benefits of the transatlantic alliance between the two powers since 1945.\n\tSylvia Taschka, Professor of Teaching of History, Wayne State University\n\t\tThis article is republished from \n\tThe Conversation under a Creative Commons license.

            "summary": "German politicians are divided in their responses to Donald Trump's second presidency. Chancellor Olaf Scholz congratulated Trump, emphasizing transatlantic cooperation, while opposition leader Friedrich Merz of the CDU aims for a more conciliatory approach, advocating for a united European front. In contrast, the far-right AfD party embraces Trump and even attended his inauguration. A leaked diplomatic cable from Germany's ambassador criticized Trump, raising concerns over German-American relations.

Merkel stresses the importance of US partnership amid ongoing geopolitical tensions.",
            "content": "While leading German politicians fear the worst from Trump's second presidency, German parties are taking very different approaches to him. The nationalist AfD is delighted \u2014 and was even invited to Trump's inauguration.\nWhether threatening to end\u00a0climate protection policies and\u00a0slap import tariffs on EU goods or envisioning a new imperialism that lays claim to the Panama Canal and Greenland, Donald Trump has been confirming all\u00a0the worst fears of many German politicians.\nDespite this, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz congratulated the new US president on his inauguration.\nWishing him \"strength and success\" for the tasks ahead, he added that, \"[t]ogether, we can provide crucial momentum on both sides of the Atlantic for freedom, peace and security, as well as\u00a0prosperity and economic development.\"\nBut Scholz was not present in Washington, nor was Germany's opposition leader Friedrich Merz from the conservative Christian Democratic Union (CDU). Trump had only invited politically like-minded politicians, such as Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni and Argentine President Javier Milei.\nMost German politicians had either hinted or openly stated that they would much rather have seen the Democratic candidate,\u00a0Kamala Harris, enter the White House.\nOnly Germany's far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) party seems to be looking forward to another\u00a0Trump administration. Trump loyalist\u00a0Elon Musk\u00a0openly endorsed the AfD\u00a0on his platform X when he wrote that, \"[o]nly the AfD can save Germany\" and called Scholz an \"incompetent fool.\"\nNow, a sensitive assessment by Germany's ambassador to the US, Andreas Michaelis, has contributed to heightened transatlantic tensions. It was a diplomatic cable, intended for German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock and\u00a0leaked to the media, containing\u00a0strident criticism of Trump.\nIn it, the ambassador\u00a0 stated that Trump was pursuing an agenda of \"maximum disruption,\"\u00a0and largely undermining\u00a0basic democratic principles and the US system of checks and balances.\nThe German chancellor candidate for the center-right CDU, Friedrich Merz, considers the paper to be a disaster for German-American relations.\n\"This is a huge blow to the German government's reputation in Washington. No one from this federal government will be able to find an interlocutor in Washington any time soon,\" Merz said in an interview on the German broadcaster Deutschlandfunk.\nWhereas Chancellor Scholz has adopted a confrontational stance and sharply criticized Trump's claim to Greenland, Friedrich Merz has been more forthcoming.\nAccording to opinion polls, Merz has a good chance of becoming Germany's next chancellor after the upcoming elections on February 23. In this case, he would have to deal directly with Trump as head of the German government.\nMerz has said that he intends to meet Trump \"at eye level\" and focus\u00a0on \"bundling European interests.\"\n\"As long as the European member states stand together, they will be respected in the world, including in the US. As long as they are divided, no one will take us seriously,\" Merz stated at a Berlin summit of center-right European parties.\u00a0\"So, in my view, this is the final call to action.\"\nIn a hand-written congratulatory letter to Trump, Merz further wrote that, \"should the German people give me a mandate for the chancellorship, it will be one of my priorities to work with you towards a new chapter in our relations.\"\nThe German Chamber of\u00a0Commerce and Industry, or DIHK, has already warned of serious consequences in view of the threat of US import tariffs. \"The effects of new US tariffs would be serious for the German economy,\" DIHK Chief Executive Helena Melnikov told the German newspaper Rheinische Post.\nIn Germany, every fourth job depends on exports, and every second job is industrial, she pointed out.\nThat's why, in contrast to Merz, Germany's Minister of Economic Affairs Robert Habeck from the\u00a0Green party is taking a more combative stance:\u00a0\"Europe is prepared. If the Americans impose tariffs, which I neither hope nor want, Europe would certainly be in a position to take countermeasures, including those that affect the American economy,\" Habeck said in an interview with DW.\nHabeck, whose responsibilities also include\u00a0climate action, called Trump's announced withdrawal from the Paris climate\u00a0agreement\u00a0\"a fatal signal for the world.\"\nBut at home, too, he has had to watch issues of climate protection get pushed further and further down the agenda during the ongoing election campaign.\nWhen she was German chancellor, Angela Merkel from the CDU dealt with Trump during his first presidency. Now, she has once again spoken out in favor of continuing a close partnership with the US.\nIn her recently published memoirs, the long-time politician\u00a0openly expressed the difficulties she had with Trump at the time.\nAt her party's New Year's reception,\u00a0Merkel argued that Germany's transatlantic partnership with the US was more indispensable today than several years ago. She added that it was only possible \"to achieve that [Russian President Vladimir]\u00a0Putin does not win the war and that Ukraine remains an independent state\" with the help of the US and within the NATO alliance.\nTrump has indicated that he wants to end support\u00a0for Ukraine and instead seek a quick end to the war with Putin. There are fears that Ukraine will have to make territorial concessions to achieve this.\nMeanwhile, the far-right AfD, which remains isolated in the German parliament, sees itself on an upswing thanks to Trump.\nThe AfD and Trump are close on issues of migration and energy policy. However, the AfD also repeatedly makes anti-American statements. Nevertheless, Trump's closeness to the AfD was apparent in Washington: While Federal Chancellor Olaf Scholz was not invited to the inauguration, two prominent AfD politicians, Tino Chrupalla and Beatrix von Storch, were present.\nTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video\nThis article was originally published in German.",

            "content": "An election poster for German Chancellor Olaf Scholz with the message 'More for you. Better for Germany' (Tobias Schwarz/AFP)\n    by Frank ZellerDonald Trump's return to the White House has darkened the mood in Germany a month before elections, as multiple crises shake the foundations on which Europe's biggest economy built its post-war prosperity. Russia's war in Ukraine drove up energy prices, hammering the German economy just as Chinese demand for its exports has waned, while Trump's comeback throws doubt on the future of the NATO security umbrella. Chancellor Olaf Scholz's three-party coalition buckled under the cascading challenges and broke apart on November 6, the day Trump won re-election, hurtling Germany into turmoil and towards early elections on February 23.\"The word 'crisis' doesn't begin to capture the magnitude of the challenges Germany faces,\" said analyst Michael Broening. \"The country is being forced to redefine its economic, energy and security foundations.\"The strong election frontrunner so far is conservative Friedrich Merz, the leader of Angela Merkel's CDU, who brings business world experience but, at age 69, is as yet untested in any government leadership post.His CDU-CSU alliance is polling at around 30 percent, strongly ahead by about 15 percent of Scholz's Social Democrats (SPD), which would spell the labour party's worst showing since World War II.Embattled Scholz hopes for a late-campaign surge against Merz -- whose personal popularity ratings are low -- like the comeback that propelled the SPD leader to victory in 2021 when he took over from Merkel.Merz has pledged to revive Germany's battered political and economic standing after \"three lost years\" under Scholz and his allies the Greens and, until last year's bust-up, the liberal Free Democrats.- Far-right rising -A long-term rival to centrist Merkel, Merz has vowed to return the CDU to its conservative roots, with tight border controls, a tough law and order drive, and steps to get ailing Germany Inc back on its feet.He has voiced confidence that he can manage relations with the mercurial US president, but faces a tough charm offensive ahead after Team Trump has openly courted Germany's far right.Tech billionaire Elon Musk has trolled Scholz on his X platform and implored Germans to vote for the anti-immigration Alternative for Germany (AfD) party, which is polling around 20 percent.If the rise of a right-wing extremist party breaks a political taboo in Germany, which has been at pains to atone for Word War II and the Holocaust, support for the AfD from Washington has stunned Berlin.More potential havoc lies ahead for Germany and its economy if Trump makes good on his threat to levy high tariffs on imports.Economists have warned that such protectionist measures could spell a blow hard enough to wipe one percent off Germany's gross domestic product and kill 300,000 jobs.Trump has also demanded NATO allies step up defense spending to as high as five percent of GDP -- equating to 100 billion euros a year for Germany, which it can ill afford.- 'On the wrong foot' -Merz's Bavarian ally, CSU leader Markus Soeder, said the second Trump administration \"will be a difficult test because one can feel the growing distance to Europe, and especially to Germany\".Given Germany's dire economic troubles, he told Welt TV, this is hitting the country \"absolutely on the wrong foot\".Germany, as a strong military backer of Ukraine, also faces a hostile Russia which it accuses of waging a \"hybrid war\" ranging from spy drones and severed Baltic Sea cables to online election interference.Other unknown risks lie ahead, including a feared scenario where Trump would strike a Ukraine peace deal with Russian President Vladimir Putin over the heads of Kyiv and its EU allies.As both Putin and Trump seek to \"make their countries great again,\" wrote the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung, \"we are experiencing a paradigm shift in territorial policy that fundamentally questions the current world order\".Jacob Ross of the German Council on Foreign Relations said he was certain that \"Trump will continue to single out Germany as the favourite victim in this blame game against Europe\".Meanwhile, the fragmentation of Germany's political landscape threatens to complicate the post-election coalition building process, which could drag on for weeks or even months.Whoever leads Germany next will have to convince voters they have the answers to the myriad challenges. \"If any of the top candidates possess a convincing blueprint to lead the country out of this quagmire, they have so far failed to convince the public,\" said Broening of the Friedrich Ebert Foundation. \"With no single candidate enjoying anything close to widespread popularity, German voters seem less focused on hoping for the best and more intent on avoiding the worst.\"fz-ylf/yad/lb\u00a9 Agence France-PresseTrump News",

            "content": "Friedrich Merz said a new push for a free trade deal with the US could \"prevent a dangerous spiral of tariffs.\" The opposition Christian Democrat leader hopes to become chancellor after February's early elections.\nThe conservative Christian Democratic Union (CDU) candidate for chancellor, and apparent frontrunner for early elections in February in Germany, Friedrich Merz, has called for a \"positive agenda\" on trade\u00a0with the US and returning President Donald Trump.\n\"We need a positive agenda with the US that benefits American and European consumers alike,\" Merz said in an interview with the German dpa news agency published on Thursday.\nHe even recommended considering renewed attempts at an EU-US free trade deal, after the previous efforts, dubbed TTIP, were put on ice in 2017, early in Trump's first term.\n\"A new European-American inititative for joint free trade could prevent a dangerous spiral of tariffs,\" Merz said.\nHowever, Merz also made clear he did anticipate more difficult conditions for European economies after Trump's January 20 inauguration.\nHe said it likely made sense to prepare for the US focusing more on itself and its own perceived interests, for instance via higher import tariffs, as Trump repeatedly said he would during and since\u00a0the election campaign.\n\"But our answer to that should not be: 'Now we'll start with our tariffs too,'\" Merz said.\nMerz also said that Germany needed to gradually reduce its corporation tax rates towards 25%, with current levels nearer 30%. He said this would tackle non-wage labor costs and make the country an attractive place to do business again.\nThen, he said, Germany could\u00a0tell the United States: \"Yes, we are ready to face this competition with you as well.\"\nThe US is Germany's most successful export market at roughly 10% of all its foreign sales or \u20ac157.9 billion (roughly $163.5 billion) in 2023. The figure continued rising in 2024, based on partial data.\nTariffs could therefore have serious implications for the German economy, or at least parts of it.\nMeanwhile, the US is the third most common source for\u00a0German imports \u2014 well behind China, and slightly behind the neighboring Netherlands \u2014\u00a0accounting for about 7% of German imports, or \u20ac94.7 billion.\nTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video\nThis means Germany has a record annual\u00a0trade surplus with the US of a little over \u20ac63 billion that has been rising slightly in the past few years.\nOne statistic absent from this count, however, is the US also being the most common site for direct investment by German companies.\nTrump has often lamented this imbalance in bilateral trade, particularly during the election campaign. In several interviews he recalled supposed conversations with previous Chancellor Angela Merkel where he had complained about how few US cars were sold in Germany, for instance, compared to German ones in the US.\nmsh/wd (dpa, Reuters)",

As head of the Christian Democratic Union, he leads in polls ahead of the upcoming German election. His stance contrasts with outgoing Chancellor Olaf Scholz, particularly regarding China, potentially aligning Germany closer to France's tougher trade policies. France's Trade Minister Laurent Saint-Martin expressed cautious optimism about Merz, emphasizing the need for a strong Franco-German partnership and addressing ongoing trade tensions within the EU.",
            "content": "Christian Democrat Friedrich Merz hopes to revive talks on a broad trade deal with the U.S.\nAI generated Text-to-speech\nBRUSSELS \u2014 Maybe the Franco-German economic engine will soon sputter back to life after all.\nGermany\u2019s likely next chancellor, Friedrich Merz, can be good news for the European Union, France\u2019s newly appointed Trade Minister Laurent Saint-Martin told POLITICO, after years of friction between Paris and Berlin and looming fractures across the bloc over how to deal with the United States and China.\n\u201cWe can also look at the rather pro-European character of this would-be chancellor \u2026 There are also good reasons to be optimistic,\u201d Saint-Martin said on a visit to Brussels on Friday, in one of his first interviews since taking over the portfolio in late December.\n\u201cWhat\u2019s certain is that France\u2019s position on this issue will not change: We need a strong Germany, [which, together] with France, thinks about a Europe that invests; in a Europe that protects; and a Europe that once again thinks about its industrial future and its own sovereignty,\u201d he said.\nMuch will depend on the result of the early German election on Feb. 23, Saint-Martin cautioned.\nMerz and his center-right Christian Democratic Union currently lead on 31 percent, well ahead of Chancellor Olaf Scholz\u2019s center-left Social Democratic Party on 16 percent, according to POLITICO\u2019s Poll of Polls. Scholz\u2019s \u201ctraffic light\u201d coalition of Greens, Social Democrats and the Free Democratic Party collapsed in November amid acrimony over spending and economic reforms.\nThe far-right Alternative for Germany is polling in second place on 20 percent, but Merz is clear he will never enter into a coalition with the populist, anti-immigrant party.\nThe CDU leader said last week that the EU should reconsider sealing a broad trade deal with the United States \u2014 harking back to ill-fated talks on the controversial Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership a decade ago.\nTalks with Washington fell through in 2016, over concerns in the EU that its market would be flooded with chlorinated chicken; workers\u2019 rights would be undermined; and state health services opened up to American companies.\nResuming the free-trade talks with Washington would be a red line for France and put Paris and Berlin at odds. Still, Merz\u2019s more critical tone toward China, which contrasts with the fealty shown by Scholz and longtime CDU Chancellor Angela Merkel, might bring Berlin closer to the position defended by Paris and the European Commission.\nA closer relationship between the two countries might also help ease their major differences on how to deal with China. France has advocated for a tougher approach, which includes \u201cBuy European\u201d measures in public tenders, but also tariffs on subsidized Chinese imports. Germany, which has closer trade ties with China, has been more cautious, fearing a trade war with Beijing.\nThe divergence between the two peaked when Brussels imposed tariffs on imports of Chinese electric vehicles last fall, delighting France but disappointing Germany, which voted against the measure on concerns that its carmakers would suffer Chinese retaliation.\nSaint-Martin, who hails from President Emmanuel Macron\u2019s liberal party, has already worked on trade as head of Business France, the country\u2019s organization in charge of helping French companies to export and attracting foreign investors.\nUntil a few weeks ago, he was a junior minister in charge of an even harder task: putting together a budget for 2025 that would reduce France\u2019s massive deficit while getting the nod from a fragmented parliament \u2014 the budget was not adopted as Michel Barnier\u2019s government collapsed last month precisely over that file.\nHis comments come amid a wide Franco-German divergence on Europe\u2019s economic agenda and especially on the bloc\u2019s two main trade files: the trade agreement with South American countries of the Mercosur bloc struck in December, and mounting trade tensions with China.\nGermany is one of the top supporters of the Mercosur agreement, seeing it as a golden opportunity to export more goods to a region that is increasingly courted by China. France is the fiercest opponent of a deal that is hated by its farmers, who fear competition from South American imports, but also environmental NGOs and parties across the political spectrum.\n\u201cThe way in which the agreement was signed did not suit us, and the French demands were not taken into account,\u201d Saint-Martin said, referring to a trip in December by European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen and the EU's trade chief Maro\u0161 \u0160ef\u010dovi\u010d to seal the deal in Uruguay just hours after the last French government had collapsed.\n\u201cWe absolutely do not consider that what has been agreed today is valid for us,\u201d he stressed, pointing out he raised the issue in his meeting on Friday with \u0160ef\u010dovi\u010d.\nThe EU, the U.S. and Japan already teamed up in Trump\u2019s first term to counter the competitive threat posed by China.\nThe European Union has clinched a string of pacts after the United States, its top trading partner, flipped into full protectionist mode.\nU.S. president also says he\u2019ll ask NATO allies to raise defense spending to 5 percent of GDP.\nTransatlantic military alliance chief echoes Ukrainian leader Volodymyr Zelenskyy in stinging remarks at the World Economic Forum.",

            "content": "Thousands attempted to block delegates from attending meeting where Alice Weidel was chosen as the AfD\u2019s candidate for chancellor in next month\u2019s election.\nThousands of protesters shouting \u201cNo to Nazis\u201d gathered in the German town of Riesa, where the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) party held a key convention approving co-leader Alice Weidel as candidate for chancellor in next month\u2019s snap election.\nThe meeting, which brought 600-odd delegates together on Saturday, eventually got under way two hours behind schedule after police cleared thousands of protesters mounting blockades in the AfD stronghold town, located in the eastern state of Saxony.\n\n\n\n\nProtest organisers, who said 12,000 people from around the country turned up for the demonstration, said police hit groups of demonstrators and used pepper spray to disperse them.\nMaria Schmidt, spokeswoman for the protest organisers, said: \u201cToday we are protecting the right of people to live in safety without the fear of deportation or being attacked.\n\u201cWe are all making it clear: Riesa is not a peaceful place for fascism,\u201d she said.\nPolice claimed about 8,000 demonstrators had assembled outside the town\u2019s convention centre. By late morning, a spokesman said there was \u201cno serious unrest\u201d but that one road on the way to Riesa remained blocked by protesters.\nAs the congress got under way inside the convention centre, Weidel congratulated her party colleagues for \u201cdefying the left-wing mob\u201d while party co-leader Tino Chrupalla accused the demonstrators of acting like \u201canti-democrats and terrorists\u201d.\nAnalysts say that Weidel \u2013 who was this week endorsed by tech billionaire Elon Musk in\u00a0a livestreamed chat on X \u2013 has no realistic chance of becoming Germany\u2019s leader in the February 23 election.\nWhile polls show the far-right party in second place, attracting the support of about 20 percent of the electorate, other parties have refused to work with it.\nThe two-day AfD meeting will see delegates finalising the party\u2019s election programme, with one proposed amendment committing the party to a policy of \u201cremigration\u201d \u2013 meaning a wide-ranging campaign to expel foreigners from Germany.\nControversy has also been stirred by the party leadership\u2019s plans to replace its Junge Alternative (\u201cYoung Alternative\u201d) youth wing, which has been classified as an extremist group by intelligence services.\nA draft version of the manifesto also includes a pledge to leave the euro and a reversal of Germany\u2019s exit from nuclear power.\nFriedrich Merz, candidate for the mainstream conservative opposition Union bloc that leads polls with about 30 percent, is currently favoured to become the next chancellor.\nThe Union is focusing on boosting Germany\u2019s stagnant economy and reducing irregular migration.\nAt a news conference in Hamburg, Merz focused on bringing \u201cfundamental change\u201d after the unpopular and fractious coalition of centre-left\u00a0Chancellor Olaf Scholz\u00a0collapsed in November.\nScholz\u2019s coalition government\u00a0fell apart after he fired his finance minister in a dispute over how to revitalise the economy, leading to an early election.\nScholz conceded on Saturday that mistakes were made, but said it was time to look to the future.\n\u201cLet\u2019s fight,\u201d he told delegates at a party convention in Berlin, which formally confirmed his nomination as its candidate in a show of hands.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFollow Al Jazeera English:",

Musk made the gesture twice at an inauguration event for President Trump at the beginning of last week.\u00a0A U.K. campaign group and a German satirical group have taken responsibility for the projections.\n\n\nAny display of Nazi symbols is against federal law in Germany.

Musk\u2019s appearance Saturday at the rally for Alternative for Germany, known as AfD, was unadvertised and came by video. It was the second time in as many weeks that the world\u2019s richest man and close ally of new U.S. President Donald Trump has appeared alongside Alice Weidel, the party\u2019s candidate for chancellor in Germany\u2019s Feb. 23 election. During his speech, Musk told a cheering crowd of 4,500 that he believed the AfD was \u201cthe best hope for Germany.\u201d He also alluded to Germany\u2019s history. \u201cThere is too much focus on past guilt, and we need to move beyond that. Children should not be guilty of the sins of their parents, let alone their great-grandparents,\u201d Musk said. He added that he believed the party could \u201cpreserve\u201d and \u201cprotect\u201d German culture, which he implied was facing a threat. \u201cIt\u2019s good to be proud of German culture, German values, and not to lose that in some sort of multiculturalism that dilutes everything,\u201d Musk said. The rally is set to be AfD\u2019s largest before next month\u2019s elections, in which the party is polling in second place. The rally took place in Halle, the eastern Germany city where a far-right extremist attacked a synagogue on Yom Kippur in 2019. Musk\u2019s appearance at the rally comes days after he twice made a straight-armed gesture at a Trump inauguration event that ignited comparisons to the Nazi \u201cSieg Heil\u201d salute. After some arbiters of antisemitism said they would give him the benefit of the doubt, Musk posted a series of Holocaust jokes on X, the social network that he owns. The entire saga followed Musk\u2019s recent endorsement of AfD, which has found increasing traction in Germany with its anti-immigrant, pro-Russia and anti-European Union platform. Some of its politicians have also downplayed the Holocaust, and German courts have fined one of its regional leaders, Bj\u00f6rn H\u00f6cke, multiple times for using the Nazi-era phrase \u201cAlles f\u00fcr Deutschland,\u201d or Everything for Germany. Musk hosted Weidel for a livestream on X earlier this month. During the call, Weidel falsely claimed that Adolf Hitler was a communist in a bid to distance AfD\u2019s politics from the Nazis\u2019. Musk\u2019s appearance at the AfD rally caused at least some Jews who said they had previously given Musk the benefit of the doubt to condemn him. \u201cThere I was. Joining the chorus calling the left ridiculous because of a poorly orchestrated arm gesture. And then this happens, coupled with a few Holocaust zingers on Twitter in terrible taste, and now, I\u2019m not so sure who is ridiculous, or if in fact we are all being played,\u201d Blake Flayton, a pro-Israel influencer, posted on Instagram.\n\nTOPICS: Miscellaneous\nKEYWORDS: adf; afdareleftists; antisemitism; auschwitz; concerntroll; concerntrolling; cryharder; eussr; fourthreich; kkk; mds; musk; muskkk; neonazis; notrightwing; wahhhh\n\n\nNavigation: use the links below to view more comments.\nfirst 1-20,\u00a021-40,\u00a041-58 next last\n\n\n\n    Germans are rightly sensitive to minimizing the legacy of Jew-hating in its history. Throughout the country, even in small towns and villages, memorials to deported and murdered Jews, in the form of stolpersteine, or stumbling stones, provide a jarring reminder of the toll taken by the Hitler regime. Musk's joking minimization of the Nazi past and his cozying up to a party rooted in anti-semitism are despicable. AfD party leaders speak rhapsodically of Vaterland and Volk, buzzwords the Nazis regularly deployed, and have decried the Berlin Holocaust Memorial as a laughable abomination.\n\n1\nposted on 01/27/2025 8:56:14 AM PST\nby Miami Rebel\n\n[\nPost Reply\n | Private Reply\n | View Replies]\n\nTo: Miami Rebel\n\nAnother dishonest \u201cnazi salute\u201d reference.

The entire saga followed Musk\u2019s recent endorsement of AfD, which has found increasing traction in Germany with its anti-immigrant, pro-Russia and anti-European Union platform. Some of its politicians have also downplayed the Holocaust, and German courts have fined one of its regional leaders, Bj\u00f6rn H\u00f6cke, multiple times for using the Nazi-era phrase \u201cAlles f\u00fcr Deutschland,\u201d or Everything for Germany. Musk hosted Weidel for a livestream on X earlier this month. During the call, Weidel falsely claimed that Adolf Hitler was a communist in a bid to distance AfD\u2019s politics from the Nazis\u2019.

Some of its politicians have also downplayed the Holocaust, and German courts have fined one of its regional leaders, Bj\u00f6rn H\u00f6cke, multiple times for using the Nazi-era phrase \u201cAlles f\u00fcr Deutschland,\u201d or Everything for Germany.

Musk\u2019s appearance at the AfD rally caused at least some Jews who said they had previously given Musk the benefit of the doubt to condemn him. \u201cThere I was.

Addressing a hall of 4,500 people alongside party leader Alice Weidel, Musk spoke live via video link about preserving German culture and protecting the German people. \"It's good to be proud of German culture, German values, and not to lose that in some sort of multiculturalism that dilutes everything,\" Musk said. Last week, the U.S. billionaire caused uproar after he made a gesture that drew online comparisons to a Nazi salute during U.S. President Donald Trump's inauguration festivities. On Saturday, he said \"children should not be guilty of the sins of their parents, let alone their great grandparents,\" apparently referring to Germany's Nazi past. \"There is too much focus on past guilt, and we need to move beyond that,\" he said.

The businessman emerged as Trump\u2019s close advisor during the latter\u2019s election campaign last year. \u201cYou have my full support,\u201d he told the rally, adding that the AfD seeks to get \u201cgovernment out of people\u2019s ways\u201d and give \u201cpeople back personal freedom\u201d and protect them from \u201cdangers.\u201d\nThe right-wing party has long been known for its harsh anti-immigrant rhetoric, with many German media outlets referring to it as far-right.

In December, he called it the only party capable of \u201csaving Germany\u201d and praised its anti-immigration stance while calling German Chancellor Olaf Scholz an \u201cincompetent fool.\u201d\nEarlier in January, the businessman also hosted a livestream with Weidel on his social media platform X, reiterating that \u201conly AfD can save Germany.\u201d The livestream was closely monitored by some 150 EU officials and technical specialists as Brussels suspected it could give the right-wing party an \u201cunfair advantage\u201d ahead of the February 23 vote.\nMusk\u2019s activities have provoked unease in Berlin. Scholz had previously accused the SpaceX and Tesla CEO of seeking attention online and urged people to not \u201cfeed the troll.\u201d Later, he also called him a \u201cthreat\u201d to democracy and stated that although people in Germany and Europe enjoy freedom of speech, it cannot be used to support \u201cextreme-right positions.\u201d\nOn Saturday, Musk accused the German government of \u201csuppressing [free] speech very aggressively\u201d and said that \u201ctrue democracy\u201d is impossible under such circumstances.\nRT News App\n\u00a9 Autonomous Nonprofit Organization \u201cTV-Novosti\u201d, 2005\u20132025.

(Reuters: Liesa Johannssen)\nMr Musk has rattled European politicians in recent weeks with comments on his social platform X supporting AfD and far-right politicians in other countries, including Britain.\nHe also drew attention this week for making a public gesture some observers interpreted as a straight-armed Nazi salute, a claim he himself dismissed as a smear.\nLike Mr Trump, the AfD opposes immigration, denies climate change, rails against gender politics and has declared war on a political establishment and mainstream media it claims limit free speech.\nThe anti-AfD rallies took place in some 60 towns following calls from a variety of organisations, attracting more people than the police had initially expected.\nThere is debate about what gesture the tech billionaire meant to make at the Capital arena on Monday. Here's what people are saying.\nThe CDU's Mr Merz also came in for criticism.\nMany protesters fear he is tempted to break his party's policy of refusing to enter into coalition talks with the AfD.\nThere was also a protest in the southern city of Aschaffenbourg, where a deadly knife attack this week by an Afghan migrant further inflamed the debate over immigration.\nSeveral thousand also turned out in the eastern city of Halle, where the AfD rally was addressed by Mr Musk, leading to a few incidents.\nHalle police said they had opened criminal investigations for offences including assault, insults and disrupting traffic.\nMs Weidel told her rally that migrants in Germany had to be sent home.\nAFP/Reuters\nTopic:Air and Space Accidents and Incidents\nLIVE\nTopic:Disasters, Accidents and Emergency Incidents\nTopic:Child Abuse\nTopic:Crime\nTopic:Air and Space Accidents and Incidents\nTopic:Street Art\nTopic:Crime\nCommunity and Society\nGermany\nGovernment and Politics\nUnited States\nWorld Politics\nTopic:Air and Space Accidents and Incidents\nTopic:Air and Space Accidents and Incidents\nTopic:Disasters, Accidents and Emergency Incidents\nTopic:Child Abuse\nTopic:Crime\nAnalysis by Michelle Grattan\nTopic:Art\nTopic:Elections\nTopic:Australian Federal Elections\nWe acknowledge Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples as the First Australians and Traditional Custodians of the lands where we live, learn, and work.\nThis service may include material from Agence France-Presse (AFP), APTN, Reuters, AAP, CNN and the BBC World Service which is copyright and cannot be reproduced.\nAEST = Australian Eastern Standard Time which is 10 hours ahead of GMT (Greenwich Mean Time)",

In a recent virtual speech, he encouraged pride in German culture and criticized multiculturalism. Musk's endorsement has helped the AfD gain visibility, even as the party faces surveillance for extremism and remains isolated in the European Parliament. As Germany approaches national elections, polls suggest the AfD could receive up to 20% of the vote. Musk's involvement raises concerns about his impact on democracy and the perception of far-right politics in Europe.",
            "content": "Elon Musk is flexing his political power, both at home and abroad.\nOn Saturday, Musk spoke virtually at a campaign event for the Alternative for Germany party, or AfD, a far-right political group that is \u2014 among other things \u2014 fiercely anti-immigration.\nIn his live-streamed speech alongside AfD leader Alice Weidel, Musk told about 4,500 AfD supporters they should celebrate German culture.\n\"It's good to be proud of German culture, German values, and not to lose that in some sort of multiculturalism that dilutes everything,\" he said.\nMusk's support for AfD \u2014 which has come primarily in the form of posts on his social media platform, X, but also in newspaper op-eds and speeches \u2014 has helped what was once a fringe political party enter the mainstream, lifting it up in front of a global audience.\nFounded in 2013, the AfD is \"quite extreme even by European far-right standards,\" Kai Arzheimer, a political science professor at Germany's University of Mainz, told Business Insider.\n\"It's a party that's been isolated in the European Parliament,\" he said. \"Even other far-right parties don't want to cooperate with the AfD.\"\nIt wasn't always that way. Arzheimer said AfD was once \"very much an upper-class party,\" popular among those in center-right politics. Within a few years, however, it had tacked to the right over issues like immigration and the role of Islam in Europe.\n\"We had this huge influx of refugees from the Middle East, mostly from Syria, and that accelerated this development of the party,\" Arzheimer said. \"So from around about 2017, they were a national force in politics.\"\nThe Russian invasion of Ukraine, which stoked fears about energy security, helped the party increase its support, Arzheimer said.\n\"What sets them apart from many other radical right parties in Europe is that they are quite open about their relationship with right-wing extremist actors outside the party and even inside the party. So they are on a trajectory that has taken them to the very margins of the political spectrum. Nonetheless, they're quite popular,\" he said.\nThose affiliations have caught the attention of Germany's domestic intelligence agency, which has put the group under surveillance for extremism.\nThe AfD is also nationalist, promoting an anti-European Union agenda.\n\"[The AfD] is characterized by an anti-EU, anti-globalization, and anti-migration platform topped by an uncritical stance with regard to some of the dark chapters of German history,\" Thomas Zittel, a politics professor at Goethe University Frankfurt, told Business Insider. \"What is missing with this party is a constructive and promising economic agenda that would match the anti-regulatory stances that Musk probably wishes to see.\"\n\"I'm very excited for the AfD. I think you're really the best hope for Germany,\" Musk told the crowd on Saturday.\nThe Tesla CEO, who owns a major electric vehicle factory near Berlin, first publicly backed the AfD in a short post on X in December that quickly bounced around the world and upended German politics. Germany is holding national elections in late February.\nThen, in a December op-ed for Welt am Sonntag, a major German newspaper, Musk called the AfD the \"last spark of hope for this country.\"\nWelt am Sonntag and Business Insider are both owned by Axel Springer SE.\nMusk has praised AfD's stances on \"controlled immigration\" and limited government regulation and reposted comments on X accusing Europe and the United States of overusing the label \"far-right.\" He also called German Chancellor Olaf Scholz an \"incompetent fool.\"\nHe has waded into far-right politics in other nations, too. Musk called for UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer to be removed from office and for the release of Tommy Robinson, a jailed British far-right agitator whose real name is Stephen Yaxley-Lennon.\n\"He supports not just the AfD but also more obviously right-wing extremist actors. So for instance, Tommy Robinson in the UK, someone who's incarcerated,\" Arzheimer said. \"Also, many other right-wing extremists became more and more noisy on Twitter, X, whatever you want to call it, and that is seen as something very problematic when we talk about Elon Musk.\"\nMusk has posted on X the MAGA-adjacent phrase, \"Make Europe Great Again,\" one of many comments that have caught the attention of European leaders.\n\"I think you want more self-determination for Germany and for other countries in Europe and less from Brussels,\" Musk said in his speech on Saturday, referencing the European Union headquarters. \"There's too much bureaucracy from Brussels, too much control from a sort of global elite.\"\nRepresentatives for Musk did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\nAs Musk's power and influence grows, so does his impact on democracy, Arzheimer said.\n\"He has this control over social media. He has a lot of money. He has a huge factory in Germany,\" Arzheimer said. \"He has got many other commercial interests, so he's increasingly seen as a political danger to liberal democracy.\"\nThough Musk cited his economic interests in Germany in his op-ed, Arzheimer said it's also possible that this is just his worldview.\n\"Maybe it's all instrumental. Maybe it's all a game to him. Maybe he's on a personal journey. I have no idea. But it's quite systematic,\" he said.\nAfD has gained traction in Germany, and polls now indicate it could receive as much as 20% of the vote on February 23. The party, however, remains isolated. Mainstream German parties have so far refused to join it in any coalition.\nMusk's endorsement may interest young people and business leaders, but it also could further isolate the party.\nMusk, for example, caused a stir in Germany after his speech at Trump's inaugural celebration last week, Arzheimer said. While speaking to a crowd, Musk made what some interpreted as a fascist salute.\nMusk denied a few days later that his gesture was anything but innocent, posting on X: \"It was astonishing how insanely hard legacy media tried to cancel me for saying 'my heart goes out to you' and moving my hand from my heart to the audience.\"\nIn Germany, Arzheimer said a gesture like that could land someone in serious trouble, regardless of their intention.\n\"Of course, that gesture is actually illegal in Germany,\" he said. \"It's not going to happen, but in theory, he could be persecuted for that because it's seen as a symbol of the Nazi rule, and those symbols are outlawed in Germany.\"\n\"He's pushing these ideas. He's bringing back all those extremists to Twitter,\" Arzheimer added. \"I think many people were not surprised in Germany or, in the European context, of him acting like that at the inauguration party.\"\nJump to",

            "content": "Romania is repeating elections after allegations of political interference by Russia via TikTok. Elon Musk has used X to promote German far-right party AfD. Scientists want to know whether any of this affects voters.\nGermany holds snap federal elections on February 23, 2025. For tech billionaire and Trump associate Elon Musk, it is clear who should win the election: the Alternative for Germany (AfD)\u2014 a party that\u00a0is partially classified as right-wing extremist by the German Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution.\nMusk wrote on\u00a0X, the social media platform\u00a0formerly called Twitter, that only the AfD can save Germany. He has also offered the AfD's leader, Alice Weidel, a joint conversation on X, which he owns.\nOn German social media, the AfD is considered the most agile party, especially on TikTok, where their videos are watched by hundreds of thousands of people.\nTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video\nThe algorithms behind social media platforms determine what we see. An algorithm prioritizes content from well-known figures or content that many other users have liked or commented upon. Or it stops showing content altogether if it has been frequently ignored.\nThis can lead\u00a0to a one-sided perspective where one's own worldview is reinforced, and other viewpoints are ignored \u2014 it's what experts call a \"filter bubble\". This can have the effect of strengthening values and beliefs that we have already developed.\nBut according to Judith M\u00f6ller, professor of communication research at the Leibniz Institute for Media Research, media of all kinds have only a very small impact on electoral decisions.\n\"The decision to vote has many different causes. It depends on where and how one grew up, what personal experiences one has had \u2014 especially in the weeks before the election \u2014 or who one talks to about the election and politics.\"\nOn social media, new movements and parties can become visible quickly. But in general, social media mostly reach one's own supporters \u2014 and possibly some undecided individuals.\n\"You can hardly convince people of something new; you can only convince those who are already convinced,\" said\u00a0M\u00f6ller.\nThe handling of misinformation will become even more problematic in the future. Fake news is likely to increase on\u00a0Facebook and Instagram after Meta announced it will stop professionally fact-checking its social media platforms.\nTwo effects could be observed here, said Nicole Kr\u00e4mer, an expert in Social Psychology, Media, and Communication at the University of Duisburg-Essen.\nOn the one hand, surveys show that people do not want to fall for disinformation. \"The more important a\u00a0question is for one's own life, the more skilled people are at searching for information that really helps them. [This means finding] information that is credible and balanced,\" said Kr\u00e4mer.\nBut, on the other hand, if misinformation aligns with what someone already thinks, it's more likely to be believed, \"even if initially one thinks: this can't be true,\" Kr\u00e4mer explains.\nThere is another mechanism at play, says Kr\u00e4mer: \"The more often you hear, read, or see a false piece of news, the more likely it is to stick in your memory.\"\nThis leads to the situation where false information sometimes becomes anchored, despite people trying to avoid it.\nFrom a scientific perspective, it would be wrong to believe that social networks do not influence elections, said Andreas Jungherr, professor of political science and digital transformation at Otto-Friedrich University in Bamberg.\nHowever, it is necessary to look closely at how the campaign was conducted, \"especially when there are suspicions that foreign influence is involved, there are other methods that do not rely on TikTok,\" Jungherr said.\nMessages do not succeed through social networks by default, said M\u00f6ller. But if social media align with issues that concern people and are otherwise ignored, then they can succeed.\nDiscussions on social platforms should not be ignored, but they must be properly contextualized, says Philipp M\u00fcller, an academic advisor at the Institute for Media and Communication Studies at the University of Mannheim.\n\"Social media presents a somewhat distorted reality. Often, ignored positions are overemphasized and may appear larger than they originally were in the general population,\" he said.\nThis is also true for the large progressive movements of recent years, such as the acceptance of different gender identities.\nJungherr sees social media as a kind of stress test for democracy. Digital media make the fault lines of different positions in society more visible. However, they do not accurately reflect these fault lines, he said.\nTherefore, it is crucial to ask: \"Is this truly a societal problem? What is the factual situation? And if it is indeed a problem, can we solve it politically?\"\nIf a society suppresses issues instead of addressing them and placing them in context, Jungherr said, \"[then] democracy misses an opportunity.\"\nThis article was originally published in German.",

Amplified by networks of fake accounts, they have received over 2.8 million views, CeMAS said.\nThe report comes a month ahead of the election which Germany's main opposition conservatives are expected to win. However the strength of the AfD, polling in second place, could make the arithmetic of forming a coalition - and governance in general - more difficult if it can swing a blocking minority.\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEuropean leaders hit back in Elon Musk meddling row\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnger in Germany at Musk attempt to 'influence' opinions on election\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMUSK FACTOR\nIn December the anti-immigration AfD won the endorsement of X owner Elon Musk, who this month also hosted a live chat with the party's chancellor candidate Alice Weidel on his platform.\nA survey published on Saturday by pollster INSA put the conservatives on 29 per cent and the AfD on 21 per cent - twice what it achieved in the 2021 election. Scholz's Social Democrats were trailing in third place on 16 per cent and the Greens on 13 per cent.\nGermany's domestic intelligence agency (BfV) said in November it had set up a task force to head off any foreign state attempts to influence the federal election.\nGermany is Ukraine's second biggest financial and military backer, seeking to help it fend off Russia's full-scale invasion that began nearly three years ago.\nThis has resulted in a sharp rise in \"aggressive behaviour\" by Moscow towards Germany and other Ukraine allies, the BfV said.\nThe US Justice Department said last year that the Russian Doppelganger operation is orchestrated by the Russian government through a group of Russian marketing agencies.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    Source: Reuters/ec\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSign up for our newsletters\nGet our pick of top stories and thought-provoking articles in your inbox\nSubscribe here\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGet the CNA app\nStay updated with notifications for breaking news and our best stories\nDownload here\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGet WhatsApp alerts\nJoin our channel for the top reads for the day on your preferred chat app\nJoin here\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n      Related Topics\n  \n\n      Germany\n  \n\n      Russia\n  \n\n      disinformation\n  \n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n      Also worth reading\n  \n\nContent is loading...\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdvertisement",

            "content": "As Germany prepares for elections in February, concern has grown about the efforts of anti-democratic actors to sway public opinion through online manipulation. Tactics range from cyberattacks to AI propaganda.\nGermany is bracing for digital threats in the run-up to the general election.\nWith the country expected to elect a new parliament on February 23, authorities and researchers are raising concerns about the potential impact of hack-and-leak operations\u00a0and\u00a0disinformation campaigns aimed at swaying public opinion or sowing division ahead of the vote.\nIn a recent analysis, Germany's domestic intelligence agency warned of \"attempts by foreign states to exert influence.\"\nThis warning was echoed by Claudia Plattner, the president of Germany's cybersecurity agency, the Federal Office for Information Security (BSI), who told reporters that \"there are forces inside and outside Germany that have an interest in attacking the election process and disrupting the democratic order.\"\nThe snap election, held under a compressed timeline, not only poses logistical challenges for authorities \u2014 it also comes at a time of heightened political tensions.\n\"There are various issues, from the economy to the geopolitical situation, that are dividing society,\" Josef Lentsch, the CEO of the Political Tech Summit conference, which will take place in Berlin at the end of January, told DW.\n\"Populists and extremists are particularly good at exploiting these social divides,\" he said.\nCyberattacks on prominent individuals and organizations may pose a significant threat to the election, experts say. Once obtained, sensitive data can be used in coordinated \"hack-and-leak\" operations, in which stolen material \u2014 often altered or taken out of context \u2014 is released to undermine the credibility of political candidates or parties.\n\"Against the backdrop of the Russian war of aggression against Ukraine, Russia probably has the greatest and most obvious interest in influencing the election in its own favor,\" Germany's domestic\u00a0intelligence agency, the Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution\u00a0(BfV), warned in late November.\nBut domestic actors operating from within Germany pose an equally significant risk to the integrity of the election, Lentsch said.\nTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video\n\"The public sphere has evolved,\" he said. \"Anti-democratic actors are now using channels on messaging platforms like WhatsApp and Telegram, as well as social media platforms like TikTok, to circumvent the filtering functions of traditional media and other trusted entities.\"\nBoth extremist fringe actors and parties such as the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) have spent years building this \"alternative digital infrastructure,\" Lentsch said. \"As a result, they now have almost a decade's head start over other actors, such as the established parties.\"\n\nThe political firepower of this kind of\u00a0digital infrastructure was demonstrated in the first round of Romania's presidential election, with the surprise victory of nationalist Calin Georgescu, a far-right admirer of Russian President Vladimir Putin.\nOn Friday, December 6, Romania's Constitutional Court annulled the results after President Klaus Iohannis had declassified security documents. The documents alleged\u00a0that Russia had run a campaign involving thousands of social media accounts on platforms such as TikTok and Telegram to promote Georgescu.\n\"Romania is an EU country. What happened there can happen elsewhere, including in Germany,\" Lentsch said.\nIn Germany, no\u00a0party has built a larger \"digital infrastructure\" to push its narratives than the AfD, Katja Munoz, a research fellow at the Center for Geopolitics, Geoeconomics and Technology at the Berlin-based think tank German Council on Foreign Relations, told DW.\nWithin this network, multiple social media accounts interact with each other to prompt the platforms' algorithms to amplify the reach of posts, Munoz said: \"It's an orchestrated move to push the same narrative.\"\nAt the same time, new so-called generative AI programs allow parties and individuals to create posts \u2014 from text to images and even video \u2014 much faster than before.\u00a0Officials from across the political spectrum have begun using the technology to create illustrations for social media posts, for example.\nAnd yet \"in Germany, we see that the party that spreads by far the most AI-generated content is the AfD,\" Munoz said, referring to an analysis she conducted\u00a0around the European elections, as well as regional elections in 2024.\n\"This content is not necessarily false, but it's misleading and meant to confirm existing beliefs \u2014 it's AI propaganda,\" she said, citing the example of a 78-second AI-generated video released by the AfD in September, just days before a regional election. The clip depicted scenarios in which people who were mostly blond and blue-eyed were contrasted with people of color, who were shown in negative contexts.\nA multipronged approach is needed to protect the integrity of Germany's campaign and election, experts say.\nTo counter cyberattacks, the BfV has formed a special task force to monitor threats. The cybersecurity agency BSI is offering online seminars to candidates and parties to help them secure their devices and online accounts against cyber intruders.\n\"Normally we would have liked to do this on site and in person, but now we have to switch to webinars simply because we don't have as much time to prepare as we thought,\" BSI President Plattner told the public broadcaster\u00a0Deutschlandradio.\nWith only about two and a half months remaining until the expected elections, Lentsch said: \"It is all the more important that civil society, political actors and state authorities engage in dialogue, especially as the period leading up to the elections has shortened.\"\nMunoz said authorities should also step up efforts to raise awareness about disinformation and AI-generated propaganda: \"Officials should explain to people how public opinion is being manipulated and how fringe views are being pushed to the center of the debate.\"\nEdited by: Rina Goldenberg\nWhile you're here: Every Tuesday, DW editors round up what is happening in German politics and society.

            "summary": "The upcoming federal election in Germany on February 23 raises concerns about the role of social media in political campaigns, especially with the rise of populist parties like the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD). Experts highlight the effectiveness of platforms like TikTok in engaging first-time voters and note a trend of polarization, as extremist parties thrive on social media. The influence of foreign disinformation, particularly from Russia, poses additional challenges. While traditional parties struggle with disinformation and personal attacks, there is a call for them to engage more actively on social media to counteract these trends.",
            "content": "After Donald Trump's US election win and with an early federal election slated to take place in Germany on February 23, questions are being asked about what role social media could \u2014 and should \u2014 play in party campaigns.\nThe leaders of Germany's traditional parties are clearly nervous about the rise of populist parties.\nThe far-right\u00a0Alternative for Germany (AfD) secured just over 30% of the vote in recent state\u00a0elections in Thuringia and Saxony, which was partly\u00a0attributed to the party's effectiveness at reaching first-time voters on TikTok.\nMatthias Kettemann, an expert on internet regulation and media law at the University of Innsbruck in Austria, argues that it its impossible to say exactly what impact social media has in shaping public opinion and democratic decision-making processes more broadly.\nHowever, what is clear is that more and more people are using social media and that there is a general trend toward\u00a0polarization. \"The parties on the far right and far left tend to do much better on social media because they tend to have easier stories to tell, which in turn foster engagement together with the amplification algorithms of the platforms,\" Kettemann told DW.\nObservers are also wary of the growing influence of Elon Musk, the world's wealthiest man and CEO of the platform X, who was arguably Trump's greatest ally in his successful campaign to retake the US presidency.\nAfter Germany's ruling coalition government collapsed on November 6, Musk repeatedly referred to Germany's center-left leaders as \"fools.\"\nMeanwhile, Vice Chancellor and Economy Minister Robert Habeck, of Germany's\u00a0Green Party, this week\u00a0made a surprise comeback to the microblogging platform following a six-year break, saying he did not think it was right to leave X to the \"loudmouths and populists.\"\n\"The most important problem is disinformation from the top,\" said J\u00f6rg Hassler, an expert in digital and political communication at Ludwig Maximilian University in Munich. He said\u00a0political leaders now focus more on making personal attacks on their competitors or engage in\u00a0debates on side issues like election dates.\nDuring a debate in the Bundestag on Wednesday, center-right Christian Democrat (CDU) leader Friedrich Merz expressed his disgust at AI-generated fake videos about him that had been circulating online and shared on social media. \"The fact that they are being posted and forwarded by Social Democrat lawmakers gives a taste of the kind of election campaign you are obviously prepared to run here in Germany,\" Merz said.\n\"The important issues are how well the economy does, whether people are able to get state welfare and so on, but it appears that politicians aren't interested in talking about those,\" said Kettemann.\nTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video\nWhile campaign tools developed in the US are subject to strict legal and regulatory limits in Germany, for example through data protection laws\u00a0and laws around party financing, social media\u00a0has become an important part of the hybrid media ecosystem, in which information loops between social media and traditional\u00a0media outlets.\n\"You can't win elections on social media, but you can lose them,\" said Hassler. He pointed\u00a0to the example of Armin Laschet, who ran as the CDU\u00a0candidate for chancellor in the 2021 federal election. Laschet's campaign was effectively sunk after he was filmed laughing during a official visit to Rhein-Erft-Kreis, a region of Germany devastated by extreme flooding in July 2021. Outrage spread on X, then called Twitter, using the hashtag \"#laschetlacht\" (\"#laschetlaughs\").\nFor the first time in 2022, more German citizens said they mainly followed the news online rather than on television, as reported in the Reuters Institute annual survey for the Study of Journalism. According to the 2024 Media Study by German public broadcasters ARD and ZDF, only 7% of the German population uses X on a regular basis compared with Instagram (37%),\u00a0Facebook (33%) and TikTok (18%).\nAnother important factor in the upcoming federal election, said Kettemann says, will be the role of foreign actors using disinformation operations, for example bot farms and \"dark campaigns\" on messaging apps such as Telegram and WhatsApp to push certain narratives. Germany's populist AfD and the\u00a0\u00a0leftist Sahra Wagenknecht Alliance (BSW)have run on pro-Russia, socially conservative, anti-immigration and anti-climate protection platforms.\n\"We know for example that Russia much prefers certain political parties in Germany over others. They want to exacerbate the polarization tendencies within German society and that's a threat we should be keenly aware of in the run-up to the Bundestag election,\" said Hassler.\nTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video\nThe EU has already introduced a comprehensive set of regulations for social media and digital marketplaces with the Digital Services Act (DSA) that aims to prevent illegal and harmful activities online, as well as the spread of disinformation.\nIn preliminary findings issued\u00a0in July,\u00a0EU regulators found X to be in breach of the DSA, stating that the blue check verification system \"deceives users,\" that the platform was not in compliance with \"required transparency on advertising\" and \"fails to provide access to its public data to researchers.\"\nThe challenge now will be to implement the legislation, said Kettemann, and that won't happen in time for the German federal election\u00a0in February anyway. \"Some platforms like X don't seem to be cooperating whatsoever with the EU rules, so it will be quite challenging to bring that platform in line with democratic values and EU rules,\" he said.\nThis could be even more difficult in future because Musk's role is growing in US policy-making, Kettemann said, after US Vice President-elect JD Vance suggested this week that the US would withdraw support for NATO if the EU tried\u00a0to regulate\u00a0X.\nAs more and more voters, especially young voters, are informing themselves about politics and world affairs on social media, Ketterman urged\u00a0traditional parties to step up their activities on social media platforms\u00a0because they should not leave the field to disinformation actors.\n\"We have to fight the fight,\" he said.\nEdited by: Rina Goldenberg\nWhile you're here: Every Tuesday, DW editors round up what is happening in German politics and society.

Chancellor Olaf Scholz's SPD and the Greens are struggling to agree on funding sources without cutting social programs. The opposition supports aid but opposes new debt. With the elections approaching, the likelihood of passing the aid package before the vote appears low.",
            "content": "German military aid for Ukraine is stalling ahead of the Bundestag elections. A dispute within the government is preventing further funds from being released for weapons.\nFor Germany's Green Party, the landscape is clear: A further aid package for Ukraine could be passed before the parliamentary election on February 23 \u2013 even though a budget for 2025 has not yet been approved. The package would include \u20ac3 billion ($3.1 billion) worth of weapons, primarily for Ukraine's air defense.\nIn fact, delivering weapons is not what is being disputed in Germany's current minority government, a coalition of Chancellor Olaf Scholz's Social Democratic Party (SPD) and the Greens, but rather its financing and timing.\nFollowing the breakup of the \"traffic light\" coalition last year, the German parliament was unable to pass a federal budget for 2025. \"The 2025 budget is not there, so the question of where the money should come from is justified,\" said Economy Minister Robert Habeck, who is also the Green Party's chancellor candidate.\nHabeck believes there is still a chance to make the funds available.\u00a0The Bundestag's budget committee could make a decision to take on more debt. The aid package for Ukraine could then be passed before the election. \"It has been proven often enough that Putin exploits weakness. That is why permanent financing is necessary,\" Habeck emphasized.\nThe Greens say that Scholz is blocking the new aid package. The chancellor, however, does not want to be accused of not providing Ukraine with sufficient support.\u00a0\"As everyone knows, Germany is Ukraine's biggest supporter and will remain so \u2014 so that the country can defend its independence and sovereignty,\" he said this week at the NATO summit of the Nordic countries in Helsinki.\nTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video\nThere may be some electioneering going on here.\u00a0Scholz is also currently fighting for votes as the SPD's leading candidate for the upcoming election, and the SPD's members and party supporters are growing war-weary.\u00a0The willingness to continue spending billions on arms deliveries is waning, given Germany's economic problems and tight budget.\nThat is why Scholz is currently portraying himself as a \"peace chancellor.\" At a recent SPD conference in Berlin, he emphasized the need for \"real negotiations that finally put an end to the death and destruction in Ukraine.\" He said Germans could rely on him to remain \"sober-minded.\" He promised\u00a0he would ensure that \"we are not dragged into this war,\" despite his support for Ukraine\u00a0and repeatedly emphasized that that support would not come at the expense of German citizens.\nThere is, however, a lack of funds in the public coffers for further arms deliveries. At a\u00a0campaign event in Bielefeld on Monday, Scholz emphasized, \"I'm against us taking this from pensions, I'm against us doing this through cuts to local authorities, I'm against us investing less money in railroads and roads.\"\nOne of the next government's first tasks will be to create a budget for the current year\u00a0and Scholz insists that any calls for new weapons funding must \"also say where the money will come from.\"\nGreen politicians\u00a0like Bundestag member Anton Hofreiter\u00a0believe that any government policy that ties a \u20ac3 billion Ukrainian aid package to social spending cuts in Germany would be a cop-out.\nFurther aid for Ukraine would not only serve the Greens' interests, but also those of Defense Minister Boris Pistorius, who is intent on showing Germany's support for Ukraine. The SPD politician traveled to Kyiv on Tuesday for an unannounced visit, where he stressed that Germany would continue to stand by Ukraine.\nWith only one week to go until Donald Trump is\u00a0inaugurated as US president, Pistorius' visit was also designed to send yet another signal of support. Kyiv fears that Trump might drastically reduce US aid, which may mean that European countries are forced to increase their support fast.\nThe German opposition, which includes the\u00a0Christian Democratic Union (CDU), the\u00a0Christian Socialist Union (CSU)\u00a0and now also the Free Democratic Party (FDP), is\u00a0not against a new military aid package per se \u2014 it's\u00a0against taking on any additional debt. The parties\u00a0are therefore proposing parallel spending cuts, for instance, to Germany's unemployment benefits.\nThe SPD rejects such a proposal. With this impasse, it appears highly unlikely that a new aid package for Ukraine will be passed before the impending Bundestag elections.\nThis article was translated from German.\nWhile you're here: Every Tuesday, DW editors round up what is happening in German politics and society.

At the same time, insiders from his SPD party told Spiegel the chancellor could be avoiding any new arms deliveries during the election campaign, fearing it might alienate voters.\nThe wrangling over the aid package follows the collapse of Germany\u2019s traffic light coalition in November due to a number of disputes, including on Ukraine aid. A snap election is scheduled for February 23.\nGermany has been a key supporter of Kiev since the start of the conflict, pledging around \u20ac28 billion in total assistance. However, Germany slashed its military aid to Ukraine in 2025 to \u20ac4 billion, down from \u20ac7.5 billion the previous year. Scholz has also been reluctant to approve deliveries of Taurus long-range missiles, arguing that it could escalate hostilities and make Germany a direct participant.\nRussia, meanwhile, has repeatedly denounced Western arms shipments to Ukraine, claiming they prolong the conflict without changing its ultimate outcome.\nRT News App\n\u00a9 Autonomous Nonprofit Organization \u201cTV-Novosti\u201d, 2005\u20132025.

Leaders from China, Ukraine and Germany have taken the stage on day one.\nThis blog is now closed, thanks for following along.\nGerman opposition leader Friedrich Merz, the current front-runner in the race to become the country's next chancellor, voiced clear optimism about the prospect of working with US President Donald Trump while speaking in Davos.\n\"I think he will be an interesting partner for us [Europeans], said Merz. \"He's a dealmaker, so let's think about what we can offer.\"\nThough the conservative made no mention of what exactly could be offered, he suggested European nations import US liquefied natural gas and focused on purchasing US arms. \"If we have to take military equipment from the US, why don't we combine our purchases on the European level?\"\nMerz also reiterated his observation that Trump is a \"predictable\" politician before saying, \"let's work with him and let's figure out where we are having approaches in common.\"\nThe interim Foreign Minister of Syria, Asaad Shaibani, said he would be participating in the World Economic Forum.\n\"I will be honoured to represent Syria for the first time in its history at the World Economic Forum in Switzerland,\" al-Shaibani wrote in a post on X.\nShaibani said that he will convey the vision of the new Syrian administration regarding the future of Syria and the aspirations of the Syrian people when he takes part in the forum.\nSyria\u2019s new leadership has been trying to establish new diplomatic relations since the ousting of long-time ruler Bashar Assad.\nDe facto leader, Ahmed al-Sharaa,\u00a0led the surprise rebel advance that toppled Assad's regime in December 2024.\nAssad and his family fled to Moscow after more than two decades in power.\nSouth Africa\u2019s President Cyril Ramaphosa began his address by highlighting that the G20 summit will be hosted in Johannesburg later this year.\nThis would be the first time the gathering will be held on the African continent.\nRamaphosa spoke of cooperation being a key marker in human development and said it was the \"bedrock of human civilization.\"\nThe South African president said it was time to harness \"mutually beneficial cooperation and collaboration.\"\n\"This I believe is a time of rising geopolitical tensions, unilateralism, nationalism, protectionism and isolation,\"\u00a0Ramaphosa said.\nRamaphosa spoke about the decline of \"a sense of common purpose,\"\u00a0but said that \"this is a moment we should be standing together as a global community to resolve the problems that confront humanity.\"\nThe South African leader also said it was also time to harness \"the abundant resources we collectively possess and the remarkable technologies that human ingenuity has produced to overcome poverty, to overcome inequality, unemployment and especially youth unemployment and the abuse of women once and for all.\"\nUkrainian\u00a0President Volodymyr Zelenskyy spoke about the future of Europe and said that a key question that needed asking was, while all eyes were on what was happening in Washington, who was watching Europe at the moment?\nZelenskyy said that \"20 hours ago, President Trump's inauguration took place in Washington and now everyone is waiting to see what he will do next.\"\n\"His first executive orders have already shown clear priorities,\"\u00a0Zelenskyy said, and added: \"Most of the world's thinking, what is going to happen to their relationship with America.\"\n\"What will happen to alliances, to support, to trade? How does President Trump plan to end wars?\" Zelenskyy asked.\n\"But no one is asking these kinds of questions about Europe. And we need to be honest about that. When we in Europe look at the United States as our ally, it's clear they are an indispensable ally,\"\u00a0Zelenskyy said.\n\"In times of war, everyone worries, will the United States stay with them. And every ally worries about that but does anyone in the United States worry that Europe might abandon them someday?\"\u00a0Zelenskyy asked. \"The answer is no.\"\nZelenskyy asked whether the new administration would even notice Europe. \"Does he see NATO as necessary?\"\nGerman Chancellor Olaf Scholz has expressed a level of cautious optimism when it came to German-US relations a day after US President Donald Trump took his oath of office.\n\"The United States is our closest ally outside Europe. And I will do everything in my power to ensure that it stays that way,\" Scholz said as he addressed the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland.\n\"My first good conversations with President Trump and also the contacts between our advisers point in this direction,\" he added.\nScholz said that the Trump administration\u00a0would keep the world on its toes when it came to climate, trade, foreign and security policies but added that \"We can and will deal with all of this.\"\nWith reference to Trump wanting to put \"America First,\"\u00a0Scholz said that there was nothing wrong with wanting to have your country's interests at heart but stressed that cooperation and understanding were also in a country's best interests.\nScholz also called for cool heads to prevail and that there should also be no\u00a0attempts at \"ingratiation\" or \"sweet talking\" the newly inaugurated President Trump.\n\"Not every press conference in Washington, not every tweet should immediately plunge us into heated, existential debates. This also\napplies after the change of government that took place in Washington yesterday,\" said Scholz.\nChina is looking to import more competitive and high-quality products and is not pursuing a trade surplus, according to China's vice premier, Ding Xuexiang.\n\"Protectionism leads to nowhere, and there are no winners in a trade war,\" Ding said in Davos, calling multilateralism \"the right path for maintaining world peace and promoting human development.\"\nDing's comments come amid concern newly inaugurated US President Donald Trump will make true on his pledges to hike tariffs, something he held off on during his first day back in the White House.\nOn the question of the possibility of reduced US engagement on Ukraine, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said the starting point of the conflict should not be forgotten.\n\"Ukraine is a sovereign country and Ukraine determined its own future by asking for accession to the European Union. That's where it all started. And the response was an invasion by its neighbor Russia,\"\u00a0von der Leyen said.\nTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video\nThe EU chief emphasized that this wasn't only about the security of Ukraine but also European security.\n\"No one wants more peace, than the people of Ukraine, but what they want is a just and a lasting peace,\"\u00a0von der Leyen said.\nUkraine was working hard on its accession ambition while trying to fend off an invasion, von der Leyen said.\n\"So for us, because of all of this, it is very clear that we will continue to support Ukraine,\"\u00a0she added.\n\"Whatever happens next, for us it's important that Ukraine stays an independent country and that it is Ukraine that decides on its own territory.\"\n\"We stand by Ukraine for as long as it takes,\"\u00a0von der Leyen said.\nEuropean Commission President Ursula von der Leyen spoke of the need to \"engage constructively\"\u00a0with China amid a trade spat between Beijing and Brussels.\n\"2025 marks 50 years of our Union's diplomatic relations with China. I see it as an opportunity to engage and deepen our relationship with China, and where possible, even to expand our trade and investment ties,\" von der Leyen said on stage in Davos.\nThe EU chief also said that her top team would visit India to boost ties on the first trip abroad of its new mandate.\n\"Together with Prime Minister (Narendra) Modi we want to upgrade the strategic partnership with the largest country and democracy in the world,\" von der Leyen said.\nEuropean Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said the EU's first priority would be to \"engage early\" and \"stand ready to negotiate\" with US President Donald Trump.\n\"We will be pragmatic, but we will always stand by our principles,\" von der Leyen said in her\u00a0opening address at the gathering of the world's elites in Switzerland.\nThe EU chief said the United States remained an important partner for Europe and struck a conciliatory tone in her speech.\nTrump returned to the White House on Monday, and has prompted concerns he will deliver on promises to slap heavy tariffs on China and US allies, including Canada and the European Union.\nEuropean Commission President Ursula von der Leyen began her remarks in Davos by looking back over the past 25 years at the promise that the dot com boom held with a more connected world.\nThe EU chief said that it was these interconnectors that bring the world together like undersea data cables that\u00a0\"have become targets,\u00a0from the Baltic Sea to the Taiwan Strait.\"\nVon der Leyen spoke of the weaponization of supply chain dependencies \"as shown by Russia's energy blackmail\" that are\u00a0\"exposed as brittle when global shocks such as the pandemic emerge without warning.\"\n\"The cooperative world order we imagined 25 years ago has not turned into reality. Instead, we have entered a new era of harsh geo-strategic competition,\"\u00a0von der Leyen said.\n\"The world's major economies are vying for access to raw materials, new technologies and global trade routes.\"\nVon der Leyen said that it was likely that tariffs, export controls and sanctions would be more frequently used and went on to say that the world would need to work together \"to avoid a race to the bottom.\"\nClose to 3,000 leaders from more than\u00a0130 countries are expected at this year's annual meeting, which is taking place under the theme \"Collaboration in the intelligent age.\"\nThere will be 350 governmental leaders, including 50 heads of state\u00a0and government attending.\nMore than 1,600 business leaders, including some\u00a0900 of the world's top CEOs are expected, along with more than 170 leaders from civil society and social sectors.\n\"Davos is unique in bringing together close to 3,000 decision makers from governments, business, and civil society at the beginning of the year to address the challenges of a world in deep transformation,\"\u00a0said Klaus Schwab, Founder and Chairman of the Board of Trustees in the buildup to today.\n\"Despite divergent positions and great uncertainties, the Annual Meeting 2025 will foster a spirit of cooperation and constructive optimism with the objective of shaping the forthcoming Intelligent Age in a more sustainable and inclusive way.\"\nThe World Economic Forum opens on Tuesday just hours after the inauguration of US President Donald Trump.\nGlobal business and political leaders are meeting at the Swiss resort town of Davos as the world continues to grapple with a series of crises, among them, the continued war in Ukraine and the Israel-Hamas war.\nTrump has already signed a raft of executive orders following a fiery inauguration address in which he vowed to \"put America first.\"\nHis return to the White House will almost certainly bring with it heavy tariffs on China and possibly allies too, in the form of Canada and the European Union, should he stay true to his promise to\u00a0\"tariff and tax foreign countries.\"\nEuropean Commission President Ursula von der Leyen will get proceedings in Davos underway and hinted at the tone to be expected at this year's talks.\n\"I came to Davos to meet leaders, tackle global challenges and forge new partnerships. In an era of growing divides, the Davos spirit offers opportunities to innovate and enhance our prosperity. In this spirit, we need to work together to avoid a global race to the bottom,\" von der Leyen said in a post on X.\nGerman Chancellor Olaf Scholz is expected to make an address later today, followed by\u00a0Ukraine's president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy.\nkb/nm (dpa, AFP, AP, Reuters)",

Scholz's office, however, is blocking the plan, the newspaper said.\nIt added that the foreign and defense ministries intend to ask the German parliament's budget committee for additional funds because the planned budget does not include money for Kiev's urgent needs and because of the uncertainty surrounding the incoming US administration's Ukraine policy.\nScholz's cabinet, in turn, explains its veto of the plan with the unwillingness to present the government that will be formed after the elections with an already decided fact, the newspaper said.\nAnother possible motive behind the Chancellor's stance could be the fear of scaring the SDP voters with another expensive aid package.\nIn late December, German President Frank-Walter Steinmeier said he had decided to dissolve the Bundestag and call early elections for February 23.\nScholz suggested Steinmeier dissolve parliament after a majority of lawmakers supported a no-confidence vote in his government on Dec. 16.

It sought to provide Ukraine with critical weapons systems, including three additional Iris-T air defense batteries, 10 howitzers and more artillery ammunition.\nAccording to the report, the aid package was developed immediately following the collapse of the coalition government in November, with Baerbock and Pistorius aiming to secure parliamentary approval for the funding before February's snap federal elections.\nTheir ministries had justified the request by citing Ukraine's deteriorating military situation, compounded by doubts over continued U.S. support following Donald Trump\u2019s election victory. Baerbock and Pistorius framed the proposal as a vital signal of Germany\u2019s unwavering support.\nDespite their efforts, Scholz remained opposed. The incumbent chancellor reportedly argued that existing military aid allocations \u2014 \u20ac4 billion for 2025, alongside funds from a $50 billion G7 loan financed by frozen Russian assets \u2014 are sufficient. He expressed concern over committing the incoming government to major financial obligations after the election.\nPOLITICO has contacted a chancellery spokesperson for comment on the story.\nPolitical considerations also loom large. The SPD leader is said to fear alienating voters with additional arms deliveries amid a contentious election campaign season. By contrast, the Greens have sought to leverage their support for increased defense spending as an electoral asset.\nDespite the blockade, Pistorius reaffirmed Germany\u2019s broader commitments during the Ukraine Defense Contact Group meeting at the U.S. Air Base in Ramstein on Thursday.

And that\u2019s the main reason why I decided last November to end the government,\u201d Scholz said, adding that voters will now have to decide how to finance further support for Ukraine.\nCriticism of Scholz\u2019s approach has not only come from the conservative opposition.\nForeign Minister Annalena Baerbock from the Greens, one of the parties in the governing coalition, indirectly reproached Scholz for not providing Ukraine with \u20ac3 billion in additional support before the Feb. 23 election. That measure was proposed both by her ministry and by Defense Minister Boris Pistorius, a senior member of Scholz\u2019s party.\n\u201cGermany as a whole isn\u2019t currently seen as a driving force for peace policy in Europe, and honestly, that pains me,\u201d Baerbock told Politico.\nWithout naming Scholz personally, she added: \u201cEven now, during the election campaign, some prioritize a national perspective \u2014 or how to quickly gain a few votes in the parliamentary election \u2014 rather than taking real responsibility for securing Europe\u2019s peace and freedom.\u201d\n\u201cFor me, responsible politics means not zigzagging and then perhaps changing position during election campaigns,\u201d Baerbock said.\nThe chancellor has previously insisted that additional military and economic aid to Ukraine must be financed through new borrowing and not via cuts in social spending or in investment in the green energy transition.\nScholz\u2019s government earmarked \u20ac4 billion for Ukraine in its 2025 budget, and noted that additional funds are available in the form of profits from frozen Russian assets.\nMoreover, not all of Germany\u2019s support is accounted for in its annual budget. Germany also provides indirect funding via the European Union, as it shoulders the largest share of the bloc\u2019s budget, which includes aid to Ukraine.\nScholz also expressed confidence that US President-elect Donald Trump would not abruptly end American support for Ukraine, referencing recent phone calls with Trump as well as conversations between aides.\nPostmedia is committed to maintaining a lively but civil forum for discussion.

I'm against investing less money in roads,\" the chancellor said.\nHe argued that the collapse of the \"traffic light\" coalition \u2013 named for the three parties' official colours of red, yellow and green \u2013 meant there remained a budget gap, as well as failure to pass a 2025 national budget.\n'Extortion'\nLindner characterised Scholz's \"manoeuvre\" on raising the debt ceiling as \"extortion.\" That he's now holding-up the aid shows that the chancellor's priorities do not lie with Ukraine, Lindner told Mediengruppe Bayern.\nThe Greens aren't happy either. \"Why the chancellery has now completely changed its mind and suddenly no longer sees a need, is beyond the comprehension of anyone with a sense of reason,\" said Green lawmaker Agnieskza Burgger.\nIt's been almost three years since Scholz promised to give his country's atrophied defence forces a massive shot in the arm, at the same time as providing substantial military aid to Ukraine's defensive war against the Russian invasion. At the time, he proclaimed a \"Zeitenwende,\" a 'turning point.'\nThe German rearmament that started with a \u20ac100 billion fund has withered so much that it would take the country up to a century to restore the military stockpiles it had 20 years ago, according to the Kiel Institute, a think tank.\nIn the meantime, the government prevaricated over whether it would be a step too far to send helmets to the Ukrainian armed forces.\nSahra Wagenknecht applies pressure\nOne reason for Scholz's dithering could be electoral pressure in eastern Germany from the from Bundnis Sahra Wagenknecht (BSW), a new left-wing party that could drain votes from traditional SPD supporters who are suspicious of German rearmament.\nBSW's eponymous and charismatic leader broke away from the radical party Die Linke (The Left) because of its laissez-faire approach to immigration. Sahra Wagenknecht grew up in the communist German Democratic Republic (GDR) and has spoken nostalgically about the old East German regime. Die Linke itself emerged from the wreckage of the old Socialist Unity Party that controlled the GDR.\nLikewise, the CDU risks losing votes to the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD), which wants friendlier relations with Russia, including the reinstatement of the controversial Nord Stream pipeline that until recently served Germany with Russian gas. Polls currently place the AfD second behind the CDU.\nNo blockage, promises Pistorius\nFor now, Germany remains Ukraine\u2019s biggest military supporter in Europe. But Scholz\u2019s see-sawing between full-throated support and denying what Kyiv asks for has often disappointed Kyiv.\n\"Any additional contribution\u201d would be \u201cwelcome,\u201d Ukraine's foreign minister, Andrij Sybiha, told German public broadcaster ARD on Monday.\nUkraine is under intense pressure from daily Russian attacks with hundreds of drones and dozens of missiles. Sybiha says the additional funds could be used to \u201ccreate an air defence umbrella over Ukraine\u201d.\nGerman Defence Minister Boris\u00a0Pistorius, who arrived for talks in Kyiv on Tuesday, rushed to defend Scholz.\nThere was no blockage, merely a \u201cpolitical decision\u201d to make, he said.\n\"We have prepared a new aid package for Ukraine in the ministry of defence,\" Pistorius said. \"As soon as all issues have been clarified, I expect a corresponding decision to be made.\"\n[Edited by mhk]\nLanguages: Fran\u00e7ais | Spanish 2025Print Email Reddit Facebook  LinkedIn WhatsApp Telegram\nPrint Email Reddit Facebook  LinkedIn WhatsApp Telegram\nEU ministers mull new German plan to reinforce asylum rules\nLead MEPs\u2019 pitch for climate tracking group stalls\nOperation SHIELD seizes drugs worth more than \u20ac11 million\nMEPs grill Commissioners on Mercosur money pots\n\u2018No control\u2019: Sweden grapples with bomb violence wave\nECB further cuts interest rates amid Trump tariff fears\nNorway\u2019s governing coalition breaks over EU energy rules row\nMutual defence applies in space, says Kallas\nEurozone unexpectedly stagnates as German, French economies contract\nEIB to up defence investment to \u20ac2bn this year\nEU ministers mull new German plan to reinforce asylum rules\n30/01/2025\n3 min. read\n\u2018No control\u2019: Sweden grapples with bomb violence wave\n30/01/2025\n2 min. read\nNorway\u2019s governing coalition breaks over EU energy rules row\n30/01/2025\n2 min. read\nEU ministers mull new German plan to reinforce asylum rules\n30/01/2025\n3 min. read\nEU ministers meet in Warsaw for migration, defence and security talks\n30/01/2025\n4 min. read\nGerman lawmakers shout \u201cshame on you\u201d as \u2018firewall\u2019 crumbles\n29/01/2025\n3 min. read",

Der Spiegel reported last week that the chancellor deemed it unnecessary, believing that Kiev still had sufficient funds available from Berlin\u2019s earlier contributions. Scholz also reportedly did not want to alienate voters ahead of the snap vote.\nOn Friday, Baerbock sharply criticized what she called chasing the voters at the expense of vital commitments. \u201cSome prioritize a national perspective \u2013 or how to quickly gain a few votes in the parliamentary election \u2013 rather than taking real responsibility for securing Europe\u2019s peace and freedom,\u201d she told Politico, without calling out Scholz or any other German politician by name.\nThe minister claimed a lack of support for Kiev has led to a situation where \u201cGermany as a whole isn\u2019t\u2026 seen as a driving force for peace policy in Europe.\u201d Such a development \u201cpains\u201d her, Baerbock said, adding that \u201ctrust must not be damaged again by hesitation\u201d that could make other nations feel \u201cGermany won\u2019t stand by them.\u201d\nBaerbock, whose Greens Party is currently fourth in the polls at 14%, also advocated a defense spending increase, echoing earlier statements by her fellow party member, Economy Minister Robert Habeck. Habeck\u2019s proposal to raise defense spending to 3.5% of GDP was criticized by Scholz, who called it a half-baked initiative that would just end up being an additional burden for taxpayers.\nBerlin\u2019s current defense spending stands at just over 2% of GDP. Germany is also one of the biggest military aid donors to Kiev, second only to the US, having allocated around \u20ac11 billion between January 2022 and October 2024 according to the Kiel Institute for the World Economy.\nThe German government slashed military aid to Ukraine in 2025 to \u20ac4 billion, down from \u20ac7.5 billion the previous year. The chancellor has also been reluctant to approve deliveries of Taurus long-range missiles, arguing that it could escalate hostilities and make Germany a direct participant in the conflict.\nRT News App\n\u00a9 Autonomous Nonprofit Organization \u201cTV-Novosti\u201d, 2005\u20132025.

            "content": "\u201cGermany as a whole isn\u2019t currently seen as a driving force for peace policy in Europe, and honestly that pains me,\u201d Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock told POLITICO.\nAI generated Text-to-speech\nBERLIN \u2014 German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock has criticized her own government for its indecisiveness on Ukraine aid, signaling deep divisions inside the interim cabinet and growing discord among mainstream political parties amid a heated election campaign.\n\u201cGermany as a whole isn\u2019t currently seen as a driving force for peace policy in Europe, and honestly that pains me,\u201d Baerbock, a leading Greens politician, told POLITICO\u2019s Berlin Playbook Podcast. \u201cEven now, during the election campaign, some prioritize a national perspective \u2014 or how to quickly gain a few votes in the parliamentary election \u2014 rather than taking real responsibility for securing Europe\u2019s peace and freedom.\u201d\nBaerbock\u2019s frustration comes at a time when German Chancellor Olaf Scholz of the Social Democratic Party (SPD) has sparked an intense domestic debate by demanding that new Ukraine aid be contingent on loosening the country\u2019s constitutional fiscal restraints.\nIn an television interview this week, Scholz said he would not agree to a \u20ac3 billion aid package for Ukraine supported by Baerbock and other German leaders across the political spectrum unless it is paid for with new borrowing.\nBecause right-leaning parties like the Christian Democratic Union and the fiscally-conservative Free Democratic Party \u2014\u00a0which broadly favor more aid for Ukraine \u2014 are against taking on new debt to finance the aid, the package is likely to be stalled over the political deadlock.\nBaerbock, who has pushed for passage of the \u20ac3 billion package, has repeatedly voiced concerns about what she views as Germany\u2019s tentative approach to Ukraine aid, arguing that her government is losing the trust of its European allies.\n\u201cThat trust must not be damaged again by hesitation, which could make other countries worry that Germany won\u2019t stand by them,\u201d she said.\nBaerbock also sharply criticized previous German governments for what she views as their failure to heed warnings of the Kremlin\u2019s aggressive intentions. In particular she slammed the Christian Democratic Union (CDU) under former Chancellor Angela Merkel and the SPD \u2014 which previously governed in coalition with the CDU \u2014 for building the controversial Nord Stream 2 pipeline between Russia and Germany.\nAt the time, Merkel repeatedly called construction of the pipeline under the Baltic Sea a \u201cprivate-sector project,\u201d suggesting the German government had a limited role.\n\u201cJust as Nord Stream 2 was never purely an economic project \u2014 despite what the CDU and SPD long wanted to believe \u2014 it\u2019s also no coincidence that undersea data cables in the Baltic Sea keep getting damaged,\u201d Baerbock said, referring to recent suspected cases of Russian sabotage.\nAhead of Germany\u2019s Feb. 23 election, Baerbock\u2019s Greens are polling in fourth place on 14 percent support, far behind the leading conservative alliance under chancellor candidate Friedrich Merz. Should the conservatives win, it\u2019s far from clear which other party or parties they will invite to form a coalition. The conservatives and the Greens, however, do align on many foreign policy issues, including on Ukraine and defense spending.\nBaerbock told POLITICO that Germany needs to invest more in its own security, saying \u201cit\u2019s crucial\u201d that the country consistently invest more than 2 percent of GDP on defense.\n\u201cIn crisis years, that could even approach three percent,\u201d she added.\nIncoming U.S. President Donald Trump has said he wants NATO members to spend a staggering 5 percent of GDP on defense \u2014 more than double the alliance\u2019s current spending target. In the past he referred to Germany as \u201cdelinquent\u201d on defense spending, and has threatened to withhold American protection from NATO countries that don\u2019t pay enough.\nBut Baerbock sounded relatively sanguine about the incoming Trump administration.\n\u201cWe\u2019ll cooperate wherever possible because America remains one of our closest partners and has been a friend for decades,\u201d she said. \u201cBut if things become more difficult in certain areas, Europe won\u2019t be thrown off course.\u201d\nBaerbock suggested Europe could even profit from Trump\u2019s unpredictability, including his recent refusal not to rule out military force to acquire the Panama Canal and Greenland.\n\u201cI just returned from a conference in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd there, topics like Greenland and the Panama Canal were central issues even among our Arab partners. You can sense how absurd these claims seem to so many, and it\u2019s precisely this absurdity that\u2019s pushing actors like Arab nations even closer to Europe.\u201d\nSyria\u2019s transitional government \u201csounds good so far,\u201d Germany\u2019s foreign minister told POLITICO \u2014 but actions speak louder than words.\nEU leaders are discussing the bloc\u2019s economic woes at gathering in Budapest.\nThe decision follows a dramatic breakdown of Germany\u2019s three-party coalition government.\nIf the chancellor\u2019s SPD party loses a crucial regional election to the far right on Sunday, it could lead to his ouster from the top spot.",

And do everything we can to end\u00a0this war as quickly as possible,\" Merz said at a meeting with\u00a0Zelenskyy.\nMerz again indicated that he would be far more open to supplying Ukraine with Germany's long-range Taurus cruise missiles.

            "content": "Germany will not follow the United States in delivering long-range cruise missiles to Ukraine, Chancellor Olaf Scholz says. Officials fear that they could be used against targets within Russia.\nThe Taurus cruise missile is one of the most powerful weapons in the German army's arsenal, and has been at the top of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy's wish list for a long time. However, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz, of the Social Democrats (SPD), continues to reject exports of the weapon to Ukraine.\nWith a\u00a0warhead that can penetrate bunkers, the Taurus cruise missile\u00a0has a range of 500 kilometers (300 miles) and can be fired by a fighter jet. Ukraine wants to use it to attack positions inside Russia from which President Vladimir Putin's military is bombing Ukraine. Russian rocket fire on cities in Ukraine has recently increased again.\nThe debate was reignited in Germany again after US President Joe Biden \u2014 just two months before the end of his term in office \u2014 reportedly decided\u00a0to allow Ukraine to use long-range missiles produced in the United States against targets in Russia. Biden is said to have changed his mind partly because Russia has persuaded North Korea to send thousands of soldiers to fight in the war.\nTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video\nIn view of Ukraine's precarious military situation, more and more people are now calling for Germany to deliver Taurus missiles to Ukraine. However, these can fly significantly further than the American ATACMS missiles, which Ukraine may now use for the first time in the next few days to attack targets in Russia.\nThere has been a renewed push for such deliveries from the Free Democratic Party (FDP), which two weeks ago triggered new elections by leaving Scholz's coalition. The party wants to take this to the Bundestag: It is considering putting a motion to parliament for a vote before the early federal election on February 23.\nOne of the most vehement German supporters of the Taurus delivery is Marie-Agnes Strack-Zimmermann, a member of the European Parliament for the FDP. Referring to Biden's decision, she wrote on the social media platform X: \"I hope that Chancellor Olaf Scholz will have the same belated realization at the end of his term of office in the interest of Europe's security. If he is true to his word that he will act together with his allies, then he must finally act now.\"\nThe conservative\u00a0Christian Democratic Union (CDU), the largest opposition party in the Bundestag, also supports the delivery of Taurus cruise missiles to Ukraine. There is also approval from the Greens, the only remaining coalition partner of the SPD: Robert Habeck, economy minister and his party's chancellor candidate, said he would deliver Taurus cruise missiles to Ukraine if he were leading the government.\nForeign Minister Annalena Baerbock, a fellow Green, also reacted positively to reports that Biden is allowing Ukraine to use long-range missiles against specific targets in Russia, which she said would allow Ukraine to potentially destroy military launch bases from which it is being attacked. Some places in Ukraine are so close to the Russian border that air defense is of no help, the foreign minister said.\nTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video\nSo far, the government has only allowed Ukraine to use German weapons in the Russian territories bordering the city of Kharkiv, which has repeatedly come under heavy fire from the Russian side.\nThough there are many voices in favor of delivering the Taurus, Scholz remains categorically opposed to delivering the weapon system. He argues that Germany runs the risk of being drawn into the war between Russia and Ukraine if the Taurus cruise missiles are used. \"We must not be linked in any way or at any place with the targets that this system achieves,\" he said.\nScholz sees no reason to reconsider this position, his spokesman said on Monday, reaffirming what the chancellor said in his government declaration Wednesday. Scholz continues to receive backing for his course from his party. The delivery of Taurus is out of the question, said SPD leader Saskia Esken: \"We will stick to that.\"\nIn March, the CDU parliamentary group brought a motion calling for the deliveries before the Bundestag. At the time, the parliamentary groups of the SPD, Greens and FDP voted against it unanimously \u2014 in face of opposition from FDP politicians Marie-Agnes Strack-Zimmermann and Wolfgang Kubicki. The motion failed.\nShould the FDP table another motion and should it be adopted, it would still be nonbinding. It is not the Bundestag that decides on arms deliveries, but the Federal Security Council, a secret Cabinet committee chaired by the chancellor.\nThis article was originally written in German.\nWhile you're here: Every Tuesday, DW editors round up what is happening in German politics and society.

The Ukrainian leader had said the move would open a \u201cPandora\u2019s box\u201d by weakening Putin\u2019s international isolation.\nScholz\u2019s visit also comes as he faces a tough battle for re-election at a snap vote in February after his coalition collapsed in November.\nHis record of supporting Ukraine has been under scrutiny both from those who wanted him to do more to help Kyiv and, on the other side, those voters who want Germany to pull back from sending weapons and aid to Ukraine.\nMeanwhile, German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock said Putin is dragging Asia into the war in Ukraine with the use of Chinese-made drones and the deployment of North Korean troops.\n\u201cDrones from Chinese factories and North Korean troops attacking peace in the centre of Europe violate our core European security interests,\u201d Baerbock said after meeting with her Chinese counterpart, Wang Yi, in Beijing.\nAmid the continuing military advance by Russia into Ukraine, Zelenskyy said Ukraine must find diplomatic solutions to retake some of its occupied territory.\nHe said such steps could be considered \u201conly when we know that we are strong enough\u201d, he said in an interview with the Japanese news agency Kyodo published on Monday.\nZelenskyy also said Trump and his team were studying the Ukrainian \u201cvictory plan\u201d and expected additional talks with them to explain \u201ccertain things in more detail\u201d, according to the report.\nMeanwhile, Ukraine\u2019s air force reported that Russia launched 110 drones into the country overnight. One of the drones hit a residential building in the western city of Ternopil, killing one person and injuring several others.\nOf the 110 drones, the air force shot down 52 and 50 were \u201clost\u201d, likely due to electronic warfare, it said.\nOne drone remained in Ukrainian airspace and six of the drones headed towards Belarus and Russia, the air force added.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFollow Al Jazeera English:",

            "summary": "German Chancellor Olaf Scholz described Russia's deployment of North Korean troops in Ukraine as a \"grave escalation\" during a recent phone call with President Vladimir Putin, their first conversation in nearly two years. Scholz urged Putin to end the war, withdraw troops, and negotiate for peace, while condemning Russian attacks on civilians. The Kremlin characterized the dialogue as positive but reiterated its stance on territorial realities post-invasion. Scholz's government faces pressure for peace negotiations ahead of upcoming elections, and he continues to support Ukraine as Germany's largest military donor after the US.",
            "content": "German Chancellor Olaf Scholz told Russian President Vladimir Putin on Friday that Russia\u2019s deployment of North Korean troops against Ukraine was a \u201cgrave escalation\u201d of the conflict, according to government sources.\nIn the first phone call between the leaders in nearly two years, Scholz called on Putin to end the war and pull Russian troops out of Ukraine.\nThe Kremlin described the conversation as \"a detailed and frank exchange of opinions on the situation in Ukraine\u201d, adding \"the very fact of dialogue is positive\".\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said the call was a \u201cPandora\u2019s box\u201d and argued it weakens Putin's isolation.\nAccording to government sources, the chancellor condemned Russia\u2019s attack on Ukraine and called on Moscow to negotiate with Kyiv to come to a \u201cfair and lasting peace\u201d.\nHe also stressed \u201cGermany\u2019s unwavering determination to support Ukraine in its defensive struggle against Russian aggression for as long as necessary\u201d.\nScholz condemned in particular the Russian air strikes on civilian infrastructure.\nThe phone conversation lasted about an hour and both leaders agreed to stay in contact. Russian media is reporting that according to the Kremlin, the call was initiated by Germany.\nThe German government will be keen to avoid any accusations that Berlin is trying to strike a deal with Moscow over Ukraine\u2019s head, particularly given painful 20th century memories in eastern Europe of Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union carving up the region between them.\nIn a written statement, the chancellor\u2019s office highlighted that Scholz also talked to Zelensky before the call to Putin. Scholz also planned to talk to Zelensky again once the call was over to give details about the conversation with the Russian president.\nIn a statement from the Kremlin to Russian media, Putin reportedly told Scholz that Russian-German relations had suffered \"an unprecedented degradation across the board as a result of the German authorities \"unfriendly course\u201d.\nAccording to the Kremlin, Putin told Scholz that any potential peace agreement must \u201cbe based on the new territorial realities\u201d \u2014 in other words the Ukrainian territory that Russia has occupied since 2022.\nPutin also said a peace deal could only happen by removing \u201cthe root causes of the conflict\u201d. The Kremlin justifies its invasion of Ukraine with the accusation of Nato \u201cexpansion\u201d into eastern Europe.\nIn the call, Putin reportedly said \u201cthe current crisis was a direct result of Nato's years-long aggressive policy aimed at creating in Ukrainian territory an anti-Russian bridgehead\u201d.\nIn an interview on German television last Sunday, Scholz said he was planning to talk to Putin to push for peace talks. He said he was not acting on his own, but rather in consultation with others.\nThere is speculation that Scholz is planning to also talk to the Chinese president Xi Jinping, a lukewarm supporter of Russia, about the war in Ukraine at the G20 next week in Rio de Janeiro.\nThe last time Scholz talked to Putin on the phone was on 2 December 2022. They last met in person a week before the full invasion of Ukraine.\nAt the time, Scholz returned to Berlin with promises from Putin that Russia did not intend to invade Ukraine. The attack a week later was the final break in trust between Germany and Russia.\nFor decades, Berlin had tried to ensure peace with Moscow by binding the two countries together with trade and energy links. That aspiration shattered overnight when Russia launched its full invasion of Ukraine.\nToday, Germany is the largest donor of military and financial aid to Ukraine after the US, and mainstream politicians from across the political spectrum, as well as most voters, favour supporting Ukraine.\nBut with elections in Germany now due in February, pressure is growing for serious peace negotiations to end the war in Ukraine.\nThe far-right AfD and the new far-left populist BSW, which together could win between a quarter and third of votes in the election, accuse the government of not doing enough to bring about a peace deal.\nScholz\u2019s governing coalition collapsed last week and he now runs a minority government until the elections. Both he and his party are doing badly in the polls.\nGermany has been hit hard by the war in Ukraine, both politically and economically.\nSo any sign that Scholz is helping to end the conflict could turn around his fortunes at the ballot box.\nAfter 50 years of brutal rule over Syria, Bashar al-Assad and his family have fled to Russia.\nA coroner rejects claims former soldier Daniel Burke of Manchester was accidentally shot by his comrade.\nThe Kremlin says the strikes were in response to Kyiv using US-made missiles to attack its territory.\nMark Rutte urged members to \"turbocharge\" their defence spending to prevent future war with Russia.\nThe presents have been donated by people from the city and beyond.\nCopyright 2024 BBC.

At the same time, he underscored what he said was the importance of \"acting with prudence.\"\nScholz said he opposed delivering long-range missiles early on and that he was right to do so as this would have forced German troops to get involved in target selection deep inside Russia, saying, \"I don't think it would be right\" to participate in the conflict like that.\nTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video\nAlthough he appreciated G20 calls for a cease-fire in Gaza, Scholz said he \"regretted\" that the communique did not address Israel's right to defend itself in the face of threats from Hamas, Hezbollah and Iran as the conflict in the Middle East continues to spread. He was also unhappy that the paper failed to place blame for the spread of the conflict on the militant Islamist group Hamas.\n\"I very much regret that there was no consensus. It would have done the situation good if we had said: everything started with a horrific and brutal terrorist attack on Israel.\"\nThe US, EU, Japan and several other nations have named Hamas a terrorist organization.\nUltimately, said Scholz, \"it is becoming clear how much geopolitical tensions are also having an impact on the G20\u2026 The wind blowing in international relations is getting harsher.\"\nThe leaders' declaration included several aspects based on the priorities of the Brazilian presidency of the group, such as the fight against hunger and climate change as well as reform of global governance.\nIt reaffirmed the Paris Agreement to limit global warming to 1.5 C and called for\u00a0a substantial \"scaling up of climate finance from billions to trillions from all sources\" to support the transition to green energy.\nUS President Joe Biden used the final day of talks to announce\u00a0hundreds of millions of dollars in new climate and development pledges.\nThe G20 also stated an intent to make the UN Security Council more representative.\njs/rt (AFP, Reuters, AP)",

US President Joe Biden, who made the policy change, is also present at the summit.\nMacron acknowledged that the policy\u00a0change was triggered by North Korea sending troops to aid Russia in its war in Ukraine, a move from Moscow that was\u00a0\"a grave change in the conflict which shouldn't be underestimated,\" the French president said.\nHe added that Russia was \"the only power making an escalation in this conflict today\" with the North Korean mobilization. \"So it's really a sudden change in this war that led to the Americans' decision.\"\nGerman Chancellor Olaf Scholz was asked at the G20 summit in Rio de Janeiro on Monday about the supply of German long-range missiles to Ukraine.\nIn Germany's case, Taurus cruise missiles would be the relevant weaponry, something Berlin has not sent to Ukraine.\n\"I have\u00a0explained very clearly why I do not think it is right to supply Taurus cruise missiles,\" Scholz said on the sidelines of the G20 summit in Brazil.\nHe\u00a0said it was important to support Ukraine's defense against Russia's full-scale invasion while still acting \"prudently.\"\nThe missiles could only be used if \"responsibility for targeting\" was shared, Scholz said, a move he has previously said would risk the perception of direct German participation in the war.\n\"That is something that I cannot take responsibility for,\" Scholz said Monday in Rio de Janeiro. \"We have a clear understanding that the powerful weapons we have supplied so far, the long-range artillery, the rocket launchers, cannot be used to penetrate deep into the Russian hinterland.\"\nTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video\nWith snap elections looming in Germany, Scholz also faces a weakened situation domestically and the risk of further damage to the upcoming campaign, with a strong pacifist tradition in postwar Germany that was often particularly prevalent in what his Social Democrats would consider their supporter base, for instance the major trade unions.\nRussian opposition activist Vladimir Kara-Murza believes it is \"counterproductive to engage in any sort of business as usual with Vladimir Putin\" and that the \"only strategic solution [to Russian aggression] is to have a change of government in Russia.\"\nSpeaking to DW at the protest staged by exiled Russians in Berlin on Sunday, Kara-Murza criticized the decision by German Chancellor\u00a0Olaf Scholz to speak to Russian President Vladimir Putin on the phone on Friday and any suggestion of cutting a deal with the Kremlin.\n\"We hear such voices in the West \u2026 voices [which] claim that this is a road to peace,\" he said. \"They couldn't be more wrong on this. If there is some sort of a deal that is cut with Putin over the head of Ukraine without taking in consideration the interests of Ukraine, this will not lead to peace.\"\nFor Kara-Murza, a former ally of murdered Russian\u00a0dissident\u00a0Boris Nemtsov and vice-chairman of the now-outlawed NGO Open Russia, regime change in Moscow is the only option.\n\"Only when Russia has a democratically elected, legitimate government that respects the rights and freedoms of its own people, [will it] also respect the civilized norms of international behavior,\" he said.\n\"Only then will Russia stop being a threat both to itself and to the outside world.\"\nRussian opposition activist Vladimir Kara-Murza has described the recent phone call between German Chancellor Olaf Scholz and Russian President Vladimir Putin as \"symbolic\" \u2014 and not in a good way.\n\"History has shown very clearly what the appeasement of dictators leads to,\" he told DW during an anti-Putin protest staged by exiled Russians in Berlin on Sunday, pointing out that Russia conducted one of its largest bombardments of Ukrainian cities just two days later.\nKara-Murza, who was released from Russian jail as part of the majorprisoner swap in August this year,\u00a0compared the West's attempts to deal with Putin's Russia over the last 20 years to the appeasement of Adolf Hitler and the Nazis in Germany in the 1930s.\n\"What is seen as compromise by the leaders of democratic nations is seen as weakness by dictators,\" he said.\n\"This policy of Western appeasement towards Putin was in a large part responsible for the war of aggression that Putin unleashed in Ukraine, because appeasement of dictators always leads to more aggression.\"\nUS President Joe Biden has urged the leaders of G20 countries to support Ukraine\u2019s sovereignty.\n\"The United States strongly supports Ukraine's sovereignty and territorial integrity. Everyone around this table in my view should as well,\" Biden said in his opening remarks at his final G20 summit.\nRussian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov is also attending the summit that is taking place in Rio de Janeiro.\nThe comment comes after Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskyy seemingly appeared to confirm US media reports that the White House had quietly lifted its ban on Kyiv using US-made long-range weapons to strike inside Russian territory.\nBiden and his government are yet to publicly confirm this.\nHungarian Foreign Minister\u00a0Peter Szijjarto called the relaxation of restrictions on weapons sent to Ukraine by the US is\u00a0\"astonishly dangerous.\"\nHe urged against NATO member states allowing their weapons to be used inside Russian territory.\nAlthough Hungary is a member of both the EU and NATO, Prime Minister Viktor Orban has caused outrage amongst allies for being friendly to Moscow in recent years, going so far as to visit Russia in July for talks with\u00a0President Vladimir Putin.\nDW spoke with retired US Army Lieutenant General Ben Hodges, the former commander of the US Army in Europe, about the change in US policy.\n\"This will enable Ukraine to strike Russian and North Korean headquarters, logistics and artillery that will help disrupt Russian preparations for their attack... that'll be the immediate tactical benefit which will undermine the Russian advantage,\" he said, adding that the move \"significantly degrades Russia's ability to continue its meat grinder tactics.\"\nHodges said that the decision also\u00a0\"increases pressure on Germany to reconsider its very restrictive policy about Taurus.\"\n\"This tells the Russians that the United States we are not turning our back on Ukraine and that their hope that we would just quit is going to fail.\"\nYou can watch the full interview here.\nTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video\nThe office of Chancellor Scholz has said that despite support for the US decision from Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock, Germany had not changed its mind about delivering long-range missiles to Ukraine.\n\"The chancellor's decision is unchanged,\" a spokesman said when asked about sending German Taurus missiles to Kyiv.\nBerlin's position has long been that such a move would draw Germany too deep into the conflict.\nThe European Union has announced that it is widening sanctions against the government\u00a0in Tehran over its support for the Russian military.\nAt a foreign ministers meeting, the bloc decided to prohibit any transactions with ports\u00a0\"used for the transfer of Iranian UAVs or missiles or related technology and components to Russia.\"\nIran-made ballistic missiles are a key component of Russia's war in Ukraine.\nGermany's top diplomat Annalena Baerbock said that backing Moscow \"must and will have consequences\" for Beijing, as doing so is a threat to Europe's \"core security interests.\"\nShe did not give further details on what the consequences for China's alleged funneling of spy drones to Russia might be, but said the European Union was preparing fresh sanctions on Iran for giving the Kremlin ballistic missiles.\nAn unnamed EU official told German news agency DPA that reports of direct\u00a0Chinese military aid were \"extremely worrying,\" but that there was no hard evidence of\u00a0it yet.\nKremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said that President Joe Biden was further inflaming tensions with his decision to allow Kyiv to use American long-range weapons in Russia.\n\"It's obvious that the outgoing administration in Washington intends to take steps in order to continue fuelling the fire and provoking further escalation of tensions,\" he said.\nEuropean leaders have expressed their support for the call from Washington to drop restrictions on Ukraine using long-range missiles supplied by\u00a0Western allies inside Russia.\n\"The decision from the American side, and I would like to emphasize that this is not a rethink but an intensification of what has already been delivered by other partners, is so important at this moment,\" German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock said ahead of a summit for EU top diplomats in Brussels.\nHer French counterpart\u00a0Jean-Noel Barrot echoed her sentiments, saying\u00a0\"we openly said this was an option that we would consider if it was to allow to strike a target from where Russia is currently aggressing Ukrainian territory. So nothing new on the other side.\"\nOutgoing EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell added:\u00a0 \"I've been saying once and again that Ukraine should be able to use the arms we provided to them, in order to not only stop the arrows but also to be able to hit the archers.\"\n\"I continue believing this is what has to be done.

He is taking over from\u00a0Lieutenant General Oleksandr Pavliuk, who had been at the helm\u00a0of the land forces\u00a0since February 2024, also after in a major shake-up.\nThe move comes as\u00a0Ukrainian troops face manpower shortages.\n\"The main task is to increase noticeably the combat efficiency of our army, ensure the quality of servicemen training, and introduce innovative approaches to people management in Ukraine's Armed Forces,\" Zelenskyy said.\n\"The Ukrainian army needs internal changes to achieve our state's goals in full,\" he said on Telegram after meeting his top military and government officials.\nDrapatyi is said to be well respected in the Ukrainian army. He had taken command of the Kharkiv front in May and managed to stop the Russian offensive in the northeast, stabilizing the front.\nGerman Chancellor Olaf Scholz held a phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, where Scholz sought to reassure Ukraine of Germany's continued solidarity.\n\"We will continue our military support for Ukraine in close coordination with our European and international partners,\" Scholz said in a post on\u00a0X\u00a0after the call.\nHe said he had agreed with Zelenskyy to remain in contact \"also with a view to possible paths to a just peace\"\u00a0to end Russia's ongoing invasion of Ukraine.\nFor his part, Zelenskyy thanked Scholz for Germany's help and support, particularly with air defense weapons, in a post on his Telegram channel.\nThe Ukrainian president\u00a0said that Scholz had also discussed\u00a0the details of his recent telephone conversation with Russian President Vladimir Putin.\n\"It is obvious that only the strength of arms and the strength of diplomacy can force the perpetrator of the war to make peace and that this peace can only be achieved through strength,\" Zelenskyy said.\nRussia sentenced jailed former Moscow city councilor Alexei Gorinov to three additional years in prison for criticizing Russia's offensive in Ukraine.\nHe is already serving a seven-year prison sentence for public criticism of the invasion.\nOn Friday, a court in the city of Vladimir, some 198 kilometers (123 miles) northeast of Moscow, handed him the new sentence on charges of \"justifying terrorism\" and ordered that he be transferred to a maximum-security prison.\n\"I am for peace and you like war,\" Gorinov said after the sentence was announced, according to Russian independent news portal Mediazona.\nThe court accused Gorinov of delivering a speech calling for Moscow to end the war in Ukraine and convince inmates to adopt an \"ideology of terrorism.\"\n\"Let's stop this slaughter that nobody needs \u2014 not us, not the citizens of Ukraine,\" Gorinov said in a video recorded in a prison hospital, according to the court.\n\"The guilt that I have is that I, as a citizen of my country, let this war happen and was not able to stop it.\"\nGerman Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock is set to visit China next week, where she will discuss issues such as the war in Ukraine, a ministry spokesperson said.\nWestern leaders have accused China of supporting Russia's war effort by providing dual-use items. Russia saw a surge in Chinese imports starting in 2023.\nChina has not imposed sanctions on Russia and has called for a negotiated settlement to the war.\nThe director of the International Campaign to Ban Landmines (ICBL), Tamar Gabelnick, said that a US offer to provide Kyiv with anti-personnel mines has thrown a global treaty into \"crisis.\"\nUkraine is one of the 164 signatories to the Anti-Personnel Mine Ban Convention. The United States is not party to the treaty.\nWhile speaking at a meeting of signatories in the Cambodian city of Siem Reap, Gabelnick said that the ICBL hoped \"the mines offered by the US will be firmly rejected by Ukraine.\"\nUkrainian defense official Yevhenii Kivshyk said at the same conference that that Kyiv's delegation had \"heard some concerns raised by the community\" that \"will be conveyed to the government of Ukraine.\"\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has called Washington's offer \"very important\"\u00a0for fending off Russian attacks.\nThe international ban on landmines, known as the Ottawa Treaty, was signed in 1997 and prohibits the use, stockpiling, manufacturing or transfer of the weapons.\nTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video\nIn a statement last week, ICBL warned of the \"human cost\" of the potential anti-personnel mine transfer from Washington.\n\"Ukraine already faces decades of demining work due to extensive Russian landmine use. Adding new mines to this contamination will only extend the suffering of civilians and complicate post-conflict recovery efforts,\" the group stressed.\nRussian Defense Minister Andrei Belousov arrived in Pyongyang for talks with North Korean officials and lauded expanding military cooperation between the two countries.\nBelousov said that a strategic partnership signed between North Korea and Russia in June aimed to lower the risk of war by maintaining a \"balance of power\" in the region.\nNorth Korean Defense Minister No Kwang-chol called Russia's war effort in Ukraine a \"just struggle to protect the country's sovereign rights and security interests.\"\nAs Belousov arrived in Pyongyang, North Korean military officials were seen clapping under a banner that read: \"Complete support and solidarity with the fighting Russian army and people.\"\nBelousov is a former economist and replaced Sergei Shoigu as defense minister in May.\nThe Russian official's visit comes days after South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol met with Ukrainian Defense Minister Rustem Umerov in Seoul.\nEarlier this month, Ukraine reported its forces' first clash with North Korean troops who had been deployed to the Russian border region of Kursk.\nThe Ukrainian military said it struck an oil depot in the Rostov region in Russia's northern Caucasus.\n\"Atlas is part of the Russian military-industrial complex that supplies petroleum products to the Russian army,\" Ukraine's military said on the Telegram messaging service.\nAccording to the same statement, Kyiv also struck a radar station used in Russian air defense in Ukraine's southern Zaporizhzhia region.\nZaporizhzhia is one of the four Ukrainian regions Russia claimed to have annexed in September 2022.\nFormer German Chancellor Angela Merkel called for Ukraine and its allies to consider diplomatic solutions to end the war with Russia.\n\"Russia must not win this war,\" Merkel stressed in an interview with German broadcaster ZDF, adding that Moscow's invasion was a \"blatant violation of international law.\"\nMerkel said that she worked to prevent escalation of tensions with Moscow during her time as chancellor from 2005 to 2021.\nIt is \"not only in the interest of Ukraine but also in our interest that [Russian President Vladimir Putin] does not win this war,\" she said.\nTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video\nHowever, Merkel also stressed the need to \"always consider diplomatic solutions in parallel\" to continued military support.\nShe said Kyiv and its allies will have to decide together when \"the right time\" has come for negotiations.\nMerkel said she supported the government of German Chancellor Olaf Scholz's policies on Ukraine, stressing that Berlin is one of Kyiv's biggest supporters.\n\"I support everything the international community is doing to put Ukraine in a good position,\" she said, adding that it would not be easy for Kyiv to achieve military victory against Moscow.\nsdi/zc (AFP, AP, dpa, Reuters)",

            "content": "The Ukrainian president is in Brussels to meet European leaders. The meeting takes place ahead of Donald Trump's return to the White House, amid questions on the future of US aid for Ukraine. DW has the latest.\nThis is a roundup of major stories from or related to Russia's invasion of Ukraine on December 18, 2024.\u00a0This blog has now closed.\nVolodymyr Zelenskyy said he discussed with French President Emmanuel Macron the possibility of sending Western troops to Ukraine.\nMacron floated the idea of sending ground troops to Ukraine earlier this year, in a sharp departure from other Western leaders, who have repeatedly said they want to avoid an escalation of the war in Ukraine.\n\"We share a common vision: reliable guarantees are essential\u00a0for a peace that can truly be achieved,\" Zelenskyy wrote on X.\n\"We continued working on President Macron's initiative\u00a0regarding the presence of forces in Ukraine that could\u00a0contribute to stabilizing the path to peace.\"\nChancellor Olaf Scholz, like Rutte, stressed the importance of sequencing before the meeting. For now, Scholz said, the priority was providing Ukraine as much military assistance as possible.\nIn terms of the prospect of ceasefire talks or implementation, he said Ukraine first needed to make clear what its goals for a peace deal would be.\n\"No decision should be made above Ukraine's head,\"\u00a0Scholz said, while also warning that a potential deal must not amount to a\u00a0\"dictated peace.\"\nHowever, Scholz also voiced confidence in the chances of a continued, united NATO policy on Ukraine after the change in occupancy at the White House.\nHe said his recent phone call with Donald Trump had shown him\u00a0\"that it is possible for us to develop\u00a0our policies together so that Ukraine can have a positive outlook.\"\nScholz will likely be leaving his post as chancellor fairly soon after Trump's inauguration, with early elections set for late February in Germany.\nAhead of his meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, NATOSecretary General Mark Rutte said the priority for Wednesday's meeting was to \"make sure that Ukraine has what it needs\"\u00a0to prevent Russia and its president Vladimir Putin from winning the war.\nRutte declined to comment on what a potential ceasefire might look like, amid speculation of a change in course after Donald Trump's inauguration, saying it was important to first \"focus on the business at hand.\"\nRutte, the Netherlands' prime minister until July, has been filling the role as NATO's secretary general since October.\nNot for the first time in recent months, a short-notice appearance from Ukraine's Volodymyr Zelenskyy has somewhat stolen the show from the original main event.\nHowever, Wednesday's talks in Brussels are first and foremost, at least nominally, the latest of several summits on the slow process to usher six Western Balkan countries \u2014\u00a0Albania, Bosnia,\u00a0Kosovo, Montenegro, North Macedonia and Serbia \u2014\u00a0towards EU membership.\nDW's senior correspondent in Brussels Bernd Riegert does not expect any major movement on the issue:\nYet another Western Balkan summit is taking place here in Brussels, but no concrete decisions are on the table. No accession date will be given to any of the six countries.\nSome of the six leaders are not satisfied that they might yet have to wait years for an accession date. Some are actually getting impatient. Some leaders are frustrated that nothing has actually happened, and also that the EU does not appear fit to take in new members.\nAt the summit, the EU will seek to reassure the West Balkan countries that they are still most welcome, also for geopolitical reasons after Russia's aggression against Ukraine. We may hear warm words, but expect little real progress.\nNATO Secretary General Mark Rutte told reporters in Brussels on Wednesday that a NATO command in Wiesbaden in western Germany set up to assist Ukraine and provide training for its troops was now functional.\n\"The NATO command in Wiesbaden for security assistance and training for Ukraine is now up and running,\"\u00a0Rutte said.\nWiesbaden is also home to a major US Army base. Plans for the facility first emerged late in 2022, just a few months after Russia's invasion.\nUkraine's\u00a0President Volodymyr Zelenskyy will meet NATO\u00a0chief Mark Rutte and other key European leaders in Brussels to discuss the \"next steps\" in Russia's war, as Italy's Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni put it.\nThe evening's gathering was expected to involve leaders from Germany, Poland, Italy, Denmark and the EU.\nZelenskyy said\u00a0the leaders would discuss \"how to urgently strengthen Ukraine on the battlefield, politically and geopolitically.\" NATO, meanwhile, said the talks would focus on continued support for Ukraine, particularly in terms of air defense.\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron and British Prime Minister Keir starmer are set to miss the meeting due to schedule clashes, but said they would send\u00a0their foreign ministers instead.\nThe meeting comes just over a month before US President-elect Donald Trump moves into the White House, amid uncertainty on his approach to Ukraine.\nTrump has repeatedly said he would bring a swift\u00a0end to the conflict between Ukraine and Russia, without elaborating on how, prompting concerns he may\u00a0pull US support from Kyiv to force the country to make concessions to Moscow.\nRussian authorities said on Wednesday that they had detained an Uzbek citizen\u00a0after a senior general was killed by a bomb hidden in an electric scooter.\n\"A national of Uzbekistan, born in 1995, was arrested on suspicion of having committed the attack that cost the life of the commander of Russian radiological, chemical and biological defense forces, Igor Kirillov, and his assistant, Ilya Polikarpov,\" the Investigative Committee said in a statement.\nIt claimed that the 29-year-old suspect had admitted being \"recruited by Ukrainian special forces,\" while Russia's state TASS news agency said the man had been offered $100,000 and travel to the European Union.\nUkraine has also claimed responsibility for the killing.\nYou can read the full story here.",

The party's manifesto includes radical proposals such as closing borders, resuming Russian gas imports, quitting the Paris climate agreement, and exiting the Euro. Party leader Alice Weidel embraced the controversial term \"remigration,\" hinting at mass deportations of migrants. Despite rising poll numbers and regional gains, the AfD faces barriers to power due to other parties' refusal to collaborate. Weidel's statements and the party's growing radicalism raise concerns of Nazi revisionism and extremist ideologies within German politics.",
            "content": "Germany's far right is in a buoyant mood.\nOn Saturday, while its conference was under way in the eastern town of Riesa, in Saxony, Alternative f\u00fcr Deutschland (AfD) laid out ambitions to close Germany's borders, resume buying Russian gas and, in effect, dismantle the EU.\nGerman media reported that party's agreed manifesto includes plans to quit the Paris climate deal, exit the Euro currency and create a new confederation of states.\nThe AfD's leader, Alice Weidel, even publicly embraced the term \"remigration\" - a word that's widely understood to mean the mass \"return\" or deportation of people with a migrant background.\nThousands of anti-AfD protestors swarmed the streets in Riesa on Saturday, seeking to obstruct access to the conference venue.\nWhen Alice Weidel eventually took to the stage, she described the activists outside as a \"left-wing mob.\"\nAnd, in front a delighted conference hall of delegates, spoke of \"large-scale repatriations\".\n\"And I have to be honest with you: if it's going to be called remigration, then that's what it's going to be: remigration,\" she said.\nIt's a striking departure from just a year ago when she sought to distance herself from a scandal that centred on the highly controversial concept.\nThere were nationwide anti-AfD demonstrations after it emerged that senior party figures had been among those at a meeting where \"remigration\" was allegedly discussed with Martin Sellner, an Austrian far-right activist who has a neo-Nazi past.\nSellner has written about \"remigrating\" asylum seekers, some foreigners with residency rights and \"non-assimilated\" citizens.\nA buzzword in Europe's far-right, some claim legal residents wouldn't be forced to leave. Critics say \"remigration\" is simply a euphemism for an overtly racist mass deportation plan.\nBut Alice Weidel's decision to personally coin the term, weeks out from a snap federal election, demonstrates her party's growing radicalism and confidence.\nShe also pledged to tear down wind farms which she called \"windmills of shame\", leave the EU's asylum system and \"throw out\" gender studies professors.\nThe AfD is consistently polling second in Germany and made gains in recent regional elections in the country's east \u2013 where the party is strongest.\nHowever, it's highly unlikely to win power because other parties won't work with the AfD.\nSections of the AfD have been classed by domestic intelligence as right-wing extremist.\nIn 2024, a talisman of the AfD's hard-right \u2013 Bj\u00f6rn H\u00f6cke \u2013 was fined twice for using a banned Nazi SA paramilitary phrase, \"Alles f\u00fcr Deutschland\" (\"everything for Germany\").\nHe's called it an \"everyday sentence\" and denied being aware of its origins, despite formerly being a history teacher.\nReports that members of the conference in Riesa this weekend chanted \"Alice f\u00fcr Deutschland\" drew quick comparisons in German media.\nHowever, AfD figures have frequently complained that they are demonised and persecuted by a biased media and establishment.\nAnd Alice Weidel's party \u2013 of which she is the co-leader and now Chancellor candidate \u2013 has ridden out repeated storms to now hover around or even above 20% in national polls.\nThe 45-year-old economist, who previously worked for Goldman Sachs and is in a same-sex relationship, has sought to polish the rougher edges of her party.\nBut for those strongly opposed to the AfD she is a fig leaf or - as one Social Democrat put it - a \"wolf in sheep's clothing\".\nRegardless, she's enjoying a new spotlight after being invited by tech billionaire \u2013 Elon Musk \u2013 for a live talk on his X platform last week, where he wholeheartedly endorsed the party.\nHer declaration during this discussion that Adolf Hitler was, in fact, a communist  sparked condemnation, given the Nazi leader's well-known anti-communism.\nCritics warned of Nazi revisionism - something the AfD has been accused of before.\nBj\u00f6rn H\u00f6cke once called for a \"180-degree turnaround\" in Germany's handling of its Nazi past while a former co-leader, Alexander Gauland, described the Nazi era as \"just a speck of bird's muck in more than 1,000 years of successful Germany history\".\nNevertheless, the AfD's anti-establishment, anti-immigration and anti-\"woke\" agenda is finding followers in Germany who go to the polls on 23 February.\nGermany's Bundestag descends into recrimination after a \"firewall\" against working with the far-right cracks.\nWorld leaders rubbed shoulders with 56 survivors of Hitler's death camp as they marked 80 years since its liberation.\nIt is 80 years since Soviet Union troops liberated Auschwitz - now marked as Holocaust Memorial Day.\nFifty survivors - now in their late 80s and 90s - will attend a ceremony marking the camp's liberation.\nGerman meat and dairy products are banned in Guernsey after an outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease.\nCopyright 2025 BBC.

The AfD's stance, rooted in nationalism and Euroscepticism, faces widespread unpopularity among the German public, with a survey indicating 87% support for remaining in the EU. Political analysts suggest the proposal may be a strategic move reflecting rising Euroscepticism in Europe.",
            "content": "Germany's far-right AfD has stated in its draft election manifesto that it wants to leave the EU and the euro in Brexit-like fashion. What consequences would this have for Germany and the bloc?\nThe far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) has doubled down on its pledge to take Germany out of the European Union and the single currency, the euro, if it gained power.\nIn a draft election manifesto sent to its members ahead of a vote in the party conference scheduled for early January, the anti-immigration party repeated a promise from its European election campaign in the summer, saying, \"We consider it necessary for Germany to leave the European Union and to establish a new European community.\"\nIn place of the EU, the AfD wants to introduce something it calls a \"Europe of fatherlands\" \u2014 an association of states that would include a common market and an \"economic and interests community.\"\nThe AfD also wants to take Germany out of Europe's common euro currency which was introduced in 2002, and replace it with what it calls a \"transfer union.\" The party admits in the manifesto that a \"hard cut\" would be counterproductive and proposes renegotiating relations with all the member states as well as other European countries.\nThe AfD wants Germany to hold a referendum on the issue \u2014 though actually getting out of the EU wouldn't be that easy, since Germany's membership is anchored in the German Constitution, the Basic Law. Even if some future AfD-led German government were to declare Germany's exit from the EU, it would effectively be unconstitutional, as a \"Dexit\" would also require a two-thirds majority in the German parliament.\nTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video\nThe AfD's plan does represent a toughening of the party's position on the EU: It was only in February 2024 that the party's co-leader Tino Chrupalla said that it was \"too late\" for Germany to leave the EU.\nHis co-leader and the party's chancellor candidate Alice Weidel described Dexit merely as a \"Plan B\" in an interview with the British Financial Times earlier this year.\nGermany's leading economic institutes and industry associations have all condemned the proposal. The Cologne-based German Economic Institute (IW) concluded in a study in May this year that, over five years, leaving the EU would cost the country \u20ac690 billion ($725 billion), cause the country's GDP to shrink by 5.6%, and would mean 2.5 million fewer jobs on the market. The damage would be \"comparable with the coronavirus crisis and the energy crisis put together,\" the IW study said.\nThe German Association of Small and Medium Businesses (BVMW) was even more excoriating, describing the AfD's plan as an \"economic kamikaze mission.\"\nIn a statement released ahead of the EU election in June 2024, the BVMW set out all the positives that the single currency brings to small and medium-sized businesses: \"The monetary union is a useful complement to the EU single market. The EU single market makes it considerably easier for companies to sell goods and services in other EU countries. The euro helps to eliminate incalculable risks for companies in trade.\"\nTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video\nRonald Gl\u00e4ser, an AfD spokesperson in Berlin, dismissed these concerns.\n\"Yes, Germany profits from the EU, but we believe that we would have the advantages of it if we arrived at other agreements,\" Gl\u00e4ser told DW. \"And when economists claim that it would be an economic catastrophe, then all I can do is ask: Are those the same ones who said Europe and England would be terribly affected? I can remember all the horror scenarios around Brexit, and it all went more or less smoothly.\"\nA report released by Cambridge Econometrics in January this year found that Brexit is stifling growth and employment in the UK, with an estimated three million fewer jobs in the country by 2035.\nThe IW's study was based on studying the effects of Brexit on the regions of Britain that have similar economies to equivalent regions in Germany.\n\"Our estimate was fairly conservative,\" warned IW's executive director Hubertus Bardt, who co-authored the report. \"We could easily have much stronger effects because we are more closely intertwined in the EU than the British were \u2014 we have the euro, which would mean more complications than the British had.\"\nDexit would mean that \"we would be over 5 and a half percent poorer in five years' time,\" Bardt told DW. \"That's a severe economic crisis with advanced warning.\" It would of course be particularly damaging for companies that depend on markets and suppliers elsewhere in the EU, he added.\nThe AfD's Gl\u00e4ser believes that an alternative version could still preserve free trade.\n\"Why should all the companies and consumers in Italy, France, Sweden, or wherever, not want German products anymore just because we're not in the EU anymore?\" he said. \"Switzerland isn't in the EU, and it exports to all these countries.\"\nBut Bardt had no time for the AfD's plan to replace the EU with a different economic community: \"I consider this to be an unrealistic and meaningless notion or a smokescreen,\" he said. \"Destroying the EU will not result in a new and better integration model emerging in its place.\"\nTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video\nNor is Dexit even remotely popular among the German population \u2014 a survey published earlier this year by the Konrad Adenauer Foundation (KAS) \u2014 which is affiliated with the conservative Christian Democratic Union (CDU) \u2014 found that 87% of Germans would vote to stay in the EU in a referendum.\nSo why has the AfD decided to include such a drastic and unpopular measure in its election manifesto? Gl\u00e4ser insisted that leaving the EU would be good for Germans, whether they liked it or not: \"We don't do policies based on surveys \u2014 we want to implement what is necessary and important.\"\nWolfgang Schroeder, a political scientist at Kassel University, pointed out that the AfD's stance is consistent with its foundation \u2014 the party initially emerged in 2013 as a party of economists critical of the EU's bailouts following the euro crisis. Since then, it has drifted further right and anti-immigration, but its Euroscepticism has remained \u2014 though it is now less obvious.\n\"The AfD is primarily a nationalist party,\" Schroeder told DW. \"It opposes globalization \u2014 that has always brought with it a skeptical attitude to international authorities. For them, all international organizations like the EU and the UN have their own aims and values, and so are a danger to the true will of the people.\"\nBut is the AfD serious about its proposal to replace the EU with another kind of international community, given the economic and constitutional headaches that this would cause?\n\"We could answer that in two ways,\" said Schroeder. \"On the one hand, we could say they don't mean it seriously because they know they're representing a minority position, so they can formulate it simply to paint a picture of a different world \u2014 it doesn't cost them anything to say it.\"\nPersonally, Schroeder thinks the AfD position is kind of a cheap long-term bet: \"They're betting that more and more countries that agree with this Euroskepticism, and that in future there will be a new development that goes in the direction of Eurasia, with new economic and political prospects.\"\nEdited by Rina Goldenberg\nWhile you're here: Every Tuesday, DW editors round up what is happening in German politics and society.

However, challenges include tight deadlines for obtaining and returning ballots, which may hinder participation. Voters must register with their last German residence, but many do not. In the last election, only about 130,000 voted from abroad. To facilitate voting, embassies offer courier services for ballot transportation, yet using express mail may be quicker. Eligible voters are encouraged to act promptly to ensure their votes count.",
            "content": "Three to four million Germans living abroad are entitled to vote in the upcoming snap German elections on February 23. But there are a few snags.\nChristian Wagner, spokesperson for German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock, has some advice for Germans living abroad: If you want to make sure that your vote counts in the Bundestag election\u00a0on February 23, get your election documents now, because getting the ballot paper with the party candidates in time, filling it out and sending it back to Germany in time is not easy.\nThis year's election date was only decided after Germany's Social Democrat chancellor, Olaf Scholz, lost his vote of confidence in the Bundestag in mid-December, paving the way for German President Frank-Walter Steinmeier to set the election date for February 23, 2025.\nWagner warned: \"Tight deadlines mean that even normal German parliamentary elections are challenging in some countries. Depending on where they live, some Germans living abroad may not receive their ballot papers in time.\" In regular elections, German embassies and consulates abroad start preparing months before an election \u2014 now they have just a few weeks.\nGermans living abroad who want to vote have to register on the electoral roll of one of the 299 constituencies in Germany. This is normally the person's last place of residence in Germany. But some countries handle this differently: For example, when Turkey held a run-off for the presidential elections in May 2023, around 1.5 million Turkish citizens in Germany were entitled to vote. They were able to do so at 17 different locations, including consulates, in Germany.\nThis is not possible in the Bundestag elections: \"In Germany, there is no provision for simply voting in an embassy. We simply don't have that in our electoral system,\" Wagner conceded. But it is now possible to simply send an email to the electoral district in Germany asking for the documents to be sent.\nTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video\nThere are only rough estimates of how many people this actually affects. \"There is no obligation to register abroad, so we can only estimate how many Germans are abroad, and how many of them are eligible to vote,\" said Wagner. \"We assume a total of three to four million.\" Many more Germans live abroad, but not all are entitled to vote.\nAs a rule, all Germans who have lived in Germany for at least three months without interruption after their 14th birthday are eligible to vote. But there are exceptions: For example, the stay must not date back more than 25 years. In other words, Germans who have only been in Germany briefly from time to time, are not eligible to vote. That obviously also applies to those with a German passport who have never set foot in the Federal Republic.\nThe only exception to these rules are for people who are, \"for other reasons, personally and directly acquainted with the political circumstances in Germany and affected by them.\" If they can prove it, of course. This might, for example, affect people who work in Germany or hold shares in German companies, which employ many people.\nIt all sounds complicated, and it is \u2014 which is probably one of the reasons why only about 130,000 Germans living abroad out of three to four million eligible voters voted in the last Bundestag election in 2021. The majority of these lived in EU countries and other European states such as the UK or Turkey.\nOnly 7,700 Germans in the USA, 5,300 in Asia and only 1,500 in the whole of Africa, Canada and Australia combined voted.\nTime is running out for Germans abroad who want to apply. Wagner promises that the 154 or so German embassies around the world and the 50 or so general consulates will help: \"We are of course looking at what we can do to provide support. When it comes to delivering election documents, we have actually made it possible to use the official courier service.\"\nIn other words: If you wish, you can bring your completed voting documents to an embassy in a sealed envelope. From there, the German Foreign Office will organize transportation to Berlin or to the Bonn office. From there, it will be sent by post to the electoral constituencies, where it must be received by 6 p.m. on February 23 at the latest.\nThat also sounds complicated, which is why Wagner says: \"Sometimes a commercial express mail delivery service is simply quicker.\" In practice, then, the best way for Germans living abroad to exercise their right to vote is probably to get the documents sent from a constituency in Germany, fill them out and send them back immediately by express mail.\nThis article was translated from German.\nWhile you're here: Every Tuesday, DW editors round up what is happening in German politics and society.

Recent reforms have relaxed citizenship requirements, allowing international residents to apply after five years, with dual nationality now permitted.

Activists argue that inclusive voting rights could enhance political participation for those with international backgrounds. Despite voting restrictions, non-citizens can still engage politically through demonstrations and party involvement.",
            "content": "Germany's lack of birthright citizenship, longtime laws against dual citizenship, and long naturalization waiting times mean many yearslong and even lifetime residents cannot vote in the place they live and work.\nGermany is organized as a federal state and parliamentary democracy, and the German constitution, also known as the Basic Law, is clear: \"the people vote\" (\"das Volk w\u00e4hlt\"). But who are \"the people\"?\nAround 59.2 million Germans in Germany will be eligible to vote in the upcoming federal election on February 23, according to the Statistical Office.\nHowever, around 10 million people living in Germany won't be able to cast a vote because they aren't German citizens. That means about 14% of Germany's adult population will be excluded from voting because of their nationality.\nBritish-born activist Phil Butland used to be one of them. He moved to Germany back in the 1990s and first got involved in politics as part of the anti-globalization movement ATTAC\u00a0and until recently was a member of the Left party.\n\"For a long time, my permanent residence has been Germany, my life has been in Germany, everything I do is in Germany and it was a bit of an anomaly not to be able to take part in elections there,\" he told DW.\nPreviously, Butland was reluctant to apply for German citizenship because he was unemployed at the time\u00a0and was told that he could only gain German citizenship if he was earning above a certain amount.\n\"They\u00a0have relaxed the rules now,\" Butland said, \"but if you don't have a job or you have a low-paying job the rules are still a lot harder than if you've got a well-paying job there. There is exclusion of poor people in most of these rules.\"\nThe German government eased its rules around the granting of citizenship in January 2024, in an attempt to make Germany more attractive to skilled workers internationally and help to ease labor shortages.\nUnder the new law, international residents are able to apply for\u00a0German citizenship after five years and in exceptional cases, three years. Previously, people had to live in the country for eight years.\nThe changes also allow for people to hold dual nationality, a privilege formerly reserved for citizens of other EU countries or Switzerland.\n\"The citizenship reforms mean that, even in the best-case scenario, if we include the administrative time, then we are talking about a period of at least four to six, seven years during which the people cannot have their say and that is, of course, not good for the quality of a democracy,\" said \u00d6zg\u00fcr \u00d6zvatan, CEO of the political consultancy Transformakers\u00a0and the author of a forthcoming book on the political impact of Germans with an international background.\nObtaining German citizenship isn't easy, not least because of the associated costs of applying, including fees to have documents such as birth certificates\u00a0translated by an officially\u00a0authorized translator, and\u00a0German language proficiency and proof of earnings requirements.\nThe \"democratic deficit\" in Germany, as \u00d6zvatan describes it, is especially problematic for a country with a particularly high need for immigration to offset the labor shortages caused by an aging and shrinking population \u2014 and highlights an obvious disconnect in German politics.\n\"At the policy level, there were reforms that the government introduced that meant there was a liberalization [of citizenship rights], but at the rhetorical level there was a very hard regression,\" he said, referring to the intensification of anti-immigration rhetoric used by German politicians and parties across the political spectrum.\n\"This naturally raises the question: Do I want to stay in this country at all? And if I don't want to stay in this country, do I even want to apply for citizenship or do I not need it at all?\"\nThe debate over whether to allow non-German citizens living in Germany to vote has dragged on for decades. It began\u00a0in the 1970s amid rising controversy over the rights of what are referred to in German society as \"guest workers\" (\"Gastarbeiter\") \u2014 migrant workers recruited from countries such as Italy, Greece and Turkey from the late 1950s \u2014 to acquire residency and citizenship rights.\nReforms to the Citizenship Act that came into force on January 1, 2000, extended the right to German citizenship previously based exclusively on the principle of descent (jus sanguinis or \"right of blood\" where nationality is inherited through parents) to include the principle of place of birth (jus soli or \"right of soil\").\nThe reforms meant that children born in Germany to foreign parents could also acquire German citizenship, but only under certain conditions.\nUnder the Federal Election Act, all German citizens who have reached the age of 18 on election day and have lived in Germany for at least three months or are resident\u00a0in the country on a regular basis are eligible to vote in federal elections and state elections. This includes German citizens living abroad, provided they register in time.\nEuropean Union citizens who are resident in Germany are able to vote at the municipal level and in EU elections.\nTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video\nThe right for non-German citizens to vote at the municipal level was introduced in the northern state of Schleswig-Holstein and the neighboring city-state of Hamburg.\u00a0However, this was ultimately declared unconstitutional by the Federal Constitutional Court in 1990 after it ruled that while all state authority emanates from the people, this specifically refers to the people of the state, meaning German citizens.\n\"In most cases it is easier to change access to citizenship rather than voting rights, because voting rights are part of the constitution. But nothing is likely to change after the next election,\" said Tobias Sp\u00f6ri, a senior researcher at d|part, a think tank focusing on the issue of political participation.\nHe said the fact that the political climate in Germany has shifted so heavily to the right in recent years means none of the mainstream political parties running for election in February are talking about a more inclusive electoral system \u2014 and are in fact moving in the opposite direction.\n\"[Christian Democrat leader] Friedrich Merz has already said that even if people have received German citizenship years ago you can also take it away,\" Sp\u00f6ri told DW.\nThe issue of voting rights also has an impact on who is sitting in parliament and who is represented there, Sp\u00f6ri explained.\nIn Germany, around 11% of members of the Bundestag federal parliament have an international background. In the parliaments of each of the 16 federal states the proportion is only around 7%, and in some parts of eastern Germany less than 1%.\n\"It's important to give people the prospect of getting voting rights independent from their citizenship,\" he said. \"What you can see in our research is that the possibility of access to voting rights empowers people, because then they feel really politically integrated and there's also more political participation independent from elections.\"\nWhile changes to who has the right to vote in Germany are unlikely to happen anytime soon, foreign nationals\u00a0living in the country can still exert political pressure in other ways, for example by joining a political party or campaign group and participating in demonstrations and strikes \u2014 rights Phil Butland values highly.\n\"I'm an old-fashioned believer in demonstrations, in strikes even, in putting pressure on politicians so that even if you can't vote for them then at least you can make them aware of your presence and of your demands, and that's something where there isn't an exclusion based on nationality,\" he said.\nEdited by: Kyra Levine\nWhile you're here: Every Tuesday, DW editors round up what is happening in German politics and society.

However, political instability in Germany, following the collapse of the government coalition, threatens funding and progress, as a national budget is uncertain. The government had allocated \u20ac30 billion-\u20ac50 billion for this initiative over three years, but delays are likely. Despite the challenges, train driver Tyler Bosselman remains optimistic about the future of DB, which he views as critical infrastructure, and is pursuing further education to contribute to its transformation.",
            "content": "Deutsche Bahn is investing big in addressing public perceptions of the German national rail carrier as hugely dysfunctional. But political disarray in Berlin has knocked it off track.\nTyler Bosselman was wearing the\u00a0dark blue vest and\u00a0the red tie of a\u00a0Deutsche Bahntrain driver. As he sat comfortably in the operator's seat\u00a0of his regional DB train, the\u00a0landscapes of southern Germany rushed by outside, reflected\u00a0in\u00a0his sunglasses.\nConstruction is underway on one of the routes that the 24-year-old Bosselman drives. It's the busy Riedbahn route between Frankfurt and Mannheim in Germany, which is getting new switches and signals to make rail traffic run more smoothly. The goal is to finish the overhaul by the end of December, and Bosselman hopes that the upgrade will make Deutsche Bahn \"more reliable overall.\"\nReconstruction of the Riedbahn route marks the beginning of what Germany's state-owned railway operator touted as a reboot of the company, with routes to Hanover, Hamburg and other busy sections of its nationwide network set to follow soon.\nDB's so-called comprehensive reconstruction\u00a0plan involves a total of 40 major construction projects\u00a0and aims to ensure that the operator's infamously unpunctual trains will be running on time again by the end of\u00a0the decade. At the program's launch this summer, German Transportation Minister Volker Wissing called it Germany's \"largest reconstruction\u00a0and modernization program in recent decades.\"\nDB's\u00a0plans could soon come to\u00a0a screeching halt. The collapse of the three-party German government coalition on November 6, and fresh elections to be held on February 23 next year at the earliest, mean the country is stuck in political limbo for half a year, and so is funding for the rail program.\nMartin Burkert, chairman of the EVG rail workers union, has already warned that, without a 2025 national budget, there would be a lack of money to carry on with the projects. \"Years of planning work to finally get the infrastructure up to date and improve the punctuality and capacity of the network is now at risk,\" Burkert told the German news agency, dpa, recently.\nBosselman knows all too well how necessary the overhaul of DB's rail network\u00a0is. Every day, the train driver navigates his engine through a web of construction sites in and around the Frankfurt rail hub. \"It's like when you are going to a casino. It's like you're gambling and hoping that you are on time. During rush hours, there is absolutely no guarantee that you are getting there in any reasonable time,\" Bosselman told DW.\nAn active union member, Bosselman can share many stories about what goes wrong at DB. While most regional trains still manage to be fairly punctual, he says, almost one in three long-distance trains in Germany now arrives late. Yet they are usually given priority on the crowded tracks thus holding up slower trains or idling them on sidetracks until they pass by. \"It doesn't matter if it is on a Monday, a Wednesday or any other day in the week. You can basically mark the day in your calendar that you make it into Frankfurt central station without having to slow down once.\"\nDB's infrastructure backlog is not only evident in the carrier's\u00a0lack of punctuality, but has also increasingly manifested itself in a thinned-out network that has been shrinking for years. Surprisingly, this has happened against the backdrop of rising demand for its services, with goods volumes and passenger numbers having increased at the same time.\nBosselman said you could see the ruins left by a chronically underfunded rail company every day. As we pass a steel bridge, he points\u00a0to rusty, moss-covered tracks nearby, which he says have been disused for a long time. \"You could have a much higher volume of traffic here, if you invested a few euros into this replacement track.\"\nAt the end of the 1990s, Germany was hit by a severe economic crisis, with the government cutting spending wherever possible. Deutsche Bahn, which is fully owned by the state, became an easy target for the cuts leading to a dramatic decline of investment in rail infrastructure.\nAlthough this has changed in recent years, the government still spends comparatively little money on Germany's railway infrastructure. According to the Pro-Rail Alliance \u2014 a lobby group that unites nonprofit pro-rail campaigners with railway sector companies \u2014 Germany spends about \u20ac115 ($121) per capita on its railways\u00a0annually, while countries such as Austria or Switzerland invest three to four times as much.\nTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video\nThe Federal Court of Auditors \u2014 an independent body that audits the federal budget and oversees the management of public funds\u00a0\u2014 highlighted the years of neglect and current underfunding in a recent report. It declared Deutsche Bahn a \"case for restructuring,\" and lambasted the government for having \"failed to address key rail policy questions for three decades.\"\nThe comprehensive reconstruction plan was supposed to be the answer to many of DB's woes, with the government earmarking \u20ac30 billion-\u20ac50 billion for\u00a0the endeavor over the next three years. But now, after the collapse of the government, Germany has no budget for the next year which could threaten the funding for some of the rail projects.\nChristian B\u00f6ttger, a professor at\u00a0the Berlin University of Applied Sciences for Technology and Economics whose research areas include railroads, said he believed that DB would get the money one day, but only after a new government has been formed. \"A cancellation by a new government seems politically very unlikely to me, but even the already imminent postponement of construction projects is, of course, a disaster,\" he told DW.\nBosselman is not too worried about deep cuts to railway funding in the future. He said politicians had realized that DB is part of Germany's \"critical infrastructure.\" However,\u00a0he believes that the current budget shortfalls will come at the expense of DB's\u00a0reboot. \"In Germany, roads have always taken precedence over rail, and that's why I feel that cuts to rail are more likely.\"\nBosselman intends to stay positive, as he believes that there's already \"a lot of negativity\u00a0going around\" in German politics. \"If you kind of give in to all that negativity, your life won't be too positive down the road,\" he said. \"I can't see myself sad or disappointed in everything,\" he added. \"There is always something to look up for.\"\nSo, instead of complaining about his employer, he aims to boost his career at the end of the year\u00a0with a master's degree in railway operations, which, he said, could be a \"door-opener to a leadership role\" so that he can try to \"transform Deutsche Bahn from the inside.\"\nAnd some German passengers, though small in numbers, also have a reason for hope regarding improvements in\u00a0rail services. DB announced a few weeks ago that the reconstruction of the Riedbahn would soon be completed, with service on the route scheduled to resume by mid-December \u2014 surprisingly for the rail operator, this would be right on schedule and just in time to complete the first project of the reconstruction plan ahead of the country's fresh elections.\nThis article was originally written in German.\nEditor's note:\u00a0An earlier version of this article incorrectly stated that the German ruling coalition collapsed on November 4. It has been corrected to state that the coalition collapsed on November 6.\nWhile you're here: Every Tuesday, DW editors round up what is happening in German politics and society.

That paved the way for an early election on February 23.\nContenders to lead the next government have made contrasting proposals on how to inject new vigour into the economy.\nRuth Brand, the head of the statistics office, ticked off the list of short- and long-term challenges: higher energy prices after the loss of cheap natural gas from Russia; high interest rates from the European Central Bank that deter investment in new machinery and vehicles; and consumers worried about the future who are saving their wages instead of spending them.\nSpending on hotels and restaurants sagged by 4.4pc and outlays for clothing and shoes fell by 2.8pc despite rising disposable income.\nOn top of that comes increasing competition for export markets from China in traditional areas of German strength such as cars, industrial machinery and chemicals.\nMore chronic issues include excessive bureaucracy and a shortage of skilled labour.\n\u201cGerman exports saw themselves exposed to stronger international competition, not least from the People's Republic of China,\u201d Ms Brand said. \u201cGerman exports shrank although world trade increased in 2024.\u201d\n\u201cThe German economy is mired in stagnation,\u201d said Nils Jannsen of the Kiel Institute for the World Economy.

It aims for a\u00a0gradual increase in the number of homes and buildings heated with renewable energy, and for 6 million oil and gas\u00a0heating systems to be replaced with heat pumps by 2030.\n\"The law is better than its reputation, but disastrous in terms of how it was communicated,\" said Claudia Kemfert, an energy economist with economic think tank DIW Berlin. But with only some 1.8 million new heat pumps installed, the country is lagging far behind the target, she added.\nThe legislative process for other potential laws, such as implementing climate-resilient forestry practices, tax breaks for electric company cars and stronger marine protection, barely made it out of the starting block, if at all. And the promised \"climate bonus\" \u2014 financial relief\u00a0to compensate for increases in the national CO2 price implemented in the heating and transport sectors \u2014 never made it to consumers.\nThat's because a constitutional court ruling last year\u00a0enforcing Germany's limits on debt left a gaping \u20ac60 billion chasm in the federal finances, forcing the coalition to cut or halt investments in climate and infrastructure initiatives.\nMeanwhile, German environmental NGO BUND is taking legal action against the Federal Climate Action Act \u2014 meant to be the foundation of the country's climate policy \u2014 because it says the law is insufficient.\nThe act, amended in summer 2023 after a long dispute, brings forward Germany's aim of being climate neutral to 2045 instead of 2050. The country also aims to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions by 65% instead of 55% this decade.\n\"Germany is absolutely not on a 1.5-degree path, because we have climate targets that do not do justice to the state of scientific knowledge,\" said Tina L\u00f6ffelsend, climate expert at BUND.\nTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video\nAn analysis by NGO Climate Action Tracker said the law weakens Germany's climate policies and will make it almost impossible to achieve net zero by 2045. The amendment abolished binding annual goals for emissions cuts in individual sectors like transport, building, energy and agriculture in favor of an overall target, according to the independent scientific project that tracks government climate policies.\nThe change takes pressure off individual ministries like transport and building, which consistently miss their emissions targets.\nBut Dirk Messner, head of Germany's Federal Environment Agency (UBA), is confident the country will meet its 2030 targets, even though \"we are not doing brilliantly in all sectors.\" Messner added in a statement that more needs to be done \u2014 particularly in the transport sector \u2014 to phase out climate-damaging subsidies.\nOne target the country will likely miss, according to analysts, is its 2030 goal of having 15 million electric cars on the road. Currently, the number is 2.3 million, including hybrid models. At the end of 2023, the coalition was forced to cancel subsidies for purchasing e-cars because of the budget deficit.\nExpansion of electric car charging infrastructure is also lagging, with Oliver Blume, CEO of beleaguered German carmaker Volkswagen Group, calling for renewed support in building out the network. German carmakers, which are playing catch-up in the e-car segment, are seeing falling vehicle sales, with Volkswagen planning thousands of layoffs.\nRenewable energy expansion is doing much better than e-mobility, according to Claudia Kemfert. \"Important framework conditions have been significantly improved in the solar energy and wind energy sectors,\" she said, although she also advocates for stronger climate action.\nThe share of green energy in the country's electricity mix is now over 60%, up from 43% in 2021. If Germany reaches its 80% by 2030 goal \"would be an important milestone in achieving the climate targets,\" added Kemfert.\nAt the same time, Russia's war in Ukraine has made it more difficult to implement climate policies set out in the coalition agreement, said Kemfert.\nAfter Russia's invasion in 2022, the country cut billions of cubic meters of pipeline gas supplies to Europe. Germany was particularly dependent on Russian gas. Energy prices skyrocketed, forcing the country to act quickly.\n\"It must be acknowledged that this [energy] crisis was handled well,\" said BUND climate analyst L\u00f6ffelsend.\nGermany built new liquefied natural gas (LNG terminals) in the North Sea and diversified its supply with gas from other countries. But this also created an overcapacity, \"which will cost us all dearly,\" said L\u00f6ffelsend.\u00a0Like coal and oil,\u00a0\u00a0LNG is a fossil fuel\u00a0and burning it drives planetary heating.\nTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video\nUBA's Messner told DW that concerns the outbreak of the war would see a \"coal and fossil fuel renaissance\" in Germany turned out to be unfounded. \"This is mainly due to the very successful expansion of renewable energies.\"\nLast year, German emissions fell around 10%, the sharpest decline since 1990. Still, that's not all down to climate policy. A sluggish economy and declines in production also played a role, said UBA.\nWith a political crisis at home to manage, Chancellor Olaf Scholz cancelled his attendance at the UN climate conference in Baku, Azerbaijan\u00a0last week. Negotiators at the summit are trying to hash out a new financing target for developing countries to cope with climate disasters and transform their energy systems. Rich and poor states are at odds over who should pay and how much.\nGermany is negotiating as part of the EU delegation and is still a strong partner despite domestic troubles, Jennifer Morgan, the country's special envoy for climate policy, told DW.\n\"We have a full mandate from the existing minority government,\" said Morgan last week in Baku, adding that Germany stands by its climate commitments.\nStill, Oxfam climate analyst Jan Kowalzig fears the prospect of an entirely new government in February and Germany's mixed climate record at home\u00a0could hold back partner countries from bolstering their own efforts. Germany has traditionally played a leading role in climate policy.\nTo keep global warming under 1.5 degrees Celsius , the limit agreed in Paris, states must collectively cut emissions 42% by the end of the decade. And the world is currently a long way off that target.\nThis article was originally written in German.",

            "content": "Tesla CEO Elon Musk has called on the people of Germany to \"say no\" to German Chancellor Olaf Scholz. His statement comes after Germany's ruling Social Democrats (SPD) on Saturday announced Scholz as the party's candidate for federal elections set to take place on December 23.\nMusk made the statement on X in response to two news reports -- one about SPD nominating Scholz for German Chancellor again and another June 24 report that said that a woman convicted of \"offending\" migrant gang rapists receives longer prison sentences than the rapists.\nIn response to the two posts shared on X, Elon Musk wrote, \"Sag Nein zu Scholz!\" which translates to \"Say No to Scholz\" in English.\nThe snap elections for a new parliament in Germany are set to take place on February 23 as Scholz lost a confidence vote in the parliament in December.\nMusk has publicly expressed support for the Alternative for Germany (AfD) party ahead of the snap election in Germany. Earlier on January 9, Musk called Germany's Alternative for Germany (AfD) co-leader Alice Weidel \"very reasonable,\" calling on Germans to vote for the far-right party, CNN reported.\nDuring an audio livestream alongside AfD co-leader Weidel on X, Musk said, \"Only AfD can save Germany, end of story, and people really need to get behind AfD, and otherwise things are going to get very, very much worse in Germany.\"\nHe compared the political climate in Germany to that of the US, stressing that people were unhappy and wanted a change when voting for Trump in November, according to CNN report. Tesla CEO said, \"If you are unhappy with the situation, you must vote for change, and that is why I'm really strongly recommending that people vote for AfD.\"\nWeidel said that it was \"unbelievable\" how Germany treated Trump while he campaigned to become US President, saying that it caused her \"physical pain\" to see him \"disparaged.\"\nDuring the same conversation, Alice Weidel stated that Germany needs to portect the existence of Israel and to \"take our responsibility as a German nation state to protect Jewish life,\" which she said was threatened by \"Muslim crime.\" She called AfD the \"only protector of the Jewish people\" in Germany, CNN report.\nOn December 20, Musk on X wrote, \"Only the AfD can save Germany.\" He made the statement after the German government collapsed, prompting Weidel to respond at the time, \"Yes! You are perfectly right!\"\nMusk has called German President Frank-Walter Steinmeier \"an anti-democratic tyrant\" after he made remarks against foreign interference during his speech on the dissolution of Germany's parliament. He demanded Scholz's resignation following a car-ramming attack in Magdeburg, calling him an \"incompetent fool\" in a post on X.\nAfter Elon Musk endorsed AfD, the German government accused Elon Musk of interfering in the country's upcoming election, Euro News reported. Officials, including government spokesperson Christiane Hoffmann, Social Democratic Party (SPD) co-leader Lars Klingbeil, and Friedrich Merz, leader of Germany's largest opposition party Christian Democratic Union (CDU) condemned Musk's statement in Germany.\n\"It is indeed the case that Elon Musk is trying to influence the federal election through his statements,\" Hoffmann said.\nShe added that although Musk was \"free to express his opinion\" it was worth noting Musk was recommending voting for a party that is \"being monitored by the Office for the Protection of the Constitution on suspicion of being right-wing extremist and that has already been recognized as being right-wing extremist in parts.\"\nSPD co-leader Lars Klingbeil also criticised Musk, comparing him to Russian President Vladimir Putin and accusing him of election interference. In an interview with Funke Mediengruppe on Monday, Klingbeil likened Musk to Putin, saying that \"both want to influence our elections and are deliberately supporting the AfD, the enemies of democracy. They want Germany to be weakened and plunge into chaos.\"\n\"We need to be much more proactive and effectively limit the power of the large internet platforms like Musk's short message service, X. Here, a tech billionaire is trying to use his influence to influence the course of world politics,\" Euro News reported.\nCDU leader Friedrich Merz called Musk's endorsement of the far-right AfD an unprecedented example of meddling between allied nations and highlighted the potential economic harm of AfD policies, such as their push for Germany to exit the European Union.\n(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)\nTrack Latest News Live on NDTV.com and get news updates from India  and around the world",

            "content": "With rising poll numbers and renewed purpose, the socialist Left Party presented a united front at its convention this weekend. But will it be enough to make it back into the Bundestag?\nA new \"spirit of optimism\"\u00a0came up repeatedly in speeches at the Left Party's convention in Berlin on Saturday. Just a few months ago, there was no such outlook.\nLast year was a political nightmare for the party: In January,\u00a0their former parliamentary group leader Sahra Wagenknecht founded her own eponymous party, then they saw their European Union representation cut in half to just 2.7%. The 2024 state elections were also a disaster, with the party losing its traditional foothold in the east. Their only state premier failed to hang on in Thuringia, while they barely made it into Saxony's state parliament and were kicked out of Brandenburg entirely.\nSo it was little wonder that few believed that the Left Party, known as Die Linke in German, would have much success in the upcoming parliamentary elections on February 23.\nBut the tide seems to be turning: In polls the Left Party is approaching the 5% hurdle needed to enter the Bundestag as the renegade Sahra Wagenknecht Alliance (BSW) loses support. The shift is likely due to a change in party leadership, with Jan van Aken and Ines Schwerdtner replacing Janine Wissler and Martin Schirdewan, who were unable to halt the party's steady loss in support.\nThe duo, who were elected in October, had barely taken office when Chancellor Olaf Scholz's governing coalition collapsed the next month, forcing a vote of no confidence that saw him call for an early election. Without their now estranged coalition partner, the neoliberal Free Democrats (FDP), Scholz's center-left Social Democratic Party (SPD) and the environmentalist Green Party\u00a0can no longer form a majority in the Bundestag.\nIn the wake of the government collapse, the Left Party quickly presented an election program focused on social and economic policy, which has now been adopted at the party conference. They accuse the SPD and Greens of having done nothing to combat the mounting affordability crisis in recent years. \"People realize that the Left Party is credibly fighting for social issues, that no one else is doing it, that we are the only ones taking on the rich,\"\u00a0party co-leader Ines Schwerdtner told DW.\nTo reduce\u00a0poverty, she has proposed abolishing value-added tax on basic foodstuffs, hygiene products and public transport tickets. Currently, up to 19%\u00a0VAT is charged on these items\u2014almost a fifth of their total price.\nTo finance these plans, the party wants to increase state revenue with a graduated wealth tax: 1%\u00a0for people in possession of \u20ac1 million, 5% from \u20ac50 million and 12%\u00a0from \u20ac1 billion.\n\"Millions of hard-working people have created this extreme wealth,\"\u00a0party co-leader Jan van Aken told the party conference. \"We have to get it back so that we can all live well again.\"\u00a0There is enough money to go around, it is just being misallocated, he added.\nTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video\nTo allow Germany to borrow more again, the Left Party also wants to reform the debt brake enshrined in the constitution. This would enable the modernization of crumbling infrastructure with an additional \u20ac200 billion. Financially ailing companies would also receive state support in exchange for long-term job guarantees and collective agreements, in addition to agreeing to keep their locations in Germany.\nThe party also described the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) as its main opponent in the Bundestag elections. \"Not an inch for the fascists,\"\u00a0van Aken said, highlighting how\u00a0many left-wingers turned up in Riesa to demonstrate against the AfD party conference last week. \"We on the left always oppose attempts to divide our society and incitement against migrants,\"\u00a0van Aken said.\nA former United Nations biological weapons inspector, van Aken also addressed Russia's war of aggression against Ukraine as a violation of international law: \"We on the left are against all war and stand for peace,\"\u00a0he said, but made a distinction between militarization and other potential routes to end the conflict. \"We need more diplomacy in Ukraine, not more weapons,\"\u00a0he said. \"Without freedom and democracy in Ukraine, there will be no peace.\"\nParty patriarch Gregor Gysi received an enthusiastic reception at the conference. The Berliner just celebrated his 77th birthday last week and is once again running for a direct mandate, having won his constituency eight times already. Together with two other prominent Left Party elders, he has launched Mission Silberlocke (\"Mission Silver Locks\").\nTheir aim: to secure the Left Party's re-entry to the Bundestag even if it fails to reach the 5%\u00a0hurdle by seizing on a detail of German electoral law, by which a party may still enter parliament with at least three direct mandates. The party already benefited from this rule in the 2021 Bundestag elections.\nGysi has no doubts about defending his mandate and hopes for a result of at least 5% for the party. Co-chair Ines Schwerdtner is also confident, despite the loss of many voters to the BSW following Sahra Wagenknecht's departure. \"We want to win back all the voters who once voted for the Left Party,\"\u00a0Schwerdtner told DW.\nAfter years of internal disputes, the party is once again united and fighting for the same electoral goal. And Gysi also has a personal goal: If voters choose him once again, he would likely be the longest-serving member of the Bundestag\u2014racking up 32 years, save for a brief interruption. His dream is to open the first session of the next German Bundestag with a speech as the Alterspr\u00e4sident (president by seniority), a tradition that comes with freedom from both content and time limits.\nThis article was originally published in German.",

            "content": "The Left Party has dramatically lost voter support. But for the general election in February, a trio of seniors is coming to the rescue \u2014 banking on a quirk in German electoral law.\nGermany's Left Party is struggling for survival. For many weeks, opinion polls have put them well below the 5% threshold for representation in parliament.\nNow, three of the party's most senior and most popular politicians have decided to make sure their party is represented no matter how poor the overall performance.\nOn February 23, 2025, Germany is set to hold a snap election. Germans have two votes: one for\u00a0a candidate in their constituency, the other\u00a0for a party. This second vote determines the number of seats a party gets in the Bundestag. Any party that scores less than 5% fails to get representation.\nHowever, an exception exists: If\u00a0three party candidates win in their respective constituencies, the 5% threshold is waived.\nThis exception in electoral law came to the Left Party's aid in the 2021 federal election when it garnered only 4.9% of the vote.\nHowever, because three Left Party candidates won their constituencies, the Left was allowed to fill 4.9% of the seats in parliament and send a total of 39 MPs.\nThe Left Party hopes to pull off this rare feat once again in 2025.\nTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video\nHowever, this is likely to be even more difficult this time around, as the party will likely lose many voters to the\u00a0left-wing populist\u00a0Sahra Wagenknecht Alliance (BSW), which split off from the Left Party in early 2024 and has since performed significantly better in regional elections and opinion polls.\nGregor Gysi, Bodo Ramelow\u00a0and Dietmar Bartsch, all well past retirement age, may now be the best hope for a party that dates back to the communist German Democratic Republic,\u00a0and is now more worried about its future than ever before.\nThey call their renewed candidacy for the Bundestag \"Mission Silver Locks\" \u2014 an ironic reference to their average age of\u00a070.\nThe most prominent among them is Gregor Gysi, who is turning\u00a077 years old in January. He played a pivotal role in the successful transformation of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany (SED) in East Germany, helping it to become\u00a0the Left Party as it is today.\nGysi, a former lawyer and eloquent orator, has been a member of the German Bundestag almost continuously since 1990, winning his Berlin constituency eight times by a wide margin.\nGysi believes he and his party continue to be a much-needed voice in reunified Germany.\u00a0\"If arguments from the left are no longer heard\u00a0in the Bundestag, debates\u00a0will become a lot more limited,\" he said, adding that the Left Party was still the voice of eastern German voters\u00a0more than any other party.\nThis view is also shared by Dietmar Bartsch, Gysi's decadeslong comrade and confidant. The 66-year-old comes from the northeastern region of\u00a0Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania, where the Left Party has been part of the state government since 2021 in coalition with the center-left Social Democratic Party (SPD).\nBartsch has said there is only one left-wing party in the Bundestag:\u00a0the Left Party. \"All the others tend to jockey for the center,\" he\u00a0said.\nBartsch, who holds a doctorate in economics, has been a member of the Bundestag since 1998 with only a brief interruption. He has also served as the parliamentary group\u00a0leader and, as managing director of the Left Party, has organized numerous electoral campaigns.\nUnlike Gysi, however, Bartsch has never won his constituency and got into parliament only via\u00a0his party's state list. A victory in his constituency would, therefore, be a first.\nThe third of the three most promising Left Party candidates\u00a0is Bodo Ramelow, the head of government in\u00a0the eastern state of Thuringia.\nRamelow,\u00a068, recently lost in his state's election but remains very popular. If he wins his constituency for the Left Party in the Bundestag election, it would come as no surprise.\nRamelow was a member of the Bundestag from 2005 to 2009. Now, together with Gysi and Bartsch, he wants to help his badly shaken party back into the Bundestag.\nThe Left Party's membership has an average age of 55, and only one-third of them are women. Critics have suggested that rather than banking on elderly candidates to lead the party into the future, it should embrace diversity and focus on\u00a0the younger generation in the big cities.\nThis article was originally written in German.\nWhile you're here: Every Tuesday, DW editors round up what is happening in German politics and society.

We must become even more resilient and competitive, and we have what it takes.\"As a community of more than 450 million Europeans, we have economic weight... Germany is the third-largest economy in the world.\"While seeking to reach out to Trump, Scholz condemned the stance of the president's billionaire ally Elon Musk, who has strongly backed the far-right Alternative for Germany party.Scholz criticised Musk's support for \"extreme-right positions\", a day after the tech mogul sparked criticism with a gesture some likened to a Nazi salute. \"We have freedom of speech in Europe and in Germany,\" said Scholz when asked about the X, SpaceX and Tesla chief, who made the gesture at an event marking Trump's inauguration. \"Everyone can say what he wants, even if he is a billionaire,\" said Scholz. \"What we do not accept is if this is supporting extreme right positions.\"Musk, who has previously insulted Scholz on X, replied almost immediately with another expletive on his social media platform.\u00a9 Agence France-PresseTrump News",

The association demands that the new government in Berlin and the EU Commission in Brussels must do everything to \"restore Germany to a leading global position.\"\nTo achieve this, the auto industry lobby group wants \"affordable energy, less regulation and bureaucracy, as well as a competitive tax system.\"\nIfW economist Dirk Dohse believes, however, that the EU's climate target of becoming carbon-neutral by 2045 is \"leaving the German government with limited influence\" at least as far as energy policy is concerned.\nAdditionally, Dohse says German carmakers themselves bore some responsibility for the current crisis. \"Necessary structural adjustments were delayed for too long, leading to sharply reduced profit margins. German companies took far too long to partner with strong software companies,\" he told DW. As a result, he said, auto companies \"do not have a true 'breakthrough' product in the electric car market.\"\nDohse also emphasizes the urgency of \"expanding charging infrastructure and providing planning security for EV buyers.\"\nWhile debates about the value of subsidies for electric cars will continue, he insisted that rules governing access to chargers and billing should be \"clear, transparent, and valid for a predetermined period.\" All policy measures regarding EVs must be reliable, and \"avoiding abrupt changes based on budget constraints.\"\nJ\u00fcrgen Pieper also advocates for a \"consistent strategy for new technologies.\" At the same time, he warned against overregulation and demanded \"technological openness\" where policymakers should set \"precise, quantifiable [emission] goals while leaving the path to achieving them to the industry.\"\nThe relationship between the German auto industry and politics has always been deeply intertwined at various levels of political decision-making. Regional governments have played a significant role in ensuring that the industry enjoys favorable conditions, while carmakers guaranteed well-paid jobs for voters.\nIn the regional state of Lower Saxony, home to Volkswagen (VW), for example, the government holds a seat on the VW board giving it massive influence over company policy. Similarly, in the state of Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg, currently ruled by a Green party state premier, or in Bavaria, where the conservative Christian Social Union (CSU) wields enormous influence in premium carmakers BMW and Audi.\nExperts say the cozy relationship between business and politics has not always been to the benefit of the auto industry because any change of government can significantly impact company policy. Automakers cannot afford to ignore political developments and must maintain relationships across the political spectrum to safeguard their interests regardless of election results.\nAt the moment, however, one of the biggest threats to German carmakers' business prospects has emerged across the Atlantic, in the shape of the new US President,\u00a0Donald Trump.\nTrump has threatened carmakers from around the world, notably those in China and Germany, with a massive hike in import tariffs, urging them to produce in the US instead.\nJ\u00fcrgen Pieper says \"Given the economic crisis and expected pressure from the Trump administration, the new German government may try to ease the burden on the auto industry.\" This could include postponing an EU ban on sales of combustion engine cars by 2035 and reintroducing purchase incentives for electric and hybrid cars, he told DW.\nBut the measures taken by the next German government, Pieper added, are as unpredictable as the makeup of the government itself, which pollsters say could be led by the conservative Christian Democratic Union (CDU), either with the environmentalist Greens or the Social Democratic SPD.\n\"It's highly likely the planned 2035 phase-out of combustion engine cars may be pushed back to 2040. But in a coalition with the Greens that is less likely.\"\nThis article was originally written in German.",

Major automakers like Volkswagen plan to cut thousands of jobs due to these challenges. Experts attribute the crisis to a mix of management issues, sudden policy changes regarding EV subsidies, and increased competition from Chinese manufacturers. As the industry shifts towards electric vehicles, there is concern over Germany's ability to compete globally. Calls for political action and innovation are crucial for recovery, with 2025 seen as a pivotal year for the industry's future.",
            "content": "The German auto industry was in crisis mode last year, amid stuttering sales of electric vehicles in Europe and falling demand for fossil-fuel-driven cars in China. Will it survive another year in the doldrums?\nGoing into 2025, the German economy remains stuck in recession, with a\u00a0crisis\u00a0in the country's all-important automotive industry significantly contributing to the downturn.\nEurope's biggest carmaker, Volkswagen (VW), for instance, is planning to cut thousands of jobs in Germany\u00a0over the next few years.Mass layoffs are also on the horizon at other German automakers, affecting many of the industry's multiple suppliers.\nThe current state of affairs in the German car industry is plain to see for everyone, but opinions diverge when it comes to identifying the causes of the crisis.\nIndustry expert Stefan Bratzel from the Center of Automotive Management describes the situation as a \"combination of difficulties,\" calling\u00a0the problems a \"German polycrisis.\"\nHe told DW that the industry is \"still learning new skills in the transformation toward e-mobility, software-based vehicles\u00a0and autonomous driving.\" Additionally, Bratzel said\u00a0a \"new competitive environment\" has emerged in the industry, with challenges\u00a0\"not limited to [US electric-vehicle pioneer] Tesla and new Chinese manufacturers.\"\nA spokesperson for the German Association of the Automotive Industry (VDA) laid part of the blame for the difficulties on\u00a0policymakers, telling DW that the sudden termination of electric-vehicle (EV) subsidies in December 2023 by the government of Chancellor Olaf Scholz\u00a0and an insufficient charging infrastructure in Germany were \"dampening sales figures and contributed to the overall situation.\"\nFerdinand Dudenh\u00f6ffer from the Center for Automotive Research\u00a0think tank shares this view, criticizing politicians for sending conflicting signals.\u00a0\"One moment, they want electric cars, and the next, they're promoting combustion engines, which confuses people,\" he told DW.\nFor quite a few years now, it has been clear that the future of the automobile\u00a0lies outside the traditional internal combustion engine, no matter whether fueled by fossil fuels or synthetic alternatives. The trend in the industry is moving decisively toward electrically driven cars.\nFrank Schwope, who teaches automotive economics at the University of Applied Sciences for Small and Medium Enterprises in Germany, sees \"serious management errors at some manufacturers.\" He said executives have buried their heads in the sand, hoping \"everything would work out fine.\"\nBut it hasn't, said Bratzel, and\u00a0the German car industry has fallen behind in the global competition \"due to high labor costs, including health care expenses and extensive vacation days.\" These privileges for German workforces \"worked as long as Germany was better and more innovative than others,\" he said.\nTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video\nBratzel has identified a critical shortfall: While German automakers excel in building conventional cars, they lag behind in making\u00a0EVs, as these\u00a0require automotive software and electronic components rather than mechanical parts.\n\"The erosion of old paradigms and knowledge is truly tragic,\" he said.\nDirk Dohse from the Kiel Institute for the World Economy (IfW)\u00a0believes German developers and engineers are \"still among the global elite.\" Nevertheless, he told DW, there is a \"lack of flexibility, particularly in management, to attract new customer groups, such as tech-savvy young people in Asia.\"\nDohse sees China clearly leading Germany not only in EV technology but also with regard to market power. \"The Chinese EV market is the largest and most dynamic globally, which suggests China will continue to pull ahead,\" he said.\nChina's huge technological advances and a dramatic shift in Chinese customer\u00a0preferences have created massive problems for Germany's big three automakers VW, BMW and Mercedes, who had long dominated the Chinese car market with their combustion engine vehicles.\nBut there are even new rivals competing against the Germans for market share, said Bratzel.\n\"It's not just China. In the medium term, stronger players will also emerge in India, modeled after Chinese manufacturers. Many companies from China and Korea are likely to enter India, possibly through joint ventures,\" he said.\nFor Frank Schwope, German automakers can still see some hope in the development of state-of-the-art batteries, a key component of EVs at the moment and in the future.\n\"Batteries for electric vehicles are far from mature. Significant advances are possible, and by the end of the decade, we could see a shift toward solid-state batteries, which could change the game,\" he said.\nStefan Bratzel believes 2025 will be a decisive year for the German auto industry's efforts to catch up with global developments \u2014 not only in terms of\u00a0regulatory improvements but also in terms of creative and courageous action on the part of management. \"Germany must be at least as innovative as it is expensive,\" he said.\nWhat's at stake wasvividly illustrated by a recent study conducted by the Swiss-based Prognos Institute on behalf of the VDA industry group. If the current EV trend continues, the study said, about 186,000 fewer carmaking jobs will exist in Germany by 2035 compared to 2019.\nBetween 2019 and 2023, the industry already lost some 46,000 jobs, the VDA spokesperson quoted from the study, with \"another 140,000 likely to disappear by 2035.\"\nAs a result, said the spokesperson, VDA is calling for swift political action that must include \"less bureaucracy, more trade agreements, a competitive tax system, as well as simpler and faster approval processes.\"\nEven if policymakers create more favorable conditions and German carmakers regain\u00a0competitiveness, the industry's recovery will take time, cautioned\u00a0Bratzel.\n\"The next two to three years will be a major challenge, requiring the simultaneous tackling of many structural problems,\" he said, adding on a brighter note: \"At least politics has now recognized Germany's 'polycrisis.'\"\nIfW's Dohse, by contrast, predicts the situation may worsen before improving. \"I think 2025 will be a very tough year for the German auto industry, and it will also be a year when setting the right course for the future will be essential,\" he said.\nFor Dudenh\u00f6ffer, much will depend on how markets in the United States and China develop. \"It's of utmost importance for the industry to be present in dynamic markets. This can be China to some degree, but also the US, where Donald Trump has yet to decide, however, if he wants to go back to the 1980s era of the combustion engine,\" he said of the US president-elect.\nSchwope thinks there's a glimmer of hope for German carmakers, as he expects currently sluggish EV sales in Germany and Europe to \"gain significant momentum by 2025, or in 2026 at the latest.\"\nThis article was originally written in German.",

He is suspected of having attacked a kindergarten group in a park in the Bavarian city of Aschaffenburg, killing a 2-year-old Moroccan boy as well as a 41-year-old passerby who had attempted to intervene. Three others were wounded, including a 2-year-old Syrian girl.\nA court on Thursday ordered the suspect to be temporarily placed in a psychiatric hospital.\nThe attack came just one month after a deadly car-ramming attack in the eastern city of Magdeburg and six months after similar knife attacks in the western cities of Solingen and Mannheim.\nAnd with just one month to go until Germany's federal elections, the incident has further enflamed an already heated immigration debate in the country.\nTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video\nFriedrich Merz, leader of the center-right opposition Christian Democrats (CDU) and favorite to become Germany's next chancellor, vowed on Thursday to order permanent controls at all German borders on the first day of his term in office, if elected.\n\"We are faced with the ruins of a 10-year-long misguided asylum and immigration policy in Germany,\" he told reporters, criticizing European Union migration rules as \"dysfunctional\" and insisting all \"illegal immigrants\" should be turned away at the border, including those seeking protection.\n\"There will be a de facto ban on entry into the Federal Republic of Germany for all those who do not have valid entry documents,\" he said.\nMerz's suggestion received support from the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) party, currently polling second behind the CDU.\nIn a social media post, AfD co-chairwoman and chancellor candidate Alice Weidel called for \"border closures and the deportation of illegal [immigrants]\" and demanded \"no more firewall deaths.\"\nWith that, she was referring to the conventional refusal of Germany's other parties to enter into coalitions with the AfD, known as the Brandmauer, or firewall.\nMerz has also ruled out forming a government with the AfD, that's a step the\u00a0neoliberal Free Democrats (FDP)\u00a0hopes will bring it back into the government. Traditionally, the FDP has been a natural coalition partner for the CDU and its Bavarian sister party, the Christian Social Union. Demands from the FDP were at the heart of what broke up a three-party coalition government in November, prompting February's snap election.\n\"Merz is calling for a radical change, of course,\" FDP leader Christian Lindner\u00a0wrote on social media. \"But he won't be able to do that with the [ruling SPD] or [the Greens].\"\nOn the other side of the political spectrum, Sahra Wagenknecht of the self-titled, left-wing, migration-sceptic, populist\u00a0\u00a0Sahra Wagenknecht Alliance (BSW) also called for a \"real U-turn in refugee policy.\" She\u00a0told Welt TV that the authorities had \"lost control\" over those traveling to Germany.\nWhile opposition parties tried to position themselves as the best potential candidates for a post-election coalition with the CDU, the country's governing parties have also been apportioning blame, as have the relevant security authorities, at Bavarian state leaders, especially since the Aschaffenburg suspect was already subject to a deportation order.\n\"There are clearly enforcement deficits, especially within the Bavarian authorities in this case, which are a massive problem,\" Chancellor Olaf Scholz said at a Social Democrat (SPD) campaign event in the eastern German city of Erfurt. He insisted that his federal government had taken measures to facilitate deportations.\nFederal Interior Minister Nancy Faeser, also of Scholz's SPD, pointed out that deportations were the responsibility of Germany's 16 states and said Bavarian authorities needed to \"explain why the attacker was still at large despite [having committed] several violent crimes.\"\n\"The continuing investigation must quickly show why this criminal was still in Germany and how the police and justice system on the ground have been dealing with him,\" Faeser said. \"The rule of law must show strength, and that includes authorities, police and courts.\"\nHowever, the state of\u00a0Bavaria's interior minister, Joachim Herrmann of CSU, blamed Berlin and accused the Federal Office for Migration and Refugees (BAMF) of \"failure.\"\nAccording to Herrmann, the suspect should have been deported to Bulgaria in the summer of 2023, but the relevant order was issued to the Bavarian authorities several weeks too late, by which point the legal deadline to enforce the deportation had expired.\nHerrmann claimed it then took until December 2024 for BAMF to process the man's asylum application.\n\"The responsibility lies solely with BAMF,\" he said, calling on Scholz to \"concern himself with his own [federal] authorities.\"\nBavarian Premier Markus S\u00f6der (CSU) also looked to absolve his state's authorities of blame.\n\"That's enough, that's enough, that's enough,\" said S\u00f6der said in Munich. \"How many more? Mannheim, Solingen, Magdeburg, Aschaffenburg. What's next?\"\nHe also pointed his finger at the federal government,\u00a0\"These aren't coincidences but the result of a chain of bad immigration policies over years.\"\n\"Immigration is overwhelming our country,\" he added, agreeing with Merz that\u00a0\"the guidelines of any future immigration policy must be zero-tolerance and no compromises.\"\nVice-Chancellor and Economy Minister Robert Habeck called for a \"self-critical\" evaluation within Germany's administrative bodies.\n\"Self-critical doesn't mean that every department says: 'Well, we did everything right,'\" the Green Party's chancellor candidate said. \"Because clearly something went wrong. This perpetrator should have either been deported or at least checked up on and perhaps detained.

Legal and coalition complexities may hinder the implementation of these proposals, with other parties deeming them excessive.",
            "content": "Ahead of Germany's election in February, Bavaria's conservative CSU party has said it will only accept migrants who pay their own way. Experts see their policy proposals as electioneering and potentially illegal.\nThe center-right Christian Social Union (CSU) exists as a political party only in Germany's southern state of Bavaria. Its political agenda is more or less the same as that of the\u00a0Christian Democratic Union (CDU), which is politically active in the other 15\u00a0German states.\nFor this reason, the CSU is often called a \"sister party\" to the CDU, and the two have been allied in\u00a0a parliamentary group in the German Bundestag for decades.\nAt the snap federal election to be held on February 23, this group, known in Germany as \"the Union,\" aims to replace\u00a0the center-left\u00a0Social Democratic Party (SPD), which had been leading the country's coalition government until its collapse\u00a0last month.\nAnd it has a good chance\u00a0of success: The respected Deutschlandtrend opinion poll for December showed the Union with 32% voter popularity \u2014\u00a0double that of the SPD, and with all other parties\u00a0lagging well behind.\nOne prominent election issue is migration, which has been the subject of heated debate in Germany in recent years. The deadly attack on a Christmas market in the eastern city of Magdeburg shortly before Christmas Eve has caused the tone of this debate to take on even sharper contours.\nAlthough he had been in Germany since 2006, had permanent residency and worked as a doctor, the alleged attacker originally came from Saudi Arabia. All of this has led all parties, with the exception of the Left Party, to call for stricter regulation of migration.\nIn recent days, Bavarian media have reported on some of the CSU's\u00a0particularly strict ideas when it comes to migration, quoting from\u00a0a position paper drawn up for a CSU conference\u00a0to be held\u00a0January 6 to\u00a08:\n\"People wanting to live with us long-term\u00a0must also work long-term and not claim benefits long-term,\" the paper says.\nThis CSU demand\u00a0goes beyond what the party previously agreed with the CDU in a joint manifesto for the general election. The latter states that \"[on] the whole, non-cash benefits should take precedence over cash benefits wherever possible. The debit card\u00a0should be introduced universally and strictly in all German states.\"\nLaw professor\u00a0Volker Boehme-Nessler, who teaches at\u00a0Oldenburg University in northern Germany, views this CSU proposal as unrealistic.\n\"Anyone living here legally as a refugee cannot have their means of existence taken from them,\" he told the private TV broadcaster, Welt, on Thursday, citing German and European law.\nAnd any potential change, he said, was complicated\u00a0because a decisive issue was at stake.\u00a0\"Is someone being persecuted? Is someone in need of protection?\" he said.\nBoehme-Nessler believes another demand from the CSU position paper might have a better chance of success, the one that says that anyone committing a crime or who commits multiple offenses should leave the country.\nThis is already possible, and existing laws on this are quite tough.\u00a0\"We could deport more, but deportations don't work,\" he said.\nIf the CSU had its way, there would be more of a focus on deportations. The party has called\u00a0for migrants who do not leave or cannot be deported to be put into pre-removal\u00a0custody for indefinite periods.\nBoehme-Nessler said such ideas were populist. \"This is just about election campaigning,\" he said, referring to the fact that migration is fairly high on the list of concerns of German voters. \"But seen from a legal and humanitarian point of view, it is problematic.\"\nTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video\nVolker Kronenberg, a political science professor at Bonn University, also sees the CSU's position paper as pre-election posturing. The CSU is trying to steal thunder from\u00a0the far-right\u00a0Alternative for Germany (AfD) party, which has increased its appeal by taking more extremist positions on\u00a0migration, asylum policy and domestic security.\nKronenberg doesn't see too many differences between the CSU and the CDU on this issue, though. The basics of policy put forward by the CDU-CSU candidate for chancellor, Friedrich Merz, is already a departure from the migration policy of former CDU leader Angela Merkel, who was chancellor until 2021.\nMerkel is perceived as being responsible for the entry of almost a million refugees, mostly from Syria, in 2015, when the former chancellor, confronted with a looming humanitarian crisis on Europe's borders, assured Germans that\u00a0\"we can do this!\"\nEven back then, the CSU disagreed with the government's approach.\u00a0Horst Seehofer, the former Bavarian premier and a CSU member, described Merkel's asylum policy as a \"reign of injustice.\"\nSeehofer wasn't the only one, though, with Kronenberg highlighting the way other German political parties have acted during\u00a0the ensuing years.\nSpeaking to the TV broadcaster Welt,\u00a0Kronenberg gave the example of\u00a0Germany's current Chancellor Olaf Scholz, a member of the center-left Social Democrats. In October 2023, Scholz\u00a0appeared on the front\u00a0page of news magazine Der Spiegel\u00a0with a quote from his interview: \"We must start deporting on a massive scale!\"\nBut such statements have not come to much, Kronenberg said, citing how few deportations had been carried out since then. Often, deportations fail simply because the countries of origin refuse to take back their citizens\u00a0or the German government is not officially in contact with them, as was the case with Syria until recently.\nAccording to Kronenberg, there's a lot of talk but very few, real political consequences. \"And that increases frustration and discontent,\" he said, leading anti-immigration voters to turn\u00a0to parties like the AfD or the far-left\u00a0Sahra Wagenknecht Alliance (BSW).\nThe BSW is an offshoot of the Left Party, with which it still has much in common\u00a0except on the issue of\u00a0migration. The BSW belongs to the camp calling for harsher regulation, along with the AfD and now the CSU.\nTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video\nThe CSU's policy proposals are likely to remain just that \u2014 proposals \u2014 after February's federal election.\nFor one thing, there are the legal concerns. But there's also another reason:\u00a0any government led by the CDU-CSU bloc would still need a further coalition partner, and the SPD or the Greens\u00a0are the most likely contenders.\nAlthough both of these parties are also in favor of stricter regulation, they believe the\u00a0CSU's ideas go too far. As\u00a0SPD politician Dirk Wiese told the daily Rheinische Post recently, \"the CSU has once more far overshot the mark and is simply currying favor with the AfD.\"\nThis article was originally written in German.\nWhile you're here: Every Tuesday, DW editors round up what is happening in German politics and society.

Friedrich Merz has to win over trust if he wants to be chancellor, and he has a lot of work ahead of him.\u201d\nSuch public criticisms from within the CDU are unusual, particularly in election season, and reflect lingering doubts about Merz as leader.\nMerz, a 69-year-old millionaire investment banker and one-time rival of Angela Merkel, returned to politics after her departure but secured the CDU leadership only on his third attempt.\nDespite leading in polls, Germany\u2019s snap election has robbed Merz of a crucial six months to position himself as chancellor-in-waiting. To jump-start that process, he visited the grave of the CDU\u2019s first leader, Konrad Adenauer, this week and delivered a keynote address in the fabled Petersberg government guest house above the Rhine, near Bonn.\n\u201cThe 2025 election is a direction-setting poll, almost like 1949 again in terms of fundamental future political decisions,\u201d said Merz in a 35-minute speech that was light on detail but heavy on the obvious \u2013 \u201cWe are in a time of change\u201d \u2013 and pathos: \u201cThe history of this country doesn\u2019t write itself, it is written.\u201d\n[\u00a0Germany awaits political duel between Scholz and MerzOpens in new window\u00a0]\nBut by whom? The CDU leader\u2019s more populist Bavarian ally, the Christian Social Union (CSU), is piling pressure on Merz to rule out a post-election alliance with the Greens.\nThe CSU is polling steadily on 14-15 per cent and is largely unscathed from its alliance with Scholz, but remains a neuralgic point for many conservative voters who see the party as ideologically extreme.\nAnother challenge it faces is the surge of the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) to second place in polls, in one just nine points behind the CDU.\nIn a live-stream on Thursday on his Twitter/X platform, billionaire Elon Musk urged German voters to back the AfD, \u201cor things are going to get much worse for Germany\u201d.\nMerz has ruled out any co-operation with the AfD, but critics see its popularity behind a rightward drift of CDU policies.\nFor instance Merz has courted controversy for suggesting that dual citizens who commit a crime in Germany should lose their German passport \u2013 reviving memories of how Nazi Germany stripped tens of thousands of Germans of their citizenship.\nCentre-left Social Democratic Party (SPD) strategists have pounced on the passport remark as the first \u2013 and, for them, hopefully not the last \u2013 Merz gaffe of the campaign.\n\u201cIn my opinion, this is another very dangerous populist statement,\u201d said Matthias Miersch, SPD general secretary. \u201cCitizenship is something you can\u2019t play with.\u201d\nGermany\u2019s outgoing ruling party has an uphill battle ahead. It lies in third place in the polls with 14-16 per cent support \u2013 half that of the CDU/CSU and some 10 points behind its 2021 winning result.\nThe SPD hopes to win back voters with the promise of guarantees on bread-and-butter issues: pensions, growth and take-home pay rather than tax giveaways for top earners and companies.\nThe SPD\u2019s plan to revive the economy will be cheaper and more effective, it says, with tax write-offs for companies that invest \u2013 or manufacture \u2013 more in Germany.\n\u201cIf we want to maintain our performance for the future, then the right course must be set now,\u201d said Scholz, hoping for a second term as SPD chancellor.\nDespite the short election campaign, a host of variables and unknowns make it difficult to predict the outcome. The fate of the liberal Free Democratic Party (FDP) remains unclear, while the populist vote could be split between the AfD and the new left-conservative BSW alliance.\nThe latter\u2019s pacifist campaign platform could lose relevance with any ceasefire in the Ukraine-Russia war.\nFor long-time Berlin watchers, the most likely electoral outcome is a return to the Merkel era with another CDU-SPD grand coalition.\n\u201cThere\u2019s no game changer in the Merz plan and no major political shift for the CDU is likely,\u201d said Gero Neugebauer, a Berlin-based political scientist. \u201cThat means the SPD remains its closest political ally.\u201d\n\u00a9 2025 The Irish Times DAC",

Merz criticized previous policies and promised to enact laws to prevent illegal entries, even if they conflict with European asylum rules. The incident has sparked political blame and discussions about the safety and effectiveness of current asylum policies.",
            "content": "German chancellor hopeful Friedrich Merz has promised a swift crackdown on immigration if elected next month, responding to a stabbing attack in which two people were killed, including a two-year-old child.\nIn the attack on Wednesday a man entered a playground in the Bavarian city of Aschaffenburg and fatally stabbed the toddler,   as well a 41-year-old passerby who tried to intervene. A 28-year-old man from Afghanistan, who had made a failed application for asylum, was arrested following the incident.\nAdditional passersby who intervened were seriously injured in the attack and are receiving medical treatment.\nWith his remarks Mr Merz, leader of the opposition Christian Democratic Union (CDU), signalled a radical shift away from a more open migration policy pursued by his party predecessor, Angela Merkel.\n\u201cWe see before us the ruins of 10 years of misguided asylum and immigration policy in Germany, we are at the limit,\u201d said Mr Merz, describing the attack as the latest example of \u201cuninhibited brutality\u201d in Germany.\nIn advance of next month\u2019s general election, he promised new laws, on his first day in office, to end \u201call attempts at illegal entry without exception\u201d, including those without passports and \u201cthose entitled to protection\u201d.\nThis might breach European asylum rules, he conceded, but in this case Germany must \u201clet national law take precedence\u201d.\nWednesday\u2019s attack presents a dilemma for all of Germany\u2019s mainstream parties, in particular the CDU. Under Dr Merkel, Germany welcomed more than a million refugees during Europe\u2019s 2015-16 migrant crisis.\nIn its last three years in opposition, meanwhile, three million further people have arrived.\nWednesday\u2019s attack follows similar incidents reportedly involving asylum seekers and foreign nationals in Magdeburg, Mannheim, Solingen and other cities.  Many were due to leave the country after failed asylum applications.\nThe latest attack has rattled many Germans, including a breakfast television host who began crying while reading attack details on air on Thursday.

Not only is it anti-European, it is impossible to implement,\" she told reporters in Brussels.\nGermany's neighbor Austria, in any case, was not enthusiastic in greeting Merz's proposal.\nActing Chancellor Alexander Schallenberg of the center-right Austrian People's Party (\u00d6VP) said\u00a0that although he welcomed the fact that Berlin was reconsidering migration policy it must nevertheless stick to Schengen rules.\nSchallenberg also pointed to practical difficulties that would have to be tackled with such policies, for instance, that of determining where an individual first entered the EU before they could be sent back.\nMerz's plan would have German border guards simply deny entry to migrants trying to enter from other Schengen nations to gain asylum.\nTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video\nAndreas Rosskopf, head of the German Police Union GdP, said Merz's plan would mean that thousands of new officers would have to be hired and trained.\nRosskopf said roughly 1,000 riot police are regularly deployed to Germany's borders under current policy but added that what Merz is calling for would require far more.\n\"We would certainly need 8,000 to 10,000 additional officers to comprehensively control the border,\" said Rosskopf on Monday.\nHe also noted that Germany lacked much of the modern technology needed to truly control the country's borders, such as surveillance drones and license plate scanners.\nMerz's proposal is likely to find popular support as the issue of irregular migration has seen increased attention across broad swaths of German society, especially in light of a number of recent attacks carried out by migrants or residents with migrant backgrounds.\nThe question is whether he can find support in the Bundestag, and if so, from whom.\nWith Merz at the helm, the CDU has shifted away from the approach it took during the Merkel years, becoming more hardline on the issue of migration.\nAlthough he may be seeking to skim support from the anti-immigrant AfD with his pivot, it remains to be seen whether he can garner enough support from establishment parties to push through legislation, as well as if he will ignore the widely accepted firewall and close ranks with AfD.\nCurrently, the CDU leads election polling at 31%, with the AfD solidly in second at 20%, the SPD at 15%, and the Greens at 14%.\nTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video\nWhile you're here: Every Tuesday, DW editors round up what is happening in German politics and society.

Despite rising support for the AfD, Merz's commitment to a leftist coalition could hinder stricter migration policies. The decline in support for establishment parties mirrors trends across Europe, where populist parties are gaining ground. The AfD is calling for urgent action on border control following recent violent incidents linked to migrants.",
            "content": "The likely next Chancellor of Germany has categorically ruled out a coalition between his supposedly centre-right conservative party and the populist Alternative for Germany (AfD), opting instead to partner with a leftist party.\nAppearing at the World Economic Forum\u2019s annual meeting in Davos, Switzerland on this week, Christian Democratic Union (CDU) leader\u00a0Friedrich Merz said that he will \u201cnever\u201d allow \u201cright-wing populists into a government, which is led by me.\u201d\n\u201cI will try to get my partners in this coalition convinced that we have to immediately resolve the problems which made them as strong as they (the AfD) are today,\u201d Merz said.\nThe head of the formerly Merkel-led party argued that centrist parties in Germany need to \u201cresolve the problems which are seen by the people this is migration, this is anxiousness all day in terms of Labor Market\u2026 [and] criminality.\u201d\nWith Merz\u2019s CDU/CSU Union only hovering around a third of support from voters and his pre-emptive refusal of working with the AfD, the most likely coalition partner would be the Social Democrats (SPD) of current Chancellor Olaf Scholz. The other possible option would be with the hard-left Greens; however, Merz\u2019s partners in Bavaria have categorically rejected such a coalition.\nWhile Merz and others frequently hype up the supposed threat to democracy posed by the AfD, a partnership with the leftist SPD could potentially result in resistance to enforcing existing migration laws or even introducing new legislation to curb mass migration from within his own future government.\nThe CDU leader acknowledged that the rise in popularity of the AfD \u2014 currently in second place at around 20 per cent \u2014 was fuelled by concerns over mass migration, which the country was first opened up to by his party\u2019s former boss, Chancellor Angela Merkel, who unilaterally decided to open the gates of Europe to vast swathes of migrants from Africa and the Middle East, sparking the 2015 Europe Migrant Crisis.\nUpon coming into office in 2021, Chancellor Scholz\u2019s government doubled down on the open borders agenda. It has only made small steps starting to walk back on the issue following a string of high-profile terror attacks at the hands of migrants over the past year, including the\u00a0Magdeburg Christmas Market Attack that saw six killed and hundreds injured as a migrant from Saudi Arabia drove a car into the crowd.\nIt is perhaps unsurprising then that support for both establishment parties has withered. In the 1976 federal elections in Germany, the CDU and SPD won a combined 91.2 per cent of the vote. In the 2021 elections, it fell to 49.8 per cent, and according to the latest polling, support for the establishment parties is set to decline again in February\u2019s elections.\nThe crumbling support for the SPD and CDU in Germany follows the recent collapse of other European neo-liberal parties, which also attempted to impose a\u00a0cordon sanitaire around right-wing populist parties.\nThe most dramatic reversal of such a policy was seen last year in the Netherlands, where Dutch populist Geert Wilders and his Party for Freedom (PVV) formed a government after winning the 2023 elections. Their national conservatives had absolutely ruled out going into coalition with the populists before the vote but reconsidered once the results were in.\nGermany\u2019s neighbour Austria also appears on course to have a populist-controlled government in Vienna, with Austrian Freedom Party (FP\u00d6) leader Herbert Kickl being invited to form a government earlier this month.\nFollowing another attack allegedly at the hands of a migrant from Afghanistan on Wednesday in the town of Aschaffenburg that left two dead, including a young child, and left others seriously injured, AfD chancellor candidate Alice Weidel said that it demonstrated the need for the CDU to work with her party, saying that there \u201cmust [not] be more deaths\u201d because of the firewall against her party.\nThe AfD leader went on to call for a vote in the German Bundestag parliament next week on\u00a0\u201cclosing the borders and turning back illegal immigrants.\u201d\nPlease let us know if you're having issues with commenting.\nCopyright \u00a9 2025 Breitbart",

The suspect has a history of violent behaviour and had been undergoing psychiatric treatment.\n\"TICKING TIME BOMBS\"\n\"There are 40,000 asylum applicants who need to be deported,\" Merz told reporters. \"A local politician told me this weekend that there are ticking time bombs walking around our towns and communities.\"\nIt had been five months since the last deportation flight to Afghanistan, he added, accusing Scholz of inaction.\nMerz's critics say he risks dismantling the German political mainstream's firewall against cooperation with the far right if he wins a parliamentary motion thanks to AfD backing.\nForeign Minister Annalena Baerbock said Merz's proposal for a restoration of permanent border controls within the European Union's Schengen passport-free travel zone was unworkable and a betrayal of Germany's responsibility to EU partners.\n\"If we start doing this, Europe breaks down,\" Baerbock, a member of the Greens, told reporters in Brussels. \"Not only is it anti-European, it's impossible to implement.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSuspect in German Christmas market attack held on murder charges\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFounded over a decade ago by right-wing economists who opposed the EU single currency, the AfD has become increasingly nativist and focused on the supposed threat to Germany's identity posed by immigration.\nGerman authorities classify the AfD as an anti-democratic, far-right party and so far all other parties have refused to govern with it, confining it to opposition even after it scored a series of record gains in regional elections this autumn.\nThe AfD is now running second in pre-election polls, behind the conservative bloc.\nThe border control gambit is not without risks for Merz.\nHis original pitch to lead the conservatives was that, by breaking with former Chancellor Angela Merkel's immigration-friendly centrism, he could \"halve\" the far right in the opinion polls by winning back their voters.\nHe has not been wholly successful - when he assumed the CDU chairmanship in 2022, the AfD was on 10 per cent and the conservative bloc on around 25 per cent. Now, the AfD is pushing 20 per cent, while the conservatives have added just five points.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    Source: Reuters/ec\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSign up for our newsletters\nGet our pick of top stories and thought-provoking articles in your inbox\nSubscribe here\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGet the CNA app\nStay updated with notifications for breaking news and our best stories\nDownload here\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGet WhatsApp alerts\nJoin our channel for the top reads for the day on your preferred chat app\nJoin here\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n      Related Topics\n  \n\n      Germany\n  \n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n      Also worth reading\n  \n\nContent is loading...\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdvertisement",

The suspect, arrested shortly afterward, is a 28-year-old Afghan with a history of psychiatric problems and violence who said over a month ago that he would leave Germany voluntarily.\nHis asylum application was rejected in 2023 and authorities failed to send him back to Bulgaria, where he first arrived in the European Union, according to Bavarian officials, who pointed the finger at the federal migration office.\nChancellor Olaf Scholz, whose center-left party trails in polls ahead of Germany's Feb. 23 election, met the heads of the country's security services on Wednesday evening and said they will \u201cdraw the necessary consequences. Now.\u201d He didn't specify what those would be.\nHis main election challenger, Friedrich Merz, whose center-right Union bloc leads polls, stepped up his party's vows to toughen migration policy. He said Germany has had a \u201cmisguided asylum and immigration policy\u201d for 10 years \u2014 since Angela Merkel, a chancellor from his own party and a former Merz rival, allowed large numbers of migrants into the country.\nMerz said that if he becomes chancellor, he would order the Interior Ministry on his first day in office to control all of Germany's borders permanently and \u201cturn back all attempts at illegal entry without exception.\" He argued that EU rules are \u201crecognizably dysfunctional\" and Germany must exert a right to the primacy of national law.\nMerz added that people who are supposed to leave the country must no longer be let go if they are picked up by police and should be taken into custody and deported as quickly as possible, helped by an increase in detention capacity.\nMerz, who may well have to form a coalition with center-left parties to become chancellor, insisted that \u201ccompromises are no longer possible on these issues.\u201d\nThe outgoing government already instituted temporary controls on all of Germany's borders and has argued that progress has been made in reducing unauthorized entry and increasing deportations.\nThe Aschaffenburg attack followed knife attacks in Mannheim and Solingen last year in which the suspects were immigrants from Afghanistan and Syria respectively; in the latter case, also a rejected asylum-seeker. In last month\u2019s Christmas market car ramming attack in Magdeburg, the suspect is a Saudi doctor who had come to various regional authorities\u2019 attention in the past.\nMainstream parties are feeling pressure from the strong poll ratings of the far-right Alternative for Germany, with which all say they won't work after the election. Discontent about migration is a mainstay of its support, which recent surveys show at about 20%, putting it in second place.\nAlice Weidel, Alternative for Germany's candidate for chancellor, said on social media platform X that the outgoing parliament should vote next week on closing Germany's borders and turning back irregular migrants.\nGerman authorities have said that 229,751 people applied for asylum in Germany last year, a 30% decrease from the previous year. There were 18,384 deportations in the year's first 11 months, compared with 16,430 in all of 2023.\nOpposition politicians complained Thursday that there have been no further deportations to Afghanistan since a first flight in August.\n24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events",

Merz's plan includes permanent border controls, deportations, and stricter family reunification limits.

            "content": "A row over Germany\u2019s open borders immigration system threatens to upend the political status quo ahead of the February general election, as the leader of Angela Merkel\u2019s former party opened the door to passing restrictions with the help of the populist Alternative for Germany (AfD) party, sparking panic among the Berlin establishment.\nLeading leftist figures of the now-defunct \u2018traffic light\u2019 coalition government have railed against the leader of the neo-liberal Christian Democratic Union (CDU) and likely next chancellor, Friedrich Merz, after he called for the Bundestag parliament to usher in migration restrictions and expressed willingness to pass the measures with votes from the AfD, despite having vowed to continue the cordon sanitaire around the party when forming the next government in Berlin.\nMerz has called on leftist establishment parties, including the Social Democrats (SPD) and the Greens, to back his proposed reforms to undercut the populist support for the AfD ahead of the February 23rd general election.\nSupport for the anti-mass migration AfD has steadily risen over the past year amid a string of brutal terror attacks committed by migrants in Germany, most recently, the stabbing spree in\u00a0Aschaffenburg last week, which left two dead, including a two-year-old boy, allegedly at the hands of a migrant from Afghanistan.\nSpurred by the\u00a0Aschaffenburg attack, as well as other recent attacks in\u00a0Magdeburg, Mannheim, and Solingen,\u00a0Merz called for the implementation of permanent border controls and the rejection of all attempts to enter the country illegally. The CDU leader also called for a \u201cdrastic reduction\u201d in the number of illegals living in the country through regular deportations, including to countries such as Afghanistan and Syria.\nHis plan advocated for those with orders to leave the country to be\u00a0\u201cimmediately taken into custody\u201d and for the establishment of migrant removal centres across the country. Additionally, the Merz plan said that serious criminals with dual nationalities should have their German citizenship revoked. Finally, the proposal argues for limits to be placed on family reunification, also known as chain migration.\nMerz demanded that the Bundestag vote on the measures as soon as this week, saying on Monday: \u201cIt\u2019s really time to make decisions now.\u201d\nCritics on the left have argued that such measures would contravene European Union rules surrounding migration. However, the CDU has claimed that the national government must step in if the EU fails. The CDU also specifically cited the rising support for \u201cpopulists\u201d as justification for the restrictions.\n\u201cThe AfD uses problems, worries and fears caused by mass illegal migration to fuel xenophobia and spread conspiracy theories. She wants Germany to leave the EU and the euro and instead turn to Putin\u2019s Eurasian Economic Union. All of this endangers Germany\u2019s stability, security and prosperity. That\u2019s why this party is not a partner, but our political opponent,\u201d the former Merkel-led party said.\nYet, despite the condemnation, Merz has said that he would be willing to pass the migration restrictions with the support of the AfD and others, such as the leftist populist BSW party and the Free Democrats (FDP), if the other establishment parties refuse to back the vote. This would represent a precedent-breaking step and perhaps an indication that the establishment firewall around the AfD is beginning to crack.\n\u201cWhat is right in the matter will not be wrong because the wrong people agree,\u201d Merz said while still calling on the former traffic light coalition parties to back his proposal in order to \u201cprevent there from being majorities that none of us want\u201d.\nMerz has claimed that regardless of the vote outcome, the CDU would not join a coalition government with the AfD. But his willingness to pass migration reform with their help has sparked a steep backlash from the establishment.\nRobert Habeck, the chancellor candidate for the Greens and finance minister, said that if the CDU and AfD join together to pass migration reform, it would be a \u201cdangerous step\u2026 a step too far.\u201d\n\u201cCooperation means accepting a majority with approval, knowing that it comes from the AfD,\u201d he said. \u201cIn any case, this is no longer the Union we know that claims to stand for the centre in Germany. That\u2019s over then.\u201d\nChancellor Olaf Scholz added:\u00a0\u201cThere must be no cooperation with extreme right-wing parties in Germany, at any time and nowhere.\u201d\nFor her part, AfD chancellor candidate Alice Weidel accused Merz of acting like a \u201cdoormat\u201d for the establishment and of playing \u201ctactical games\u201d. She said that the people of Germany \u201cwant the migration turnaround!

At the time, Merkel\u2019s pronouncement symbolized Germany\u2019s proverbial \u201cwelcome culture,\u201d which manifested in its willingness to take in several hundred thousand asylum seekers.\nMerz\u2019s motive in distancing himself so firmly from Merkel\u2019s legacy is clear. Ahead of a national election set for Feb. 23, Merz\u2019s center-right Christian Democratic Union (CDU) is in a fierce fight to keep more conservatives from defecting to the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) party \u2014\u00a0and views Merkel\u2019s legacy as a liability.\nThe AfD is now polling in second place on 21 percent after a rise in support in recent weeks, but is still well behind Merz\u2019s first-place conservatives, who are at 30 percent.\nDuring the campaign the AfD has hammered home a consistent message: Merz and Merkel are cut from the same cloth. At the AfD\u2019s convention earlier this month, for instance, Alice Weidel, the party\u2019s chancellor candidate, dedicated much of her speech to equating Merz with Merkel and depicting the CDU as essentially a leftist party that has let migration and crime run amok in Germany.\n\u201cWe know the CDU, dear Ms. Merkel, and we know you too, dear Mr. Merz,\u201d Weidel said. She then urged Germans to opt for the AfD, or as she put it: \u201cVote for the original.\u201d\nMerz has pulled the CDU much farther to the right since taking over the leadership of the party in 2022, not only on migration but also on energy and the economy. While Merz has long opposed Merkel\u2019s more centrist approach, however, until now he has rarely drawn such a stark contrast with her as he did in Flensburg.\nDuring his speech, Merz argued that Germany is taking in far more migrants than it can possibly integrate. The country, he said, could not take in millions of asylum seekers and provide schools, healthcare and housing for them, \u201cno matter how hard we try.\u201d\n\u201cI promise you this,\u201d he added. \u201cUnder my leadership, the numbers will drastically go down, because we are serious about limiting illegal migration to Germany.\u201d\nMerz\u2019s conservatives \u2014\u00a0like all other German parliamentary parties \u2014 have ruled out a coalition with the AfD after the election, maintaining a firewall around the far-right party. Given that stance, the conservatives\u2019 likeliest coalition partners  are the center-left Greens and the Social Democratic Party.\nThe AfD has tried use the firewall for its own gain, attacking the CDU for preferring to govern with leftist parties.\n\u201cThe CDU has unconditionally surrendered to a leftist-Green ideology,\u201d Weidel said during her convention speech, calling the CDU a \u201cparty of betrayal.\u201d\nMerz is in a more difficult spot politically, attempting to double down on his tough-on-migration message while at the same time distancing his party from the AfD \u2014\u00a0a delicate task as he tries to peel away that party\u2019s supporters.\n\u201cWe don\u2019t think the same as them,\u201d he said of the AfD in Flensburg. \u201cIt\u2019s not the Alternative for Germany. It\u2019s the demise of Germany.\u201d\nFormer chancellor\u2019s intervention exposes deep rift within country\u2019s conservatives over how to handle the far right\u2019s rising influence.\nSocial Democrat chancellor launches stinging attack on conservative leader over deal with far-right AfD.\n\u201cThis will break Europe,\u201d Robert Habeck says, as fears grow over the broader implications of collaboration between the CDU and AfD.\nGermany\u2019s likely next chancellor wants tougher migration measures even with far-right support, triggering a backlash ahead of a national election.",

He had agreed to leave Germany last month but was still receiving psychiatric treatment and living in asylum accommodation.\nAn investigating judge will decide whether he should be remanded in custody or placed temporarily in a psychiatric hospital.\nMerz said that on his first day as chancellor he would instruct the interior ministry to take permanent control of Germany's borders.\n\"We see before us the ruins of 10 years of misguided asylum and immigration policy in Germany,\" he said. \"We reached the limit.\"\nUnder his party colleague, Angela Merkel, Germany welcomed more than a million refugees during Europe's 2015-16 migrant crisis.\nCriticising EU asylum rules as as \"recognisably dysfunctional\", he said Germany should now \"exercise its right to the primacy of national law\".\nGermany has already reinstated checks on its borders to combat illegal immigration, which is allowed temporarily under the EU's border-free Schengen rules as a \"last-resort\" measure, but not on permanent basis.\nMerz also said it was time to significantly increase the number of places available for detention ahead of deportation.\nMerz's promise to close the borders to illegal entries on day one at the chancellery in Berlin has a Trumpian ring to it.\nThe US president has pushed through a flurry of executive orders and actions to tackle illegal immigration since he re-entered the White House this week.\nIn Germany, both the centre-left chancellor and Merz are conscious that the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD), which has been consistently polling second, has made immigration a signature issue.\nAfD leader Alice Weidel has called for a vote in the German parliament next week on closing Germany's borders and turning back irregular migrants. \"The knife terror of Aschaffenburg must have consequences now,\" she said on social media.\nSome critics will argue that Scholz and Merz's move to take a tougher stance now comes too late. Others will argue that a rightwards shift by mainstream parties could simply bolster the AfD's arguments.\nIn any case German politics does not lend itself to a presidential-style set of day-one decrees, given the necessity of forming coalitions with other parties.\nThe leader of the liberal Free Democratic Party, Christian Lindner, said Merz would not be able to introduce such changes if he went into coalition with the Social Democrats or Green party.\nNancy Faeser, who is both interior minister and a party colleague of Olaf Scholz, suggested that \"some people are now making largely fact-free arguments in election campaign mode\".\n\"I can only warn very clearly against abusing such a terrible act for populism, that only benefits the right-wing populists with their contempt for humanity,\" she said.\nThe 41-year-old man who was killed in Wednesday's knife attack has been praised, apparently for coming to the aid of the kindergarten group and saving the lives of other children.\nAnother two-year-old of Syrian origin suffered knife wounds to her neck.\nA man of 72 suffered serious stab wounds and a kindergarten teacher suffered a broken arm.\nGermany's Bundestag descends into recrimination after a \"firewall\" against working with the far-right cracks.\nWorld leaders rubbed shoulders with 56 survivors of Hitler's death camp as they marked 80 years since its liberation.\nIt is 80 years since Soviet Union troops liberated Auschwitz - now marked as Holocaust Memorial Day.\nFifty survivors - now in their late 80s and 90s - will attend a ceremony marking the camp's liberation.\nGerman meat and dairy products are banned in Guernsey after an outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease.\nCopyright 2025 BBC.

Following Russia's full-fledged invasion of Ukraine, refugees arriving in Germany and were subject to an EU Council Directive for temporary protection in the event of a mass influx of displaced persons for whom the regular asylum procedures do not apply. They were granted temporary residency status and entitled to full social welfare benefits.\nThe CSU's Stephan Stracke, social policy spokesman for the CDU/CSU's parliamentary group, told DW that while anyone fleeing \"war and violence\" had a right to protection, \"This does not mean, however, that there must be an automatic entitlement to the citizen's income in Germany.\" Instead, Stracke said, newly arrived Ukrainian war refugees should receive asylum-seeker benefits \"at first.\"\nTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video\nGermany is currently home to around 1.2 million Ukrainian refugees, around 530,000 of whom are classified by the Federal Employment Agency as eligible to work and entitled to citizens' income (as of May 2024).\nThat means they receive an unemployment benefit of up to \u20ac563 ($596) per month plus their rent and heating costs paid by the state. There is an extra allowance for children, staggered by age, and around 360,000 of the Ukrainian refugees in Germany are children. Stracke's proposal \u2014 for Ukrainians to receive the standard asylum seekers' benefit instead \u2014 would mean that Ukrainians would receive only \u20ac460 per month.\nThe CDU's move is part of a general planned overhaul of the B\u00fcrgergeld system if they get into power, which will include tougher sanctions for refusing work and more mandatory visits to the authorities.\nThe tougher comments on Ukrainian refugees are not new among German conservatives: Two years ago, CDU leader Friedrich Merz, who is predicted to head Germany's next government questioned the Ukranians' need for protection: \"We are now experiencing a form of social tourism among these refugees: to Germany, back to Ukraine, to Germany, back to Ukraine,\" Merz told the Bild TV outlet in 2022, triggering widespread outrage.\nIn a newly updated study, the German Institute for Employment Research (IAB) found that Germany was struggling to integrate Ukrainians into the job market, at least compared with other countries \u2014 but also that the situation was improving: Only 27% of Ukrainians in Germany had found work as of March this year, compared to 57% in Lithuania and 53% in Denmark (though that was still ahead of Ukrainians in Norway, Spain, and Finland, where only around 20% had found work). \u2014 and finding childcare and schooling has become increasingly difficult.\nAccording to Germany's right-wing parties, like the CDU and the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD), the high number of refugees living off social welfare is partly down to the amount of money they receive. \"Germany has obviously not been particularly successful in getting Ukrainian refugees into work so far,\" said Stracke. \"Other European countries are doing much better. That is why we in Germany have to give more weight to the principle of supporting and challenging people to find work.\"\nBut the IAB study also shows that the proportion of Ukrainians in work is steadily rising in all the European countries \u2014 and that there is little evidence to show that there is a correlation with the amount of state help they receive. More significant factors than benefits, the IAB said, were language barriers and demand for labor in the low-wage sector, where it is easier to find work.\nIryna Shulikina, executive director at the Berlin-based NGO Vitsche, which supports Ukrainian refugees in Germany, said Ukrainians encounter several obstacles to finding work in Germany, most notably getting through the bureaucratic process. According to the IAB, some 72% of Ukrainian refugees have either a university degree or a vocational qualification \u2014 more than other refugees or the German working population in general.\n\"When they come here, they face the difficulties of getting their diplomas approved here,\" Shulikina said.\nTo name one example: Though Germany faces a shortage of medical workers, Shulikina said she had spoken to Ukrainian medical workers who needed two and a half years to get to the stage where they could work: Applying for work, getting their documents and qualifications approved, doing the necessary tests, learning the language. \"It's a real challenge,\" she said.\nTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video\nWhether a likely CDU-led government will succeed in changing conditions for Ukrainian refugees will depend also on its coalition partners: The center-left Social Democrats (SPD) are less inclined to crack down on social welfare recipients, while leading members of the neoliberal Free Democrats (FDP), have already expressed their support for recategorizing Ukrainian war refugees \u2014 even though the party's parliamentary group declined to state an official position to DW for this article.\nShulikina put the current political debate on the issue of B\u00fcrgergeld down to election campaigning and did not accept the argument that the citizens' income was keeping Ukrainian refugees at home.\n\"All the people I know who are refugees and have anything to do with the Job Center are doing everything possible to end this relationship,\" she said. \"It's very humiliating and annoying. You are very dependent, and you are not perceived as an equal part of society \u2014 you're asked about every cent you spend and how and when. I don't believe there are a lot of people who enjoy getting B\u00fcrgergeld.\"\nLyudmyla Mlosch, chairperson of the Central Council of Ukrainians in Germany (ZVUD), said many Ukrainians she knows in Germany don't want to be here at all. \"I know a lot of people here who are dreaming of going home, but they have no home \u2014 they've lost everything,\" said Mlosch. \"Of course they need support.\"\nBut Mlosch did admit that some Ukrainians are more desperate than others: Those from the regions in the east that are under almost continual bombardment from Russia are more in need of state help, for example, as are older or sick people, or people who have no savings. \"They don't need to all be put in the same bracket. But younger people who can work, they could have their money reduced, I could admit that,\" she said.\nEdited by Rina Goldenberg\nWhile you're here: Every Tuesday, DW editors round up what is happening in German politics and society.

Both countries are struggling with fiscal challenges, with France's national debt and budget deficit significantly exceeding EU limits, while Germany maintains a lower deficit but faces calls for increased spending. The disunity and economic difficulties could hinder Europe's response to Trump's policies, emphasizing the need for cooperation between Germany and France.",
            "content": "Europe's two most important economies will lack stable governments when Donald Trump assumes office as US president. Often called the twin engines of EU growth, they are hampered by huge economic and financial problems.\nLong before Donald Trump's inauguration on January 20, the US president-elect threatened Europeans with high tariffs on their products, reduced\u00a0support for Ukraine, and a reassessment of NATO's funding.\nGiven the turbulence ahead, it would be crucial for the 27 European Union (EU) member states to demonstrate unity and speak with one voice. However, when Trump takes office, Germany and France will not have stable governments, let alone their current leaders finding common ground on how to deal with Trump's policies.\nThese two countries, often referred to as the \"engines of EU growth,\" have the largest populations and economies in the bloc.\nTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video\nIn Germany, Chancellor Olaf Scholz's government, consisting of Social Democrats and Greens, no longer has a majority in parliament. The country is gearing up for\u00a0snap elections on February 23.\nLatest polls suggest that no party will achieve an outright majority, making coalition negotiations inevitable after the election. It is expected that at least two months will pass after Trump's inauguration before Germany forms a functioning government.\nIn France, instability is expected to last even longer. According to the French constitution, new elections cannot be held until July 2025 at the earliest. Until then, the unclear majority stemming from the July 2024 election will remain.\nThe French National Assembly has three major blocs, none of which has a governing majority: the far-right National Rally (RN), the leftist coalition New Popular Front (NFP), and President Emmanuel Macron's centrist Ensemble pour la Republique (Ensemble), and its allies.\nClaire Demesmay, a political scientist at Sciences Po in Paris and a researcher at the Franco-German Center for Social Sciences in Berlin, describes the current political situation in France as \"highly unstable.\"\n\"There is no majority in parliament, and the three blocs refuse to cooperate,\" she told DW, adding that French politics has no tradition of building multi-party coalition governments like Germany. \"France's political culture is confrontational and lacks a tradition of compromise, making it difficult to form a majority government.\"\nTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video\nBoth countries are entering the new year without approved budgets due to fiscal disputes. In Germany, Scholz's former three-party coalition collapsed over budget disagreements. In France, conservative prime minister, Michel Barnier, failed to pass a budget and lost a confidence vote on December 4, 2024. President Macron then appointed centrist Francois Bayrou as prime minister on December 13 to form a new government.\nCarsten Brzeski, chief economist at ING Bank, says Germany and France are pursuing opposite fiscal policies which is \"worsening the situation further.\" While France is burdened with high debt and would need more austerity, Germany should increase spending on its aging infrastructure. \"France must become more German, and Germany more French,\" he told DW.\nFrance now has the third-highest national debt in the eurozone after Greece and Italy, while Germany only slightly exceeds the EU's debt ceiling of 60% of annual gross domestic product (GDP)\u00a0allowed under the so-called Maastricht Treaty on fiscal policy.\nMoreover, the French national budget deficit \u2014 projected at 6% of GDP for 2024 \u00ad\u2014 is double the allowed limit of 3% for eurozone countries. This has already triggered an EU deficit procedure and plunged the new French prime minister into the same dilemma as his predecessor: Meeting EU fiscal rules requires austerity, but securing parliamentary approval for serious spending cuts requires a stable majority, which\u00a0is unlikely before summer 2025.\nWhile Demesmay described France's fiscal problems as \"trying to put a square peg in a round hole,\" financial markets are already reacting strongly. The risk premium on French debt recently hit its highest level since the eurozone debt crisis in 2010. And international ratings agency Moody's added to the trouble in December by downgrading France's credit rating, citing political fragmentation and fiscal instability.\nGermany, in stark contrast, has a budget deficit of less than 3% of GDP due to its so-called debt brake enshrined in the constitution. Critics of the limit on fresh borrowing\u00a0say it must be scrapped or at least reformed to free up urgently needed funding for the country's aging infrastructure. However, the two-thirds majority for reform can only be found by the next government.\nFrance's central bank is expecting economic growth to come in at 1.1% for\u00a02024 but has lowered its 2025 forecast to 0.9%, citing \"rising uncertainties\" to growth at home and abroad.\nEurope's biggest economy, Germany, is expected to see a\u00a0second consecutive year in recession in 2024, with the central bank projecting rather negligible growth of 0.2% for 2025. The biggest risk factor is the probability of \"globally rising [trade] protectionism,\" the bank said.\nFor Germany's export-driven economy, promoting\u00a0free trade with new agreements could provide some relief. A first step was taken\u00a0in December when the EU Commission and the South American Mercosur trade bloc\u00a0signed a treaty that will create the world's largest free trade zone, encompassing around 700 million people.\nHowever, it remains uncertain whether and how the agreement will be ratified by member states after France made it clear that it opposes the treaty.\n\"The trade issue is a classic point of contention between Germany and France,\" said Demesmay. \"In France, large trade agreements are viewed much more critically than in Germany. There is a prevailing sense that the country's future is no longer in its own hands, which is politically dangerous.\"\nThe lack of unity between the two leading nations in Europe could also become a problem when Donald Trump starts his second term. During his first term (2017\u20132021), Europeans often appeared caught off guard, unsure of how to respond to Trump's erratic policy announcements and social media posts.\nToday, Europeans are better prepared than they were eight years ago, believes Carsten Brzeski, who advises against merely reacting to Trump's actions.\n\"Instead, they should focus on their domestic economies, invest in infrastructure, and push for structural reforms,\" he said. Therefore, he advocates for close policy coordination between Germany and France. \"From past experience, we know that if the two largest economies don't cooperate and drive the European project forward, progress in Europe will be very slow.\"\nThis article was originally written in German.",

The full implementation of these reforms awaits parliamentary approval in 2025.",

More significantly, the total funding pot available in Germany for now stays the same, at around $374 million per year. German producers had been eagerly awaiting a more sweeping reform under which \u201cthe big difference\u201d was the elimination of the cap and therefore a much bigger pot, Kreuzer says.\nAs things stand, \u201cfor many projects the money will be in place,\u201d says Simone Baumann, head of promotional body German Films. But, she added, \u201ccome August or September the money will be gone.\u201d\nThe long-gestating new German film law \u2013 only a portion of which was passed on Friday \u2013 is based on three pillars. The first is local film subsidies, which was approved. The other two are the tax incentive to lure more international productions, which the German parliament only temporarily modified by raising its existing cash grant to 30%. And the third is the introduction of an investment obligation for streamers that could generate an estimated additional $624 million for German film and TV productions per year. The tax credit and investment obligations are expected to go back before parliament sometime in 2025.\n\u201cIf we have elections at the end of February, then probably we will have a government in April or beginning of May,\u201d says Baumann, who hopes the remaining two pillars of the German film law will go back before parliament for debate and approval next fall.\nThe draft of the investment obligation for streamers, which includes a rights-sharing requirement, would force domestic and foreign streamers to invest 20% of revenues generated in Germany back into European productions, 70% of which would have to be in the German language.\nGerman producers and streaming companies have long been fighting over the investment obligation, which would implement the European Union\u2019s game-changing Audiovisual Media Services Directive and prompt new rules of engagement between producers and streaming giants. Stumbling blocks in Germany include the contention by streaming giants that they would be forced to make non-economically sustainable investments, and also the fact that many German production companies are owned by broadcasters.\n\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of discussion around it,\u201d says Baumann, who thinks that ultimately, German producers will \u201chave to downsize the [20%] percentage [of revenues] they are asking for.\u201d\n\u201cOtherwise, it might not happen at all,\u201d she says.\nA Variety and iHeartRadio Podcast\nThe Business of Entertainment",

Both countries may resort to provisional budget management, limiting spending to essential functions. Scholz and French Prime Minister Michel Barnier are navigating political challenges as they approach key parliamentary decisions.",
            "content": "French lawmakers have rejected a draft budget for 2025, while Germany is also going into the new year without a final spending plan.\nGerman Chancellor Olaf Scholz and French Prime Minister Michel Barnier have similar problems at the moment: They would like to push through policies, but do not have enough funds from parliament to do so.\nOn Tuesday, France's lower house, the National Assembly, overwhelmingly rejected the first part of the budget for 2025, which involved revenues, by a large majority. While 392 lawmakers voted against it, 192 lawmakers from the government camp and from the far-right National Rally voted in favor. The vote came after a two-week debate in which the left-wing New Popular Front alliance, which makes up the largest political bloc in parliament, had reshaped the bill with amendments.\nThese included wealth tax on billionaires, a tax hike on \"super-dividends\" from large corporations, a tax on multinationals and higher taxes for digital companies, as well as a new tax for particularly loud motorcycles. Lawmakers had also scrapped the government's plans to impose higher taxes on electricity and gas heating,\u00a0and not replaced it.\nThe national budget is a government program expressed in figures. In these times of upheaval, these figures are\u00a0lacking in both Berlin and Paris.\nWhile Barnier can still hope for a regular budget in 2025 despite this defeat, the current minority government in Berlin cannot. At best, a supplementary budget for 2024 could, with opposition support, be passed before the dissolution of the Bundestag ahead of a snap election in February.\nThis is necessary because the German government is still short of money. It needs \u20ac3.7 billion (ca. $3.9 billion) to cover additional expenditure for the Citizen's Allowance, a state welfare benefit for basic income support, and more than \u20ac10 billion to promote renewable energies. If it doesn't find this money before the end of the year, it will have to respond with a budget freeze.\nWhen US President-elect Donald Trump returns to the White House on January 20,\u00a0the Bundestag will probably have been dissolved. Almost five weeks later, on February 23, Germans will then elect a new parliament. Depending on the results, the formation of a government could drag on well into spring.\nGermany will still have a chancellor and ministers after the dissolution of parliament by the president, but only in an executive capacity. During the transition phase, they will no longer be allowed to make fundamental or far-reaching decisions.\nOnly a new government will be able to negotiate with the new Trump administration or push ahead with decisions at the European Union level. Until then, Germany will have to wait and see.\nBut perhaps some will also be breathing a sigh of relief, as the coalition that has now failed has been considered a difficult partner in Brussels in recent years. In recent years, the coalition government repeatedly avoided making delicate decisions by abstaining, for example on the EU Supply Chain Act and on emissions regulations for trucks.\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron nominated 73-year-old Barnier from the conservative Republican party as prime minister after he dissolved parliament and prompted a fresh parliamentary election\u00a0earlier this year. Even together, Macron's centrist alliance and the Republicans do not have a majority in the National Assembly. They also don't have a binding government program, despite Barnier being in office for two months now.\nThe fact that the 2025 budget failed in the National Assembly could help the prime minister, because it is not the amended draft that will go to the upper house, the Senate, but the government's original draft.\nThe cuts to social benefits and public spending totaling around \u20ac60 billion for the 2025 budget are likely to have an easier time in the conservative Senate than in the National Assembly, where the necessity for austerity is more controversial. In June, the European Commission launched an excessive deficit procedure\u00a0against France and reprimanded it for breaking budget rules.\nCredit rating agencies are also keeping an eye on Paris. With a deficit of 6% of GDP this year and a mountain of debt amounting to 113% of GDP, France's budget situation is dramatic.\nShortly after Chancellor Scholz faces a vote of confidence in the Bundestag on December 16, the fate of his French counterpart could also be decided. According to the current timetable, the French budget for 2025 is due to be finalized by the joint mediation committee of both houses of parliament in the last week before Christmas. The National Assembly will then have to make the final decision.\nIt's quite possible that the French government, faced with the threat of defeat, will resort to Article 49.3 of the Constitution to pass the budget without a final vote. If the government relies on this special article, the opposition will have 24 hours to table a motion of censure. If this receives a majority, the government will have to resign and the draft budget will fail.\nIf this happens, the EU's two largest economies would be paralyzed and forced to resort to provisional budget management at the turn of a decisive year. In both countries, such budget management is limited to obligations that already exist or are legally prescribed and only intended to guarantee the basic functions of the state.\u00a0Salaries, pensions and social benefits are covered but political projects remain on hold.\nScholz and Barnier will meet in the Berlin this coming week, when the latter makes\u00a0his first official visit to the German capital as prime minister.\nThis article was originally written in German.\nTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video",

            "title": "Does Germany need wind power?",
            "summary": "As Germany approaches federal elections, wind power is a focal point in party manifestos, with significant gains in the sector. In 2024, regulators approved over 2,400 new onshore wind turbines, boosting capacity to a record 14 gigawatts. However, the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) and CDU leaders oppose wind energy, advocating for a return to nuclear power and fossil fuels. Experts argue against dismantling wind infrastructure, citing high costs and the need for renewables to achieve climate goals. The current government has streamlined permitting for renewables, aiming for 115 gigawatts of onshore wind by 2030, which could stabilize energy prices.",
            "content": "As Germany moves towards federal elections, wind power features in many party manifestos. Some politicians would prefer a return to nuclear power, but Germany's wind sector is on track to make significant gains.\nGermany's leading source of electric power generation got a big boost in 2024, according to latest industry figures.\nRegulators approved more than 2,400 new onshore wind turbines with a total output of around 14 gigawatts, a record high, said a new report from the German Wind Energy Association and VDMA Power Systems, the association for power plant engineering.\n\"This is a significant step in the right direction,\" said Dennis Rendschmidt, VDMA's managing director. He said the government must \"maintain this momentum,\" no matter the outcome of the February 23 federal election.\nBut despite the positive figures, the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) has made vehement opposition to Germany's energy policies \u2014 and wind in particular \u2014 a key part of its election campaign. At the AfD's recent party congress, chancellor candidate Alice Weidel railed against \"fluctuating\" renewable energy, which she told German broadcaster ZDF didn't work \"when the wind doesn't blow and the sun doesn't shine.\"\nWind has also come under fire from Friedrich Merz, chairman of the center-right Christian Democratic Union (CDU). At the end of last year, Merz publicly described wind power as an \"ugly\" \"transition energy\" that might someday be dismantled. But the party's election manifesto \u2014 compiled together with its Bavarian sister party the CSU \u2014 talks about making use of all renewable energy sources, including both on and offshore wind.\nSpeaking at the AfD congress, Weidel vowed to tear down all of Germany's \"windmills of shame.\" She called for Germany to boost the use of\u00a0fossil fuels, including Russian gas, and bring back nuclear power as part of a \"sustainable, serious energy mix\" \u2014 a plan which most experts have said is unrealistic.\n\"A return to nuclear power in Germany is not plausible or helpful, in terms of climate protection \u2014 nor would it be economical,\" said Wolf-Peter Schill, an energy expert at the German Institute for Economic Research in Berlin, pointing out that Germany shut down its last three reactors nearly two years ago.\n\"[The reactors] have already been dismantled to such an extent that they cannot simply be put back into operation.\" Building new nuclear plants, he added, would take far too long to be any help in achieving climate goals.\nActually doing away with all of Germany's wind turbines, which today number more than 30,000, would, according to experts, cost the country dearly in decommissioning fees, expropriation and compensation payments. And that's without factoring in the costs related to making up the energy shortfall, as Germany would be forced to increase its electricity imports, driving up the price of electricity for consumers and businesses.\nWhile Schill said a huge increase in solar energy could help to replace wind to some extent, he stressed that photovoltaic panels were not always the best option to replace wind turbines in Germany, especially in the dark winter months.\n\"If you don't want wind power or solar energy, then the only option is fossil fuels,\" he told DW. \"I don't see any other realistic option for power generation in Germany.\" Burning fossil fuels for such things as\u00a0heating and industry\u00a0is the main driver of the rising global temperatures linked to extreme weather events around the world.\nDespite Weidel's claim that renewable energy was holding Germany back, the latest government figures appear to prove otherwise. Data released by the Bundesnetzagentur, the federal energy regulator, in early January showed that 59% of Germany's electricity in 2024 came from renewable sources, up from 56% in 2023. Slightly more than half of that came from wind.\nRobert Habeck, Germany's climate and economic affairs minister, credited the growth to the moves made by the center-left SPD/Greens/FDP coalition government to \"simplify and accelerate\" the permitting process for wind and solar installations over the last two years.\nTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video\nSchill said the decisions made by the outgoing government have set the stage for \"much stronger growth\" for wind energy, potentially putting Germany on track to hit its target of 115 gigawatts of installed capacity for onshore wind power by 2030. Larger, more advanced wind turbines are now being built to replace older power stations, and could help bring renewables up to around 80% of the country's total energy supply.\nSchill said it would be \"absurd\" for the next government not to capitalize on the boost given to the renewables sector. \"This AfD take, to not only put the brakes on wind power but even to dismantle it, goes completely in the wrong direction.\"\nOther parties like Germany's new populist Sahra Wagenknecht Alliance (BSW) says in its manifesto that it wants to replace old wind turbines with new ones so Germany can \"increase the electricity increase the electricity yield at existing sites without interfering with nature.\" The country's post-communist Left Party wants to continue to develop renewables, including wind, but to ensure public ownership.\nIncreasing the share of renewable energy in electricity generation could help to bring down energy prices in Germany, which are among the highest in the world. Schill pointed out that wind power plays such a significant role in climate neutrality plans, \"precisely because it is cheap.\"\nA July 2024 study by the Fraunhofer Institute which calculated\u00a0the average cost of electricity generation over a power plant's lifetime\u00a0showed a marked difference between renewables and conventional power plants in Germany.\nThe costs for varying kinds of solar and wind power were at the lower end of the scale, ranging from \u20ac0.041 to \u20ac0.225 ($0.04\u00a0to $0.23) per kilowatt hour. Gas, coal and nuclear power tended to be higher, costing anywhere from \u20ac0.109 to \u20ac0.49 per kilowatt hour \u2014 with nuclear being the most expensive.\nTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video\nEnergy costs were also a key point in Weidel's opposition to renewable energy. In her interview with ZDF, she emphasized the burden that wind was placing on the German economy, saying \"our companies are no longer competitive due to high energy prices.\"\n\"There is no relevant future energy scenario that I know of that would not rely on a mix of [solar] and wind power,\" said Schill. And the renewables sector is itself a boost to the economy, as Kerstin Andreae, a former Greens lawmaker and chair of the German Association of Energy and Water Industries, said earlier this week.\n\"Wind power is not only a means of climate protection, but also contributes to economic stability by creating jobs and promoting investment,\" she said in a statement on January 13, adding that wind energy had also helped to ensure supply in times of energy shortages brought on by Russia's invasion of Ukraine in 2022.\nAccording to Schill, the fact that many wind turbine\u00a0manufacturers are based in Germany and Europe also gave the industry an edge. \"Unlike other energy technologies, for example photovoltaics, where we are extremely dependent on imports from China, this is not the case with wind power,\" he said. \"From a resilience perspective, wind power has many advantages.\"\nTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video\nThis article was originally published on 17.01.2025 but was updated on 21.01.2025 to include an earlier statement from Friedrich Merz, the conservative CDU party's candidate for chancellor on wind energy, as well as the CDU, BSW, and Left Party positions on renewables and wind energy.\nUpdate 23.01.2025:\u00a0A previous version of this article stated that the cost for solar and wind power was \u20ac0.41.

            "summary": "Germany has made significant strides in reducing its carbon dioxide emissions, achieving its cleanest electricity generation in 2024, with renewable energy comprising 62.7% of the mix. Despite halving emissions from electricity generation since 2014, the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) party aims to halt decarbonization efforts amid a snap election. Analysts stress the need for continued action, as Germany remains a major emitter globally. The country has a moral responsibility to lead in technological innovation for clean energy, with a goal to cut emissions by 65% from 1990 levels by 2030, benefiting both climate and economic interests.",
            "content": "Countries around the world are working to reduce their emissions of planet-heating carbon dioxide. Germany is now responsible for less than 2%, but even that is too much.\nGermany's 2024 electricity generation was its \"cleanest ever,\"\u00a0with renewable energy accounting for 62.7% of the mix, according to new research.\nThis shift, which is thanks to an uptick in green energy and decline in coal-based power, is part of a longer trend that has seen Germany halve its emissions from electricity generation since 2014.\nReductions have been achieved across many sectors despite differing political perspectives on how to make energy greener, according to Andreas L\u00f6schel, an environmental economist at Ruhr University Bochum.\n\"There was never a questioning of the general theme of the energy transition. That was supported by all parties over three decades now, which I think is quite unique and it reflects the general dedication of the German population,\"\u00a0said L\u00f6schel, who is also chairman of the expert commission on monitoring the government's energy transition.\nAs Germany prepares for a snap election in February, however, that is changing. Second in the polls, the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) says it would end efforts toward\u00a0decarbonization and plans for carbon neutrality within the next two decades.\nWith the country's established parties currently refusing to consider forming a coalition government with the AfD, it's unlikely that the party will make it into power.\nNevertheless, Germany's reduction of planet-heating greenhouse gas emissions stagnated somewhat last year. Though they fell by 3% to reach a historic low, the decline was considerably slower than the 10% drop of 2023.\nIn 2022, Germany was responsible for around 1.75% of global carbon dioxide emissions. By comparison, the world's biggest emitter, China, accounted for just under a third of CO2 spewed into the atmosphere in the same year. Roughly another third was made up of countries producing more than 2%, like the United States, which was responsible for around 13%.\n\"The final third is completely made up of countries that have less than 2% of the world's emissions,\"\u00a0said Hannah Ritchie, deputy editor and lead researcher at the Oxford University-affiliated scientific platform Our World in Data. \"All of the small emitters combined add up to more than China emits.\"\nShe said that is one of the reasons why even relatively low-emitting industrialized countries like Germany\u00a0need to continue working to decarbonize.\u00a0\"Even at a fundamental mathematics level, this doesn't work if we don't take action.\"\nAnd despite the progress Germany has made thus far, it remains among the 10 biggest emitters globally. Home to just over 1% of the world's population, Germany's residents emitted an average of around 7.1 tons per person in 2023, well over the world average of 4.7 tons.\nTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video\nAnalysts also argue that being one of the first countries to industrialize, Germany has a duty to clean up its act. At its peak in the late 1800s, the country was responsible for around 17% of global carbon emissions.\n\"Our historical emissions are much larger than our emissions today. That has brought us much higher standards of living,\" said Ritchie.\nAnd because CO2 can remain in the atmosphere for between 300 and 1,000 years, emissions from the industrialization of countries such as Germany, the UK and France are still warming the planet today, affecting lives in distant places.\nWorld Weather Attribution (WWA), an international organization that tracks the link between global warming and extreme weather, found that climate change had contributed to 26 events they studied in 2024. These were connected to the deaths of at least 3,700 people and the displacement of millions more.\nExtreme weather events studied by the organization included heat waves in Asia and Europe, extreme rainfall in India, Afghanistan, Iran, Pakistan and Spain, drought in South America and Italy,\u00a0wildfires in Brazil and Chile\u00a0and storms in the United States and the Philippines, among others.\nCountries in the Global South, those that have not yet industrialized by burning fossil fuels and so are least responsible for the climate crisis, are being the hardest hit by extreme weather events.\n\"We have contributed to this problem of global climate change,\" said Ritchie. \"Therefore, there is a moral responsibility lens there by which we should try to use our wealth and our high standards of living to reduce our emissions.\"\nIn the early 2000s, Germany used its wealth to pioneer what was then a new technology to drive down emissions, using government subsidies to incentivize an uptake in solar power.\n\"Without German policies on renewables, we would not have seen solar technology being used worldwide and being a big success factor, a development factor, for many countries in the world,\" L\u00f6schel\u00a0told DW.\nHe added that Europe's largest economy should also continue to focus on cutting its emissions to promote innovation in clean technologies elsewhere.\n\"We have to show that it's possible to have an industrialized country that is able to keep up with the climate challenges and develop technologies, develop system solutions that demonstrate that this is not going to be a reason for economic decline, for loss of competitiveness,\" he said.\nUnder current national legislation, Germany is obliged to reduce its emissions by 65% from 1990 levels by 2030. As well as helping the country meet its climate targets, David Ryfisch, head of future-proof finance at environment and rights NGO Germanwatch, said a forward-looking approach will also serve other national interests.\n\"We see that renewable energy, especially wind and solar, we see that batteries, electrolyzers, etc., they're all following the same paths of technology that have been successful in history, so it's very likely that these technologies will succeed,\" he said.\n\"It is in Germany's interest to invest in the\u00a0technologies necessary for the transformation and become global leaders in this to have a competitive edge.\"\nEdited by: Tamsin Walker",

Therefore when he says \"we did it in Romania\" (we annulled the Romanian presidential election), he means \"we\" in a generic sense (\"we Europeans\", not \"we the powers of EU\"), as in \"we\" he can only be a regular citizen, not a person of power.His implication isn't \"if AfD wins\", but \"if Elon uses Twitter to influence the election\", like an unidentified power (most likely Russia) used TikTok to manipulate the Romanian election. Breton implies there was backstage discussion that lead to the Romanian election being annulled. It is reasonable to expect that important decisions are discussed before decisions are made, so I'm not shocked that the Romanian leadership discussed the topic with EU counterparts.Now the thing is Elon used Twitter/X to support AfD in next German elections. (At least, contrary to the TikTok case, he does it in the clear.) It was said (chancellor Scholz) that Elon is in his right to give his opinions. Breton seems to be opposite opinion. My opinion is that if Elon gets an official position in the new US administration, his words might start to be considered interference from a foreign power. Romania suspended TikTok on that ground, maybe we can get a combo with Twitter in Germany.\n\n\nParent Share\n\ntwitter\nfacebook\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRe:\n (Score:2)\n\n\nby test321 ( 8891681 ) writes:\n\n\n\n\nThanks for the correction; The Romanian regulation agency ANCOM *requested* the suspension, but it has not yet been accepted.* The previous source was Visegr\u00e1d 24, a well known disinformation account on twitter https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/...

What I wonder is if Germany's energy policies are driving up prices.  I may have found my answer in the fine article.

On that score, Merz looks to be wobbling a bit. Though his Christian Democrats still lead the field with about 30%, some polls suggest support for the centre right might be softening, while the far right is strengthening.\nThough the EPP is already the strongest political family in Europe, returning Germany, the EU's dominant force, to its column would be major boost.\nUnderscoring just how important Germany is to the group, nine EPP heads of state and government as well as European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen travelled to Berlin to offer their support.

With Weber, a Bavarian, in charge, they remain firmly in control of the EPP's operations as well.\nEven so, the Christian Democrats' narrow loss in Germany's 2021 election relegated the party to the opposition benches and diluted their influence. Without the chancellery, the Christian Democrats no longer sported the most consequential players\u00a0in negotiations over top EU jobs last summer, for example.\nThat is about to change.\nThe EPP\u2019s messaging in Berlin made it clear that the CDU will return in the driver\u2019s seat, if Merz becomes chancellor.\nThe two policy manifestos that the leaders signed off on largely read like they were plugged from the CDU\u2019s election manifesto.

There is no way to fix this, most likely\u201d, the centre-right CDU leader said this week at a meeting with a conservative workers\u2019 union.\nChances of reactivation were \u201clower by the week\u201d, Merz added.\nGermany decommissioned its last three operating nuclear power plants in April 2023, following a 2011 decision by then-chancellor and fellow CDU member Angela Merkel.\nDespite accepting that the country's nuclear phaseout is now a done deal, Merz this week called the original decision to exit the technology a \u201cgrave strategic mistake\u201d.\nMerz's concession that nuclear is likely dead in Germany comes despite a promise in his party's election manifesto to examine \u201cthe possibility of restarting operations at the nuclear power plants that were recently shut down.\u201d\nThe manifesto also alludes to \"research into fourth and fifth generation nuclear energy, small modular reactors and fusion power plants.\" While this would appear to leave a glimmer of hope for Germany's nuclear advocates, the probability of such technologies ever becoming viable for energy generation is unclear.\nThe party has not commented on whether it has shifted its position following Merz\u2019s remarks.\nNuclear 'ideological' politics\nGermany's exit from nuclear has been politically fraught, especially as a planned closure of the country's last remaining plants coincided with the 2022 energy crisis. Chancellor Olaf Scholz ultimately ordered the remaining three nuclear power stations to keep running for four more months during the 2022/23 winter.\nSince then, politicians have traded accusations on who should have done what.\nIn 2024 a conservative-established parliamentary committee investigated accusations that Economy Minister Robert Habeck, a member of the Green party, pressed ahead with the final shut down based on green \u201cideology\u201d, and with disregard for the country\u2019s energy security.\nScientists\u00a0and plant operators\u00a0 weighed in during those deliberations, stating that it would be \"unrealistic\" to put existing power stations back into operation, and arguing that the construction of new plants would take more than a decade and come at great expense.\nWhile internal written exchanges from the ministry\u2019s internal communication proved controversial, scientists and operators concluded the plants\u2019 decommissioning had never put Germany\u2019s energy security in danger.\nHabeck told the committee that his ministry had worked \u201cwithout a pre-determining outcome based on ideology\u201d.\n[Edited by DC/OM]\nUpdated: \n 20-01-2025\nEU ministers mull new German plan to reinforce asylum rules\nLead MEPs\u2019 pitch for climate tracking group stalls\nOperation SHIELD seizes drugs worth more than \u20ac11 million\nMEPs grill Commissioners on Mercosur money pots\n\u2018No control\u2019: Sweden grapples with bomb violence wave\nECB further cuts interest rates amid Trump tariff fears\nNorway\u2019s governing coalition breaks over EU energy rules row\nMutual defence applies in space, says Kallas\nEurozone unexpectedly stagnates as German, French economies contract\nEIB to up defence investment to \u20ac2bn this year\nLead MEPs\u2019 pitch for climate tracking group stalls\n30/01/2025\n2 min. read\nBrussels kicks off \u2018too late\u2019 meetings to boost flagging heat pump industry\n30/01/2025\n2 min. read\nCommission to meet car industry half-way on green targets\n29/01/2025\n1 min. read\nGermans would rather shiver than pay more for heat\n27/01/2025\n3 min. read\nEurope doesn\u2019t need US gas, but might buy it anyway\n27/01/2025\n6 min. read\nFearing Trump tariffs, German carmakers burnish their US links\n20/01/2025\n3 min. read",

            "content": "Conservative chancellor candidate Friedrich Merz railed against the climate policies of the left-leaning parties he\u2019ll likely have to govern with.\nThis article is also available in: French\nBERLIN \u2014 Germany's likely next chancellor, Friedrich Merz, has vowed to restore Germany\u2019s industrial competitiveness by putting climate policies on the back burner.\nGermany\u2019s economic policies have been \u201calmost exclusively geared toward climate protection\u201d during the reign of Chancellor Olaf Scholz, Merz said during a campaign speech in the western industrial city of Bochum on Monday. \u201cI want to say it clearly as I mean it: We will and we must change that.\u201d\nGermany\u2019s left-leaning coalition government, which collapsed in November over persistent rifts on spending and economic reforms, committed to \u201cideally\u201d phasing out coal by 2030, eight years before the official target date. In order to meet that goal, the coalition \u2014 which included Scholz\u2019s Social Democratic Party and the Greens \u2014 massively expanded renewable energies and subsidized energy-intensive companies to help them achieve climate neutrality.\nGermany, as a result, is the European Union's industrial leader in producing green infrastructure, having the most facilities for producing solar and wind technology. It has the second-most facilities for making of heat pumps, trailing Italy.\nMerz, however, suggested he would radically change course.\n\u201cIn recent years, we have agreed often enough on which [energy resource] we will phase out,\u201d he said during his speech, mentioning both coal and nuclear energy. \u201cBut as long as we don't have a replacement, decommissioning what we have is out of the question. If we continue to do this, we will massively jeopardize Germany as an industrial location, and we are not prepared to do that.\u201d\nFor more polling data from across Europe visit  POLITICO Poll of Polls.\nMerz and his conservative alliance are polling at 31 percent support, putting them in pole position to lead Germany\u2019s next coalition government after the country\u2019s Feb. 23 election. The far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) party is polling second with 21 percent support.\nThe problem for Merz is that, given the AfD\u2019s strength, his conservatives are almost certain to have to govern with the SPD or the Greens, the parties that pushed the policies he\u2019s railing against. Merz has ruled out a coalition with the AfD.\nDuring his Bochum visit, Merz also expressed skepticism of the previous government\u2019s focus on \u201cgreen steel,\u201d steelworks powered by hydrogen derived from renewable power, saying in a panel discussion that he does not \"believe that the rapid switch to hydrogen-powered steelworks will be successful.\"\nThyssenKrupp, the erstwhile national steel champion, received about \u20ac2 billion in government subsidies in 2023 to speed its transformation away from CO2-emitting production by replacing coal-fired steel furnaces with new ones powered by hydrogen.\nIn Bochum, Merz suggested he'd bet on carbon capture to mitigate emissions generated from steelworks instead of seeking to avoid them completely with hydrogen.\nMerz\u2019s central concern about hydrogen made from renewables is cost. But\u00a0experts warn that\u00a0carbon capture, an electricity-hungry technology, also comes with a hefty price tag and is not yet available at the scale needed to decarbonize the steel sector.\nRobert Habeck, the chancellor candidate for the Greens, pushed back against Merz\u2019s comments on hydrogen-powered steelworks.\n\u201cNobody should believe that steel produced with coal-fired power and coal energy still has a chance on the world market,\u201d Habeck told reporters on Tuesday.\nSPD leaders also criticized Merz.\n\u201cAnyone who wants to dial back now will destroy billion-euro investments and tens of thousands of jobs,\u201d Anke Rehlinger, the premier of the southwestern state of Saarland, where the steel industry is a key sector, told German outlet Stern.\nZia Weise, Rasmus Buchsteiner and Chris Lunday contributed reporting.\nGermany\u2019s likely next chancellor wants tougher migration measures even with far-right support, triggering a backlash ahead of a national election.\n\u201cAcknowledgement of the dark past of the country\u201d is vital, says the chair of Israel\u2019s Holocaust remembrance center.\nThe proposals are to be discussed during next week\u2019s meeting of EU foreign ministers.\nChancellor Olaf Scholz\u2019s latest demand is likely to stall a \u20ac3 billion aid package to the war-ravaged country as Russian forces continue their advance.",

The figure exceeds the NATO members\u2019 target spending, which currently stands at 2% of a nation\u2019s GDP.\nThe economy minister justified his demand by pointing to a threat supposedly posed by Moscow. \u201cWe need to spend almost twice as much on our defense so that [Russian President Vladimir] Putin does not dare to attack us. We must secure peace and prevent further war,\u201d Habeck told Der Spiegel.\nPutin has repeatedly stated that Russia has no plans to attack any member of the US-led military bloc. He nonetheless warned NATO of a potential risk of a direct confrontation with Moscow due to the bloc\u2019s ever-increasing involvement in the ongoing Ukraine conflict, where its members provided financial and military aid to Kiev, including supplying it with long-range weapons the Ukrainian forces used to strike Russia\u2019s internationally recognized territory.\nTalking to Stern magazine on Tuesday, Scholz criticized Habeck\u2019s proposal as too vague. \u201cThe idea seems somewhat half-baked to me,\u201d he said, adding that the economy minister essentially suggested \u201calmost doubling the defense budget from just under \u20ac80 billion ($82.76 billion) to \u20ac140 billion ($144.83 billion) without saying what the money will be spent on and where it will come from.\u201d\n\u201cWho will pay the bill? The citizens?\u201d the chancellor asked. According to the NATO data, cited by the German dpa news agency last week, Germany reported defense spending amounting to \u20ac90.6 billion ($93.3 billion) for the coming year. That is slightly above its 2% of GDP spending threshold.\nThe target has been met with the help of a \u20ac100 billion special debt-financed fund created by Scholz\u2019s government back in 2022, in the wake of the start of Russia\u2019s military campaign against Kiev, dpa reported. According to the news agency, the fund is to be spent by the end of 2027.\nGermany is also one of the biggest donors of military aid to Kiev, second only to the US. Berlin has spent around \u20ac11 billion ($11.38 billion) between January 2022 and October 2024 on military assistance to Ukraine, according to the Kiel Institute for the World Economy.\nRT News App\n\u00a9 Autonomous Nonprofit Organization \u201cTV-Novosti\u201d, 2005\u20132025.

One other NATO member, however, has welcomed the incoming US president's suggestion.\nGerman Chancellor Olaf Scholz has dismissed demands from US President-elect Donald Trump that Germany and other NATO allies increase defense spending to at least 5% of gross domestic product (GDP).\n\"Five percent would be over \u20ac200 billion ($204 billion) per year \u2014 the federal budget is not even \u20ac500 billion,\" Scholz said at a\u00a0campaign event in the western German city of Bielefeld on Monday.\n\"That would only be possible with massive tax increases or massive cuts to many things that are important to us,\" he said, insisting that he would not countenance cuts to pensions, local government or transport infrastructure.\nGermany only reached the current NATO target of 2% of GDP last year, the first time it had done so since the end of the Cold War, and Scholz promised that the country would maintain that level.\n\"I guarantee that we will continue to spend 2% of our economic output on defense,\" he said. \"Anyone who says that's not the way to go must also say where the [extra] money will come from.\"\nTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video\nDuring his famous \"Zeitenwende\" (historical turning point) speech to the German parliament in February 2022 in the immediate aftermath of Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine, Scholz announced a \u20ac100bn special fund for Germany's own underfunded and underequipped armed forces, known as the Bundeswehr.\nBut German defense expenditure remains restricted by a tight budget situation and strict constitutional rules regarding deficit spending.\nNevertheless, German Defense Minister Boris Pistorius contradicted Scholz somewhat by saying that military spending should increase.\n\"Increasing the war capability of the Bundeswehr in the coming years is the top priority of the hour,\" he said in the central German city of Kassel, where he was handing over the first of dozens of advanced new German-built howitzers to Ukraine.\nPistorius, of Scholz's Social Democratic Party (SPD), has been topping polls as one of the most popular German politicians and was recently tipped to replace Scholz as the party's chancellor candidate for February's snap elections, but withdrew.\n\"We will continue on this path in 2025,\" he continued. \"And we know that in the following years, we will have to invest even more in our security. Two percent can only be the beginning. It will have to be significantly more if we want to continue at the pace and to the extent that we have to.\"\nOther key NATO figures have also expressed tacit support for Trump's suggestion, even if 5% may not be feasible in the immediate term.\nIn an interview with the British Financial Times newspaper, published on Mondy, Polish Defense Minister Wladyslaw Kosiniak-Kamysz said Trump's demands were an \"important wake-up call\" for NATO members.\n\"He should not be criticized for setting a really ambitious target because otherwise there will be some countries that will continue to debate whether more spending is really needed,\" he said.\nPoland is NATO's biggest contributor in terms of relative defense spending, committing around 4.2% of GDP to its military in 2024, a figure which Warsaw intends to increase to 4.7% in 2026. The United States itself \"only\" spends around 3.37% of GDP on defense.\nOther leading contributors include the Baltic States Estonia (3.43%), Latvia (3.15%) and Lithuania (2.85%) and Finland (2.41%) which, like Poland, share borders either with Russia, Russian exclave Kaliningrad or Russian ally Belarus.\nTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video\nmf/lo (dpa, AFP)",

They are a group with one big priority: pensions.\nWith their backs against the wall, the Social Democrats have resorted to outright pension alarmism, accusing the rival Christian Democrats (now polling at about 30%, compared to the SPD\u2019s 15%) of planning to cut pensions, while casting themselves as defenders of the elderly.\nDuring his acceptance speech for his party nomination earlier this month, Scholz warned, without offering evidence, of \u201cbitter cuts\u201d to health care and pensions, two red-letter issues for retirees.\nThe CDU quickly denied such plans, in part because they\u2019re just as dependent on the elderly as the SPD.\nPensioners, and those who will retire soon, are not only a growing voter group but also the last bastion of Germany\u2019s traditional Volksparteien \u2013 the centre-left SPD and centre-right CDU \u2013 whose voters are ageing even faster than the overall population.\nIt\u2019s no coincidence that the two parties\u2019 lead candidates, Scholz, 66, and the CDU\u2019s Friedrich Merz, 69, are themselves ripe for retirement.\nIn the last election in 2021, the Christian Democrats and SPD scored a combined result of 73% of voters of 70 or older, while only reaching a combined 25% among young voters of ages 18 to 24.\n\u20ac500 billion price tag\nScholz wants to fix the level of state pensions at 48% of average earnings, a level many analysts say is unsustainable if Germany doesn\u2019t lift its retirement age, which is currently at 67.\nWhile cuts of pensions at face value are ruled out in Germany by law, Scholz warns that in \u2018real\u2019 terms, adjusted for purchasing power, pensions could nevertheless fall if his reform is not adopted. Without such a reform, the legal guarantee will end in July 2025.\nBut Scholz\u2019s plan comes with a huge price tag, particularly for the young generation. Until 2045, a stabilisation of the pension level would come with additional costs totalling \u20ac500 billion, the German court of auditors reckons.\nGiven the rising number of pensioners, while the working population paying into the system will stagnate, employees and employers will shoulder most of this through rising contributions, on top of the\u00a0already increasing\u00a0contributions for public health insurance.\nThis would lead to \u201csignificant additional burdens for employees and higher labour costs for companies,\u201d the court of auditors warns.\nThere is no discussion of extending a second legal guarantee, also expiring this year, which limits pension contributions to a maximum of 20% of gross income.\nIn addition, Scholz\u2019s proposal would mean increasing costs for the federal budget.\nPresently, over \u20ac110 billion is transferred from the federal budget to the pension system each year, as it can no longer be financed by contributions alone.\nWith Scholz\u2019s plan, those payments would increase even further, despite the country\u2019s huge other spending needs, such as investments into its crumbling infrastructure or rising defence spending.\nNo wonder, then, that people lose trust in the system.\nSPD co-leader Saskia Esken was recently laughed at by the audience of a TV talk show when she denied a journalist\u2019s claim that the pension system becomes unaffordable.\nIt was probably moments like this that Clemens Fuest, head of the influential Ifo Institute, had in mind when\u00a0he warned last week that German politicians appear to be \u201cafraid of the voter\u201d and not willing to honestly discuss the country\u2019s economic problems.\nCentre-right shies away\nEven conservative Christian Democrats, who like to present themselves as tellers of difficult truths, shy from major debates around pensions.\nWhile opposing Scholz\u2019s proposal to anchor the pension threshold in law, the centre-right nevertheless hopes for \u201ca stable pension level guaranteed by economic growth.\u201d\nThough the Christian Democrats have previously advocated coupling the retirement age to the rising life expectancy, they have gone quiet on the question more recently.\nWhen asked how to tackle the financial woes of the federal budget, Christian Democrats prefer to talk about unemployment benefits \u2013 reformed by the last government \u2013 rather than pensions.\nBut the costs for the federal government for unemployment benefits are less than a quarter of the annual grant to the pension system, and even drastic cuts there would not suffice to finance the CDU/CSU\u2019s wish list, such as corporate tax cuts or higher military spending.\nCompared with 21\u00a0million pensioners, the five million unemployed seem to be an easier target, however \u2013 certainly coming with a lower risk of losing a core constituency.\nEU ministers mull new German plan to reinforce asylum rules\nLead MEPs\u2019 pitch for climate tracking group stalls\nOperation SHIELD seizes drugs worth more than \u20ac11 million\nMEPs grill Commissioners on Mercosur money pots\n\u2018No control\u2019: Sweden grapples with bomb violence wave\nECB further cuts interest rates amid Trump tariff fears\nNorway\u2019s governing coalition breaks over EU energy rules row\nMutual defence applies in space, says Kallas\nEurozone unexpectedly stagnates as German, French economies contract\nEIB to up defence investment to \u20ac2bn this year\nECB further cuts interest rates amid Trump tariff fears\n30/01/2025\n2 min. read\nEurozone unexpectedly stagnates as German, French economies contract\n30/01/2025\n2 min. read\nUnions reject EU competitiveness plan\n30/01/2025\n3 min. read\nGerman businesses fed up with outgoing government\n30/01/2025\n3 min. read\nWhat\u2019s behind Europe\u2019s car industry crisis\n30/01/2025\n5 min. read\nWhat auto crisis?

But in 2021, amid the inflationary pressure following the COVID pandemic, it had stood at 3.3 million.\nBack in 2013, only 2.4 million were at risk of poverty, with Eurostat's definition of this being if a pensioner's total income, including benefits, is less than 60% of the national median income.\nHowever, demographic changes in Germany and its aging population play a significant role in this increase, with the pensioner population increasing by more than 50% since 1991, from 12 million to 18.7 million by 2022.\nTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video\n\"Pensioner poverty even affects the middle class in the meantime,\" Wagenknecht, who formally split from the socialist Left Party and formed the new party in January,\u00a0told dpa on Saturday.\nShe claimed that neither Chancellor Olaf Scholz, also a former finance minister, nor his CDU challenger Friedrich Merz had an answer to the issue.\nWith a view to snap elections in February in Germany, Wagenknecht said good pensions were a \"focal point\" for her BSW.\nHer party frequently addresses such issues. Last month, it requested data from the German statistical office on the number of individuals aged 65 and over who required welfare payments to supplement their pensions in Germany.\nAlmost 730,000 people did so in the second quarter of 2024, Destatis found, again with a fairly sharp rise over the last 10 or so years amid the expanding pensioner population.\nWagenknecht also appeared in the publications of Germany's RND newspaper group on Saturday, again arguing for action to reduce living costs.\nIn this case, she was calling for more legislation in the Bundestag before February's elections, but this time not from the remaining minority government but rather led by the opposition.\nTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video\nShe said there would be a parliamentary majority to repeal contentious\u00a0new laws on heating prices implemented earlier in the government's term.\nShe called the heating legislation one of the \"most illogical and in the long term expensive for citizens\" of the past three years.\n\"It doesn't protect the climate, but rather stands for the imposition of the state, wanting to govern right the way into our citizens' heating cellars,\" she told the newspapers.\nWagenknecht and the BSW are also\u00a0 strapped for cash themselves,\u00a0particularly now that the election date has been brought forward.\nWhile the new party would in theory now qualify for state campaign funding assistance for the next federal elections, having secured representation in the European Parliament and some state parliaments since its formation in January, party officials say the funds won't practically be available until 2025 and will therefore not flow in time.\nParty treasurer Ralph Suikat said on Friday that the BSW was seeking either donations from supporters, which it says it would repay in 2025, or if necessary more formal loans. Wagenknecht also said the campaign financing issue\u00a0was posing \"certain challenges.\"\nmsh/lo (dpa, AFP, epd)\nWhile you're here: Every Tuesday, DW editors round up what is happening in German politics and society.

Both developments showed that much is at stake for Germany, he said.\n\u201cThese are times in which people are dreaming of shredding everything to pieces with a chainsaw \u2014 democracy, the welfare state, equal rights,\u201d Scholz said. \u201cTimes in which certain forces in America are also working very specifically to destroy our democratic institutions in the West.\u201d\nThe SPD party congress on Saturday formally nominated Scholz as their top candidate and adopted the party\u2019s election program.\nScholz, 66, said Trump\u2019s recent expansionist rhetoric against Greenland and Canada, as well as the Panama Canal, give him cause for concern.\n\u201cThe principle of inviolability of borders applies to every country,\u201d Scholz said to loud applause. \u201cNo country is the backyard of another.

I\u2019m telling you: The bill will be paid by the ordinary people in this country,\u201d Scholz said. \u201cThey will have to accept bitter cuts in public pensions and care.\u201d\nMerz defended his party\u2019s proposals, though, by arguing that a revival of economic growth would lead to higher tax revenues, despite lower income tax. A 40% corporate tax in a declining economy will bring less profit than a 25% corporate tax in a growing economy, he said.\nThe chancellor triggered the early election by firing his finance minister in early November in a dispute over more debt-financed government spending for Ukraine, effectively stripping himself of a majority in the lower house of parliament.\nWith little more than six weeks until the vote, Merz\u2019s party has a comfortable lead in opinion polls, with the far-right, anti-migration AfD party polling in second place and Scholz\u2019s SPD trailing in third.\nThe center-right CDU/CSU bloc has about 31% support, according to the latest Bloomberg average of recent surveys, with the AfD at about 20%, the SPD 17% and the Greens 12% in fourth.\nA new poll commissioned by the public broadcaster ZDF, though, showed the SPD sliding into fourth place, behind the Greens.\nThe election campaign took an unexpected turn recently when Elon Musk, the world\u2019s wealthiest person and a key Trump donor and ally, waded in on behalf of the AfD. Musk on the X social media platform he owns disparaged Scholz as an \u201cincompetent fool,\u201d and German President Frank-Walter Steinmeier as an \u201canti-democratic tyrant.\u201d\nMusk spoke at length on Thursday with AfD candidate Weidel on X, in what amounted to free advertising with the potential to reach millions of voters.\nSince it was founded in 2013, the AfD has moved progressively toward the extreme right, garnering support among voters disillusioned with mainstream parties, particularly in Germany\u2019s former communist eastern regions.\nThe AfD officially nominated Weidel as the party\u2019s chancellor candidate at a convention in the Saxony town of Riesa, northwest of Dresden. The meeting started about two hours late amid massive protests against the right-wing party; about 10,000 demonstrators tried to prevent delegates from reaching the venue.\nWeidel called in her speech for a complete closure of Germany\u2019s borders and promised to deport people who\u2019d entered illegally. There will be a \u201cclear message to the whole world,\u201d the 45-year-old said. Co-party leader Tino Chrupalla called Weidel \u201cthe future chancellor\u201d.\nThe AfD also calls for a German exit from the European Union and the euro zone, moves which would unwind decades of political and economic integration.\n\u2014With assistance from Angela Cullen.\n(Updates with AfD co-leader Alice Weidel in second to last paragraph)\nPostmedia is committed to maintaining a lively but civil forum for discussion.

[Kay Nietfeld/picture alliance via Getty Images]\nLanguages: Fran\u00e7aisPrint Email Reddit Facebook  LinkedIn WhatsApp Telegram\nPrint Email Reddit Facebook  LinkedIn WhatsApp Telegram\nBERLIN \u2013 Not even Robert Habeck can escape the Green Party's ghosts of elections past.\nJust as the party's image was beginning to show a glimmer of\u00a0recovery from three disastrous years in government, the Greens' final-stretch curse caught up with Habeck, the eco-party's charismatic frontman and darling of the country's Bobo elite.\nRecent missteps suggest that the party could struggle to rise above the 14% threshold where it has hovered in for months and make it a\u00a0long shot to join Germany's next coalition.\nAt the party's convention here, Habeck gladly accepted the opportunity to divert attention from his unforced errors and dwell on centre-right leader Friedrich Merz's headline-grabbing flirtation with the far right, which critics see as the beginning of the end of Germany's cordon sanitaire.\nThough Habeck's remarks \u2013 including his repeated calls for \"confidence\" \u2013 went down well with the party faithful, it's far from certain the rest of the country, still reeling from the latest murderous attack by a rejected asylum seeker, was paying attention.\nOld-fashioned sex scandal\nThe Greens' latest trouble began with Habeck's surprising proposal a couple of weeks ago to deduct social security contributions from capital gains, a suggestion that was met with widespread derision and ridicule. Exactly why Habeck, Germany's vice chancellor and economy minister, thought it would be a good idea to scare off any German who has savings invested in the markets in the final campaign stretch is anyone's guess.\nBut that was only the overture. What happened next would be best described as an old-fashioned sex scandal turned smear campaign, one that achieved 'political affair' status in record time.\nThe man at the centre of the furore, Stefan Gelbhaar, a Green MP from Berlin, faced anonymous allegations of sexual harassment in December that prompted the party to force him off of its list of candidates for the upcoming national election. The party was responding, in part, to media pressure following a report on the allegations on public television.\nThen, two weeks ago, the public broadcaster withdrew its story after discovering that one of Gelbhaar's supposed victims didn't exist and appeared to have been fabricated by an official in Green's local chapter in Berlin.\nThe smoking gun:\u00a0Habeck's campaign manager, Andreas Audretsch, had taken Gelbhaar\u2019s promising slot on the list, all but ensuring him a coveted MP post after the election.\nWhile there's no evidence that either Habeck or Audretsch had anything to do with the matter, the optics are less than ideal.\nA very Green scandal\nUnfortunately for Habeck, the Greens' clumsy attempts at damage control have only made matters worse. Annalena Baerbock, Germany\u2019s Green foreign minister, refused to comment on the affair, and then Habeck\u2019s team tried to bar reporters from asking him about it in an interview.\nWorst of all for the Greens, the case has damaged the party's credibility on one of its defining causes, as Habeck admitted when he broke his silence.\nIt comes as an untimely blow to his efforts to detoxify the party's image after its reputation-smashing stint in Olaf Scholz\u2019s \u2018traffic-light\u2019 coalition.\nDespite his personal popularity \u2013 Habeck's approval rating is higher than that of Merz and Olaf Scholz, the incumbent chancellor \u2013 his missteps as economy minister renewed the Greens' image of being a party of privileged eco-fanatics seeking to impose their lifestyle on everyone else.\nIt was mainly his flagship 'heating law' (legislation that would have forced homeowners to replace fossil-fuel heating systems with pricier heat pumps) that rekindled popular fears about Green excess and precipitated the party's decline in the polls.\nAnd yet, amid Habeck's energetic campaign style, those bad memories seemed to have receded in many voters' minds, sparking a recovery in the polls \u2013 until he rekindled the doubts.\nIt's far from the first time the Greens have shot themselves in the foot in the final stages of the campaign.\u00a0Many in the party still rue the 2013 race, which was sabotaged by a rogue Green proposal to force canteens to introduce a mandatory \"veggie day\" and ban meat from their menus once a week. In schnitzel-loving Germany, the idea went down like a bowl of cold sauerkraut.\nThe Greens are a \u201ctraumatised party\u201d when it comes to their communication with voters, in part because they had the \u2018Veggie Day\u2019 held against them for years, Anton Hofreiter, a leading Green MP, told Euractiv.\nThere were similar problems in 2021, when Baerbock, intermittently tipped to become Germany\u2019s first Green chancellor, ran a botched campaign as the party's standard bearer. It included a plagiarised book, a pimped CV, and verbal slip-ups, to name but a few missteps. \u00a0\u00a0\nHabeck's time to shine\nBack then, Habeck reluctantly yielded the top spot to her after they jointly rebranded the Greens as a pragmatic alternative.\nThis time, it was his turn to make a run for the brass ring.\nThe Greens hoped that Habeck\u2019s eloquence (and what many consider to be his handsome looks) is an asset that could push them past Scholz\u2019s SPD into third place and even into a coalition government with Merz's Christian Democrats.\nFor Habeck, the race represents an opportunity to prove himself: Even if the Greens have no chance of winning, if he succeeds in lifting them out of the doldrums, he would remain the party's dominant figure in the coming years.\nIn a symbolic moment at last year's party conference, Baerbock stood back and applauded as Habeck took to the stage after the Greens confirmed him as their candidate for chancellor.\nAny victory or defeat will be Habeck's.\n'Human'\nHis gimmicky campaign, which involved knock-off Taylor Swift wristbands and kitchen-table talks with voters, resonated in many quarters. The party's polling was nearly back at its record 2021 election result, with Habeck intermittently neck-and-neck with Merz as Germans' preferred chancellor.\nThe one-two punch of the capital-gains proposal (which one newspaper called Habeck\u2019s \u2018Veggie Day moment\u2019) and the Gelbhaar affair have put that progress at risk.\nIf nothing else, Robert Habeck has certainly proven his campaign slogan right. He is only \u201ca human being\u201d.\nLanguages: Fran\u00e7aisPrint Email Reddit Facebook  LinkedIn WhatsApp Telegram\nPrint Email Reddit Facebook  LinkedIn WhatsApp Telegram\nEU ministers mull new German plan to reinforce asylum rules\nLead MEPs\u2019 pitch for climate tracking group stalls\nOperation SHIELD seizes drugs worth more than \u20ac11 million\nMEPs grill Commissioners on Mercosur money pots\n\u2018No control\u2019: Sweden grapples with bomb violence wave\nECB further cuts interest rates amid Trump tariff fears\nNorway\u2019s governing coalition breaks over EU energy rules row\nMutual defence applies in space, says Kallas\nEurozone unexpectedly stagnates as German, French economies contract\nEIB to up defence investment to \u20ac2bn this year\nEU ministers mull new German plan to reinforce asylum rules\n30/01/2025\n3 min. read\n\u2018No control\u2019: Sweden grapples with bomb violence wave\n30/01/2025\n2 min. read\nNorway\u2019s governing coalition breaks over EU energy rules row\n30/01/2025\n2 min. read\nEU ministers mull new German plan to reinforce asylum rules\n30/01/2025\n3 min. read\nGerman lawmakers shout \u201cshame on you\u201d as \u2018firewall\u2019 crumbles\n29/01/2025\n3 min. read\nGermany\u2019s Scholz slams Musk\u2019s \u2018disgusting\u2019 interventions in German politics\n29/01/2025\n2 min. read",

All three members of the now-collapsed coalition had been suffering in the polls amid the public arguments, logjams\u00a0and compromises on policy as they tried to keep the fractious alliance together.\n\"All the disputes, all the compromises that we had to make are now gone. And now the parties are stepping forward with their own ideas. Now a lot can change on all fronts,\" he said.\nFour years ago, Habeck stepped aside to allow Annalena Baerbock, now foreign minister, to take a shot at the top job. She said earlier this year that she wanted to focus on her current post, partly given the fragile geopolitical situation, and that she had no ambition to run again. Habeck then made his intentions clear a few days ago.\nHe explicitly thanked Baerbock when addressing delegates after her on Sunday.\n\"It's a great privilege to know you're ahead of me, by my side and behind me,\" Habeck said to Baerbock.\nBaerbock, meanwhile, lauded Habeck as \"super pragmatic,\" saying he had managed to keep a steady course and free Germany from its dependence on Russian energy imports amid the crisis posed by Moscow's invasion of Ukraine, referring to policies that in some cases have angered parts of the party's ecologist base.\n\"Nobody can handle the rudder like Robert Habeck in a storm and at the same time set the sails correctly in a tailwind,\" she said.\nTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video\nOn Saturday, the opening day of the conference,\u00a0the pro-environment\u00a0party also appointed a new party leadership\u00a0duo: multilingual\u00a0foreign policy specialist Franziska Brantner and 35-year-old Felix Banaszak, a former co-chair of the party's youth wing who only joined the federal parliament after the last election\u00a0in 2021.\nThe Greens briefly led in the polls early in the 2021 campaign, but slipped drastically to finish a distant third, with\u00a014.7% support,\u00a0as Scholz's Social Democrats made a late surge which put them ahead of their traditional rivals, the\u00a0Christian Democrats.\nmsh/dj (AFP, dpa, Reuters)\nWhile you're here: Every Tuesday, DW editors round up what is happening in German politics and society.

Habeck emphasized the need for democratic unity against extremism and the importance of addressing climate change. The Greens also plan to tackle housing shortages and infrastructure issues. The party has gained nearly 10,000 new members since the coalition's breakdown, highlighting its commitment to remain a governing force.",
            "content": "In a show of unity, Germany's Green Party has chosen Robert Habeck as its top candidate and elected new party co-leaders ahead of February's general election. The environmentalists are aiming to remain in government.\nThere was no time for nostalgia or looking back in anger, as\u00a0Germany's Greens pivoted into campaign mode at their weekend party conference in Wiesbaden.\nGermany is expected to elect a new federal parliament on February 23, seven\u00a0months earlier than expected,\u00a0following the collapse of its governing coalition of the Greens, the neoliberal Free Democrats (FDP) and the center-left Social Democrats (SPD), on November 6.\nBut the Greens, a former protest party, do not want to give up hope of being a ruling power as part of a new coalition. Party leaders have spoken of taking responsibility for the country in difficult times \u2014\u00a0even if that may mean having to enter a coalition with the conservatives of the Christian Democrats (CDU) and Christian Social Union (CSU), who are currently far ahead in opinion polls.\nVice Chancellor and Economy Minister Robert Habeck\u00a0was\u00a0elected as the Greens' lead candidate\u00a0on Sunday, with 96% of the vote. In his acceptance speech, Habeck said democracy was threatened by divisions in society, by right-wing extremism and populists. adding that it was yet to be seen what the election of Donald Trump as the new US president would mean for Germany's security. In this dramatic situation, also considering the wars in Ukraine and the Middle East, the Greens were needed more than ever, according to Habeck.\n\"Germany's answer to the growing strength of authoritarian regimes is not more nationalism, rather an alliance of democrats in a European Union which is strong and in touch with its citizens,\" he said in reference to the success of populist parties in Germany.\nTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video\nThe Greens are starting this election campaign with their backs to the wall. They have only about 10-12% of the vote, according to the latest polls.\nIt's not only Habeck, but the party's grassroots members who are determined not to succumb to the temptation to make maximum demands and thereby surely find themselves on the opposition benches.\n\"I see here a party that wants to take responsibility and help shape things,\" Andrea L\u00fcbcke, a delegate from Brandenburg, told DW.\u00a0\"We must show what we have achieved and where we want to go, and, in the end, we must make the people a good offer.\"\nThe Greens overhauled their entire leadership team in Wiesbaden. Several weeks ago, the former co-leaders,\u00a0foreign affairs expert Omid Nouripour and Bundestag lawmaker Ricarda Lang,\u00a0announced their resignation\u00a0in response to hefty defeats in recent elections \u2014 especially\u00a0the European Parliament elections in June, when the Greens' vote share dropped from 20.5% at the 2019 election\u00a0to only 11.9%.\nOn Saturday, the party voted in new co-leaders\u00a0Felix Banaszak, a\u00a0Bundestag legislator from North-Rhine Westphalia, and Franziska Brantner, who served as state secretary in Habeck's Economy Ministry. Banaszak received 93% of delegates' votes, Brantner about 78%.\nBrantner, 45, a\u00a0social scientist, is in Habeck's inner circle. Her election is proof that the Greens' national campaign will be very much tailored around the lead chancellor candidate.\nForeign Minister Annalena Baerbock, the party's top candidate in the 2021 election campaign, expressed interest in keeping her position even after the snap election. The aim is to defend the country and democracy against threats from within and without, above all, right-wing extremists and populists, she told party delegates.\n\"Our responsibility as a progressive party is now, above all, to give security, to protect what is dear and sacred to us,\" she said. Baerbock also claimed that the enemies of democracy, progress and freedom played on people's insecurities by \"badmouthing Germany every day.\"\nGuest speaker Luisa Neubauer, Germany's most well-known climate activist from the Fridays for Future movement, reminded the Greens not to forget their key issue of combating climate change\u00a0in their quest for power.\n\"If you do not honestly and clearly name what is happening in terms of the climate crisis and what still needs to be done in the matter of climate justice, then everyone else will hide behind it.\" she said.\nShe called on Habeck's team to engage in \"a real climate election campaign that nobody else is doing otherwise.\"\nThe Greens also want to address the housing shortage and renew the country's ailing infrastructure. These are all projects the center-left coalition had resolved to do, but could not implement.\nThe Greens have clearly switched into election campaign mode. \"Given the situation in the world, the crises and conflicts, Putin's war of aggression in Ukraine, we would have liked more responsibility for the continuation of this alliance,\" Britta Hasselmann, the Greens'\u00a0parliamentary leader\u00a0in the Bundestag, told DW. \"But now we are looking ahead.\"\nThis sentiment is also driven by the almost 10,000 new members the party has gained since the government broke down on November 6, giving the Greens\u00a0a membership of about 140,000. Despite this, it would be a massive feat of strength for the party of environmental protection to remain part of the government after February 23.\nThis article was originally written in German.\nWhile you're here: Every Tuesday, DW editors round up what is happening in German politics and society.

She also promised to implement harsh immigration policies and scrap green initiatives.\nLast month, the 45-year-old politician also opposed the continued supply of military aid to Ukraine.\nAround the same time, AfD co-leader Tino Chrupalla argued that Germany needed to consider \u201cto what extent [NATO] is still useful for us.\u201d\nThe right-wing party has also suggested holding a referendum on exiting the European Union and the Eurozone.\nRT News App\n\u00a9 Autonomous Nonprofit Organization \u201cTV-Novosti\u201d, 2005\u20132025.

Contrary to Vance's assertions, research shows that areas with high AfD support today, particularly in former East Germany, had significant backing for the Nazi Party in the 1930s. Studies indicate a generational transmission of right-wing tendencies, influenced by socioeconomic factors. The AfD's popularity is connected to historical voting patterns, not a resistance to Nazism.",
            "content": "Has the far-right AfD achieved its greatest electoral successes in the parts of Germany that previously resisted the Nazis? No, it hasn't \u2014 and here's why.\nFirst Elon Musk, now JD Vance. Prominent members of the incoming US government have been lending their support to the German far-right party,\u00a0Alternative for Germany (AfD).\nMusk, the world's richest man, and Vance, the designated US vice president\u00a0to Donald Trump, have both recently made highly polarizing statements.\nVance has criticized US media that described the AfD as being \"Nazi-lite\" because, he wrote on social media on\u00a0January 2, \"the AfD is most popular in the same areas of Germany that were most resistant to the Nazis.\"\nBut is that really true?\nClaim:\u00a0In a post on X (formerly Twitter)\u00a0that has now been accessed more than 7.8\u00a0million times, Vance claimed the\u00a0US media were slandering the AfD.\nDW fact check:\u00a0False. In fact, election results and other research\u00a0indicates\u00a0the opposite is true.\nIt is true that US media, including\u00a0The New York Times\u00a0and even Fox News, have on occasion linked the AfD with Germany's National Socialists, or Nazism. This partly has to do with the fact that\u00a0some AfD politicians have themselves used Nazi slogans. In 2021, AfD member Bj\u00f6rn H\u00f6cke, who formerly worked as a history teacher, was convicted of having publicly used Nazi dictator Adolf Hitler's slogan \"Everything for Germany\" (\"Alles f\u00fcr Deutschland\"), which is banned in Germany today.\nAlice Weidel, the national party's\u00a0co-chair, has said she sees\u00a0May 8, the date on which Germany was freed\u00a0from the Nazis, as the anniversary of the defeat of her country rather than its\u00a0liberation.\u00a0In addition, some state chapters of the AfD as well as its youth organization have been certified as right-wing extremist by a German intelligence service.\nVance has maintained\u00a0that the AfD is popular in regions that put up the most resistance to the Nazis.\nThe AfD is, indeed,\u00a0most popular in states in what was formerly known as East Germany.\u00a0At the last federal election\u00a0in 2021, the AfD was\u00a0victorious in getting locals' second vote in parts of the eastern states of Thuringia, Saxony-Anhalt and Saxony. Second votes are cast for a party, and determine how many seats each party receives in the German lower house, or Bundestag.\nAltogether, the AfD was particularly strong in the so-called \"new\" German states \u2014 that is, states that were formerly part of East Germany \u2014 such as Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania, Brandenburg, Saxony-Anhalt, Saxony and Thuringia. Only in Berlin, also one of the \"new\" states, did it win\u00a0fewer votes.\nIt's a similar picture when one looks at the German results of the European elections in June 2024. Here, too, the AfD was successful mostly in eastern regions. In Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania, Brandenburg, Saxony-Anhalt, Saxony and Thuringia, the AfD gleaned at least 27% of the vote, giving it\u00a0the biggest share\u00a0in those states. In all of Germany, the AfD received 15.9% of votes.\nIn the latest regional elections held in the above states, the AfD was particularly strong.\u00a0In\u00a0Berlin, the Greens were the strongest party at the 2024 European elections (19.6%), while the AfD received 11.6% of votes.\nIn terms of the upcoming\u00a02025 federal election, the AfD is popular but it's hard to know exactly where, because polls tend to document all of Germany and don't look in detail at\u00a0individual regions.\nSo where were the Nazis most popular? And where was most resistance to them\u00a0\u2014 was it in eastern Germany?\nThe party of Adolf Hitler, the National Socialist German Workers' Party (NSDAP), came to power in 1933. In the last Reichstag election before he took power, on November 6, 1932, the NSDAP came out the strongest with 33.1% of the vote.\nIf we look at the election results from German regions in 1932, the NSDAP received the biggest share of the vote in almost all of Germany, including in eastern Germany, in\u00a0the regions where many people vote for the AfD today.\nAt the Reichstag election in March 1933, the NSDAP was even stronger. However, this election is\u00a0described by historians as not free because\u00a0the NSDAP and its supporters intimidated voters, sometimes violently.\nThis is why Vance's claim is wrong. Hitler's NSDAP had Germany-wide support, including in those areas which favor the AfD today.\nAn as-yet unpublished study by researchers at\u00a0Ludwig Maximilian University in Munich, from which some excerpts are already available, has confirmed\u00a0this finding. The study analyzes\u00a0connections between districts in which many vote for the AfD today and those that strongly supported the NSDAP in 1933.\nThere was high voter support in 1933 for the NSDAP in the districts in which the AfD receives strong support today, Felix Hagemeister, a co-author of the study, told DW.\n\"It would be wrong to speak of any causality in this regard,\" he said. According to Hagemeister, it's more about handing down right-wing tendencies from generation to generation. \"There is research showing, for example, that children mostly tend to take on attitudes similar to those of their parents,\" he said.\nIn eastern Germany, this connection between regions in which the NSDAP was strongly supported in the past and the AfD\u00a0today is particularly clear. But it also exists in Rhineland-Palatinate, a state in Germany's west.\nHowever, it's important to exercise caution and not directly compare the voters of today with those alive almost a century ago, wrote\u00a0Christian Booss\u00a0for the\u00a0Federal Agency for Civic Education (bpb).\nHe pointed out that an analysis from 2024 showed\u00a0that the AfD's popularity is also partly determined by socioeconomic differences \u2014 that is,how people\u00a0in certain regions live, and how this leads to\u00a0cultural and ideological differences.\nThis article was originally written in German.\nWhile you're here: Every Tuesday, DW editors round up what is happening in German politics and society.

It does so after a year in which the far-right AfD made striking electoral gains, most worryingly among the young.\nLast year was a good one for the AfD (Alternative f\u00fcr Deutschland). The far-right party, formed in 2013, won 15.9% of the vote in June\u2019s EU election, becoming Germany\u2019s biggest party after the CDU (Christian Democratic Union, 30%). If that seemed impressive, September elections in three eastern states (L\u00e4nder) sent shockwaves through the traditional parties: the AfD amassed 29.2% in Brandenburg \u2013 where the SDP (Social Democratic Party) squeaked in with 30.9% \u2013 and 30.6% in Saxony, just behind the CDU (31.9%). And it took first place in Thuringia (32.8%). This means a far-right party now holds the majority in a German state parliament, something not seen since the second world war. Though a united firewall will prevent it from governing there, it will have a blocking minority that local leader Bj\u00f6rn H\u00f6cke won\u2019t be shy about using.\nEven more concerning, the AfD scored higher with 18-24-year-olds than among the general population in the 2024 local elections (31% in both Saxony and Brandenburg, 38% in Thuringia), which is particularly striking given its radical calls for largescale \u2018remigration\u2019 (removal of immigrants). In June\u2019s European election, 16% of Germans aged 16-24 chose the AfD, just behind the CDU on 17%. The Greens plummeted to 11% \u2013 a far cry from their 33% in 2019, at the height of the Fridays for Future climate movement \u2013 paying the price for their failures and broken promises as part of the Olaf Scholz coalition.\nWhy do East German youth no longer vote red or green, but blue? First, the AfD has an effective youth organisation, Junge Alternative f\u00fcr Deutschland (JA), geared to 14-35-year-olds. Legal independence from its parent has allowed the group to adopt more extreme positions and rhetoric: in 2023 the Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution classified it a \u2018certified rightwing extremist endeavour\u2019.

Despite its stance against multiculturalism, the party has found some success among voters with immigrant backgrounds, such as Ismet Var and Anna Nguyen, who support AfD's focus on economic issues and crime. Recent studies indicate that voting patterns among immigrant voters are becoming similar to those without immigrant backgrounds. The AfD is actively expanding its appeal to these communities, particularly those of Turkish and Russian descent, as part of a broader strategy to increase its voter base in Germany.",
            "content": "The AfD is actively courting voters with an immigrant background while at the same time stirring up anti-immigrant sentiment. Why would any voters with an immigrant background support Germany's far-right party?\nThe Alternative for Germany (AfD) sets out its views on immigrants clearly in its program: \"The AfD views the ideology of multiculturalism as a serious threat to social peace and to the continued existence of the nation as a cultural entity.\"\nAnd yet multiculturalism doesn't appear to be a serious threat to the AfD itself: In the past few months, more and more of the far-right's messaging has been aimed at voters from Germany's many immigrant communities \u2014 with some success.\nBorn in Turkey,\u00a055-year-old Ismet Var has lived in Germany since his childhood, been a German citizen since 1994, and a supporter of the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) since it was founded in 2013.\nVar works as a delivery driver in the German capital, and his work was directly hit by the rise in fuel prices following Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022. Now he can't understand why so much money is being \"thrown away\" on economic and military aid for Ukraine. His main concerns, he says, are that taxes are lowered and criminal immigrants get deported.\nThe latter is already happening \u2014 latest statistics show that Chancellor Olaf Scholz's center-left government increased deportations in the last year. \"Now! Now they're deporting people!\" says Var over a coffee in the international Kreuzberg district of Berlin. \"But they didn't used to.\" He believes that it took the AfD's intervention in the German political scene for the government to act.\nAs an Alevite, he also feels that Germany has become too tolerant of what he calls \"strict Muslims.\" \"I've got nothing against them when they pray at home, but when they do propaganda, then I'm against them,\" he said.\nVar experienced racism as a new arrival in Germany in the 1970s: He remembers a janitor in his building telling him that he and his family wouldn't be there if Hitler were still in power: \"But it didn't bother me. I was little,\" he says.\nAnna Nguyen has also experienced plenty of racism in Germany. Born near Kassel in 1990 to Vietnamese refugees, she is now an AfD representative in the Hesse state parliament. But, she insists, it isn't Germans who are racist towards her \u2014 it is mainly people she thinks are Arabs.\n\"During COVID, it was always people with an immigrant background, presumably Arabs, who shouted 'corona, corona' after me and my Chinese friend,\" she said. \"It's true that on the internet I get flooded with racist comments \u2014 but from the left, even though they call themselves anti-racists.\"\nNguyen insists that her party, meanwhile, is indifferent to race and is not strategically seeking out voters like her. \"It's not about immigrant background,\" she says. \"It's about the fact that all the sensible people in this country want to prevent this green ideological madness. It's about: Can I afford a good life? Is it safe? Do we have a safe electricity supply?\"\nVoters with an\u00a0immigrant background are a demographic reality in Germany: Official statistics from 2023 show that some 12% of the German electorate have a non-German background \u2014 some 7.1 million people. As recently as 2016, some 40% of voters of migrant background voted for the center-left Social Democrats (SPD), and another 28% for the center-right Christian Democratic Union (CDU). But those loyalties appear to have eroded.\nAccording to the German Center for Integration and Migration Research (DeZIM), which is releasing a study on voting habits among migrants at the end of January, there is little difference between voting behavior with or without an immigration background. As late as the general election in 2017, 35% of German Turks voted for the SPD, while 0% voted for the AfD. Now, according DeZIM, immigrant voters don't vote for the AfD any more or less than non-migrant Germans do.\nDeZIM's Jannes Jacobsen, who co-authored the upcoming report, said the AfD appears to be becoming more attractive for people from different backgrounds. He also pointed out that these voters are German citizens \u2014 and see themselves as German. \"So it's maybe not such a big surprise that these people don't vote very differently to people who have no immigrant history,\" he told DW.\nIn 2023, Robert Lambrou, also an AfD state parliamentarian in Hesse, founded an organization named \"With Migration Background for Germany\" for immigrant AfD supporters. The organization's website says it has 137 members from over 30 countries, and that it is open to anyone \"who professes their belief in German culture as the dominant culture and work for the continued existence of the nation as a cultural entity.\"\n\"My experience of the AfD is that it makes no difference whether one is of immigrant background or not,\" the 55-year-old Lambrou, whose father was Greek, told DW. \"I don't see the party as xenophobic \u2014 we want a sensible migration policy.\"\nBut that is hard to square with statements like that of AfD Bundestag member Ren\u00e9 Springer, who, in the wake of revelations early last year that AfD politicians were part of a meeting planning mass \"remigration\" of immigrants and non-white Germans, who wrote on X: \"We will send foreigners back to their home countries. By the million. That isn't a secret plan. That is a promise.\"\nLambrou agreed that some statements are not helpful if they are not properly founded in facts or express important nuances. \"When we notice statements by party members that we don't think are ok, then we try to seek out internal party dialogue,\" he said.\nTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video\nNevertheless, there do appear to be more and more pro-AfD TikTok videos made by non-white people in the past few months.\n\u00d6zg\u00fcr \u00d6zvatan, CEO of the political consultancy Transformakers, and author of an upcoming book on the political impact of Germans of immigration background, said that the AfD has been actively seeking out the attention of immigrant voters for at least the last year \u2014 particularly people with Russian and Turkish roots \u2014 mainly because those communities are more likely to have voting rights. According to Germany's official statistics, there are over 2.9 million people of Turkish background in Germany, of whom nearly 1.6 million have German citizenship. The post-Soviet diaspora, meanwhile, also runs into the millions, and includes several nationalities and ethnicities \u2014 including German. Many of these are also likely to feel attracted to the AfD's pro-Russia\u00a0stance on the Ukraine war.\n\u00d6zvatan argues that this all part of the AfD's larger strategy to expand its voter base. \"Its potential voters in the non-immigrant landscape are of course finite,\" he said. \"They might have a potential vote-share of around 20-25% there \u2014 but if they want to get towards 30-35%, then they need to expand their portfolio, and that will mean creating content and promise policies for immigrant communities.\"\n\"People who immigrated earlier are not automatically in favor of immigration,\" \u00d6zvatan told DW. \"They can be immigrants and hold anti-immigration positions.\"\nNguyen insists that immigrant voters aren't deterred by the racism and contradictions \"because they know who is meant by that \u2014 that's the illegal immigrants, especially those since 2015. It's those that are criminal \u2014 and people of immigration background suffer just as much from those as anyone.\"\n\u00d6zvatan thinks many immigrant voters simply aren't aware of the racist statements, and even when they do hear\u00a0overt racism, they quickly dismiss it as secondary to their main perception of the AfD \u2014 that they don't mean them. \"The main feeling is,\u00a0'they are friendly towards us,'\" he said,\u00a0\"And the AfD tries to engender that feeling.\"\nEdited by Rina Goldenberg\nWhile you're here: Every Tuesday, DW editors round up what is happening in German politics and society.

Lawmakers said the changes were meant to bolster the court\u2019s independence and prevent the judiciary from being hijacked as happened in Germany\u2019s Nazi past.\nThe vote represented a rare point of agreement among political parties in the run-up to the country\u2019s early election. The campaign thus far has been unusually contentious by Germany\u2019s normally staid standards.\nSPD Chancellor Olaf Scholz, in a TV interview this week, referred to his main conservative opponent and frontrunner to become the next chancellor, Friedrich Merz, as \u201cFritz,\u201d a moniker perceived as belittling. Merz\u2019s ally, Bavarian conservative leader Markus S\u00f6der, in turn called Scholz the \u201cmost embarrassing chancellor our country [has] ever had.\u201d\nBut the center-left and center-right parties agreed to put their differences aside to pass the new law. Any future government will now need a two-thirds majority to change the rules governing the court, instead of a simple majority.\nThe AfD is currently polling at 19 percent, well below the strength it would need to pass legislation, and most other parties have refused to work with it. But the Thursday vote expresses the stark fears of lawmakers that the AfD\u2019s influence will only grow.\nAs potentially the largest opposition party in the next parliament, the AfD will benefit from a bigger platform \u2014 but the party\u2019s power will remain limited, largely due to its isolation.\n\u201cThe party will get more visibility through increased speaking time in parliament, and [will] have more money at its disposal,\u201d said Wolfgang Schroeder, a political science professor at the University of Kassel. \u201cBut it won\u2019t be a quantum leap.\u201d\nAfD lawmakers said the new legislation  proved the court was an instrument of the political mainstream.\n\u201cYou are telling an ever-increasing number of voters, citizens of our republic, that this is not their state, that this is not their constitutional court,\u201d said AfD lawmaker Fabian Jacobi in parliament. \u201cWhat you are projecting to the outside world with what you are doing here is an image of our constitutional court as an instrument of power.\u201d\nFormer German Justice Minister Marco Buschmann, who led negotiations on the bill before the collapse of Scholz\u2019s government, repeatedly cited Poland and Hungary as cautionary tales of how populist leaders, once elected, work to erode the strength and independence of the courts.\nThe 16 justices ruling Germany\u2019s constitutional court currently serve 12-year terms.

            "summary": "The article discusses the rise of right-wing, nationalist political movements in Europe, highlighting recent electoral successes in Austria and Germany, as well as support from figures like Elon Musk and Donald Trump. It argues that these parties, while labeled \"anti-globalist,\" often do not challenge the underlying neoliberal structures or U.S. influence in Europe. The focus on immigration and better ties with Russia reflects discontent with economic conditions. The article questions whether these movements will genuinely shift Europe's alignment away from U.S. interests or merely rebrand existing neoliberal policies under a nationalist facade.",
            "content": "There are once again proclamations that the political tide in Europe is turning against the empire, part of an anti-globalist wave toppling governments in Austria and Germany, and even reaching across the Atlantic to sweep away the likes of Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau.\nI\u2019ve lost count how many times I\u2019ve read this prediction. Evidence cited this time in Europe is the collapse of the Austrian government and possible ascendance of\u00a0 the \u201cright wing, pro-Putin\u201d Herbert Kickl, setbacks for the globalists in Croatia elections, as well as billionaire Trump sidekick Elon Musk\u2019s boosting of the Alternative for Germany.\nThe fact that European voters are increasingly choosing candidates that are opposed to Project Ukraine and favor better ties with Russia is surely a good sign. A Musk and Trump spotlight could also make it more difficult for the EU and Commission President Ursula von der Leyen to use \u201ctools\u201d to browbeat governments into submission on the question of Russia or encourage national governments like that of Romania to cancel elections when a candidate favoring better ties with Moscow unexpectedly comes out on top.\nAnd yet one key question remains: will we see a marked difference in the vassalage to the US or simply more of an alignment with the incoming Trump administration?\nI\u2019m\u00a0 not sure the anti-globalist label applies all that well to the political parties making waves in Europe, which are not, after all, opposed to global capital, transatlanticism, or the EU.\nThey are largely a response to the Europe-wide economic downturn driven largely by the disastrous war against Russia. And years of rising immigration combined with low economic growth and austerity have predictably led to improved polling for candidates who are opposed, in theory, to immigration.\nThey are not all that concerned with neoliberalism, oligarchy, transnational capital, or even militarism. They are also not challenging the fact that Europe is reliant on Washington economically, militarily, and for energy.\nAnd so what does that mean for the citizens of Europe?\nFor clues let\u2019s look at one of these \u201canti-globalists\u201d who has been in power for a few years already. She reportedly has Trump\u2019s \u2014 and Musk\u2019s \u2014 ear and is therefore Politico\u2019s most powerful European politician for 2025. Her response to such a designation?\n\u201c\u2026as Spiderman would say, with great power comes great responsibility.\u201d\nThe Melonization of Europe\nMeloni was recently feted at Mar-a-Lago:\nItalian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni has just arrived at Mar-a-Lago pic.twitter.com/VA1A1QswnI\n\u2014 AlexandruC4 (@AlexandruC4) January 5, 2025\nAnd there\u2019s now a belief that she\u2019s entered the emperor\u2019s inner circle:\nBREAKING. According to reports, Italy\u2019s PM Giorgia Meloni is secretly flying to Mar-a-Lago to meet Donald Trump. Foreign minister Tajani was reportedly kept in the dark about her trip. But Elon Musk\u2019s man in Italy posted this before everyone else. So, unlike Tajani, he knew\u2026 pic.twitter.com/Uum2mqmp2B\n\u2014 Antonello Guerrera (@antoguerrera) January 4, 2025\nWhat does Meloni\u2019s welcoming into the emperor\u2019s inner circle signify for Europe? Let\u2019s take a brief look at her record.\nMeloni encapsulates the European nationalist upstarts in recent years who have quickly abandoned their rebel bona fides in order to be welcomed into the halls of power. The Sweden Democrats and Geert Wilders\u2019 Party for Freedom in The Netherlands are not dissimilar. In the latter case, the Dutch government of which Wilders party is the largest member continues to do Washington\u2019s bidding against China even though it means running Europe\u2019s most valuable tech company into the ground. Even France\u2019s Marine Le Pen was heading down the Meloni path taking a more pro-NATO line before being sidelined by Macron maneuvers.\nMeloni followed in the footsteps of her predecessor, unelected former Goldman Sachs executive and European Central Bank president Mario Draghi, in her support for Project Ukraine. Draghi was an early architect of the economic war against Moscow and grand plans to turn Italy into an energy hub. Both have failed despite Meloni\u2019s best efforts to carry them forward. The ensuing inflation and destruction of industry have had predictable results and continue a long, ugly trend for Italy:\nItaly\u2019s real wage misery: inflation-adjusted wages in 2023 were 4.4% lower than in 1990. Even real wages in Greek performed a little better. pic.twitter.com/rRN9QE4JE7\n\u2014 Philipp Heimberger (@heimbergecon) July 3, 2024\n`\nOf course, most European workers have started to experience the same over the past three years. The Meloni government carries on with its tepid support for Project Ukraine despite the opposition from the Italian public:\nNevertheless, following her visit to Mar-a-Lago, Meloni had the following to say about the war:\n\u201cI have always maintained that the only way to force Russia to sit at the negotiating table was to construct a difficult situation\u201d on the ground, she said. Trump\u2019s first presidency showed he has the ability to \u201cmix diplomacy and deterrence,\u201d she added, predicting it will be the same this time around. Abandoning Ukraine at this point, she said, \u201cwould be an error.\u201d\nThat doesn\u2019t inspire confidence about finding an agreement with Moscow, although it\u2019s unclear how much Meloni\u2019s views represent Trump\u2019s thinking.\nIf that\u2019s the line she\u2019s pushing, however, she\u2019s not all that different from the Macrons, Starmers, Scholzs, and Trudeas, albeit with different branding. And Meloni is like them in more ways than just on Ukraine.\nWhile her and her government are decidedly \u201canti-woke\u201d and champion \u201cfamily values\u201d, they also spend a considerable amount of time working to depict WWII-era Italian fascists as victims of commie anti-Italian racism, blame immigrants for Italy\u2019s woes while still bringing in enough to supply cheap labor, and continue the strip mining of Italy. Last year the Meloni government sold off the fixed-line network of Telecom Italia to New York-based private equity firm KKR, which includes former CIA director David Petraeus as a partner. Elsewhere \u201cItaly Is For Sale,\u201d\u00a0 with tens of billions worth of privatizations planned for the state rail company Ferrovie dello Stato, Poste Italiane, Monte dei Paschi bank and energy giant Eni. The firesale is necessitated by more tax cuts for the wealthy, as well as more than billions of euros Rome has burned through in order to address the loss of pipeline gas from Russia, which includes buying more US LNG.\nA lot to like there from the perspective of a US oligarch. So it\u2019s easy to see why Trump, Meloni and Musk get on so well \u2014 even if there are indeed some differences on Ukraine but no doubt Trump will be calling the shots there.\nAs a reward for being a dutiful subject, Italy is getting a major SpaceX deal.\u00a0 In return the \u201cnationalist\u201d Meloni only has to surrender more of Italy\u2019s sovereignty.. Musk\u2019s company will be providing security services, including encryption services, to the Italian public sector.\nSo it would appear that despite all the talk about anti-globalists coming to power in a Europe that Team Trump supposedly wants to extricate itself from, a few things remain the same: the king\u2019s court in Washington expects dutiful subjects in Europe, and in return they might receive rewards.\nMusk and the AfD\nMusk is also bestowing gifts upon the Alternative for Germany (AfD), encouraging Germans to vote for the party. On its face it might seem a strange turn for an AfD that purportedly favors reclaiming German sovereignty from the EU and NATO to accept assistance from the world\u2019s richest man who happens to also be well-connected with US spooks. Then again, the AfD received its seed money from a reclusive billionaire descendant of prominent Nazis so maybe it\u2019s what one would expect.\nWhile the current political class in Berlin has run the country into the ground and its efforts to silence the AfD, shame its voters, and keep it from power by any means necessary are undemocratic, I view Musk\u2019s sudden involvement not as a victory for Germany, but as an effort to bring the AfD into the US/NATO fold.\nThat shouldn\u2019t be that difficult. Aside from the AfD\u2019s stated hesitancy about serving American interests \u2014 the embrace of Musk might signal a willingness to be flexible there \u2014 there really isn\u2019t much difference between the AfD and the European \u201ccenter\u201d anymore. Last week\u2019s audio livestream alongside party co-leader Alice Weidel on X included an alarming \u2014 and telling \u2014 ignorance about the history of fascism and communism:\nElon Musk and Alice Weidel (of the far-right German AfD party) put their brains together for a discussion:\nWeidel: \u201cThe National Socialists (Nazis) were socialist. Adolf Hitler was a socialist.\u201d\nMusk: \u201cYeah, they nationalized industries like crazy.\u201d\nWeidel: \u201cHe was a\u2026 pic.twitter.com/TmDzHqTidM\n\u2014 Drop Site (@DropSiteNews) January 9, 2025\nUnder Musk and Weidel\u2019s telling, the Meloni government\u2019s selling off state-owned industry to American private equity is a noble undertaking as it\u2019s apparently the opposite of what Hitler would do. No doubt, Germany should follow Meloni\u2019s lead.\nMusk and Weidel are propagating a historical view that fits right in with Atlanticists who have been so busy for so long trying to equate WWII-era Nazism and communism. While originally more of a fringe view, it started to go more mainstream in 2008 when the European Parliament adopted a resolution establishing August 23 as the \u201cEuropean Day of Remembrance for the victims of Stalinism and Nazism\u201d \u2014 effectively equating the two Also called Black Ribbon Day, the US in 2019 adopted a resolution to observe the date.\nThe same year, the European Parliament went even further and adopted a resolution \u201con the importance of European Remembrance for the Future of Europe.\u201d It proclaims that the Molotov-Ribbentrop pact was responsible for World War II, and consequently that Soviet Russia is as guilty of the war as Nazi Germany.\nNo matter that the pact, from the Soviet perspective, was agreed to in order to buy itself time seeing as Poland, France and other European states refused to ally with the USSR. If anyone should share more of the blame it would be the West, which preferred Nazism to communism and hoped Hitler would turn the Nazi war machine against the Soviet Union, which he of course did, resulting in 25 million Russian deaths.\nEven the nowadays-Russophobic Guardian published an opinion piece by Seumas Milne back in 2009 that admitted this:\n\u2026the pretence that Soviet repression reached anything like the scale or depths of Nazi savagery \u2013 or that the postwar \u201censlavement\u201d of eastern Europe can be equated with wartime Nazi genocide \u2013 is a mendacity that tips towards Holocaust denial. It is certainly not a mistake that could have been made by the Auschwitz survivors liberated by the Red Army in 1945.\nThe real meaning of the attempt to equate Nazi genocide with Soviet repression is clearest in the Baltic republics, where collaboration with SS death squads and direct participation in the mass murder of Jews was at its most extreme, and politicians are at pains to turn perpetrators into victims. Veterans of the Latvian Legion of the Waffen-SS now parade through Riga, Vilnius\u2019s Museum of Genocide Victims barely mentions the 200,000 Lithuanian Jews murdered in the Holocaust and Estonian parliamentarians honour those who served the Third Reich as \u201cfighters for independence\u201d.\nMost repulsively of all, while rehabilitating convicted Nazi war criminals, the state prosecutor in Lithuania \u2013 a member of the EU and Nato \u2013 last year opened a war crimes investigation into four Lithuanian Jewish resistance veterans who fought with Soviet partisans: a case only abandoned for lack of evidence. As Efraim Zuroff, veteran Nazi hunter and director of the Simon Wiesenthal Centre, puts it: \u201cPeople need to wake up to what is going on. This attempt to create a false symmetry between communism and the Nazi genocide is aimed at covering up these countries\u2019 participation in mass murder.\u201d\nSo with Weidel and Musk\u2019s history lesson we see yet again that there isn\u2019t much light between the \u201ccenter\u201d and the \u201cfar right\u201d except the latter is at least willing to consider good relations with present-day Russia so as to not harm their own economic interests. Trump might be willing to allow that. Elsewhere, they are both in agreement on the broad outlines of militarism and neoliberalism.\nLet\u2019s not forget there is another upstart party in Germany who, like the AfD, is also labeled a populist Putin stooge. Its leader has had pie slammed in her face, fake blood thrown on her and is widely derided in the media for opposing the deployment of US medium range missiles in Germany and Berlin\u2019s subservience to Washington. And yet the world\u2019s richest man is not offering Sahra Wagenknecht a helping hand.\nIs that because her party, the Sahra Wagenknecht Alliance (BSW) doesn\u2019t have a small core of supporters who are neo Nazis or because her economic policies would favor the working class over the likes of Musk \u2014 or both?\nDespite all the media efforts to lump Wagenknecht and the AfD together as Kremlin-controlled, anti-democratic far-right threats, the parties are largely polar opposites. Just a few examples:\nA German government supported by and run for the interests of a strong working class coalition wouldn\u2019t have to worry about the likes of Musk. Of course Germany wouldn\u2019t be in the position it is in at all because it wouldn\u2019t have been bought off by Americans, but it is now in position of living by the US oligarchs and largely dying by the US oligarchs. As of now, the next German government looks likely to be headed by the Christian Democratic Union (CDU), which is again not that far apart from the AfD \u2014 likely to finish second in the February election although probably not strong enough to force its way into a coalition government \u2014 aside from the formers belligerence towards Russia and devotion to NATO.\nThe Musk embrace of the AfD is potentially part of a \u201csuggestion\u201d from the US that the CDU consider forming a coalition with the AfD. If that\u2019s the case, Weidel and company might owe a few favors.\nYou\u2019d think European anti-globalists and nationalists would be turning and running from the US and the likes of Musk or at least working like mad to find ways to counter American influence. And yet through one of the most magical witches\u2019 brews ever concocted \u2014 some combination of bribes, threats, short-sighted self interest, and propaganda \u2014 the European political class clings to what is hollowing out their countries.\nPerhaps this time it results in a welcome end to Project Ukraine, but the line of thinking that Trump will come in and some new alignment of Orban, Fico, the real Meloni, and company will bring better days seems like wishful thinking at best.\nIt\u2019s more likely that putative nationalists like Meloni and company are able to rebrand Europe\u2019s vassalage and neoliberalism as some sort of victory against the grating virtue signalling of the Davos cabal while continuing to assist the US in the plundering of Europe.\nThe Swedish Democrats were against NATO all the time until the parliament vote when they all voted for NATO entry as well as the surrender treaty D.C.A. They also cut social safety nets for the poor, even though they said that they wouldn\u2019t.\nAll these right-wing parties, incl. AfD etc. won\u2019t bring any change. Economically, they are right-wing parties, meaning always supportive to capital and hostile to workers. They will also fold when the USA bring out their dark forces. These right-wing parties also contain a bunch of fringe people with fringe interests. The leader of Sweden Democrats invited a criminal gang biker to his wedding, of whom the party leader \u201cknew nothing\u201d even though the biker being together with one of the party leader\u2019s \u201coldest party friends\u201d. There will be plenty of such material in all these AfDs to ply them into any kama vassalage sutra position, US would like to.\nhttps://www-aftonbladet-se.translate.goog/nyheter/a/g6eglJ/akesson-sager-ja-till-nato-om-finland-gar-med?_x_tr_sl=auto&_x_tr_tl=en&_x_tr_hl=en&_x_tr_pto=wapp\nhttps://www-sverigesradio-se.translate.goog/artikel/riksdagen-har-sagt-ja-till-svenskt-medlemskap-i-nato?_x_tr_sl=auto&_x_tr_tl=en&_x_tr_hl=en&_x_tr_pto=wapp\nhttps://www-riksdagen-se.translate.goog/sv/aktuellt/aktuelltnotiser/2024/juni/18/ja-till-avtal-om-forsvarssamarbete-med-usa_cms2fa8b58c-5dc6-455f-b909-95d1d9477599sv/?_x_tr_sl=auto&_x_tr_tl=en&_x_tr_hl=en&_x_tr_pto=wapp&_x_tr_hist=true\nFor the sake of clarification and to avoid confusion, the right wing extremist party in Sweden is called the Sweden Democrats. The traditional left of centre until Palme was assassinated party that was in power for over 50 years until the late 1970s, and is now all in for Nato and neoliberalism, is the Social Democrats. There is no \u2018Swedish Democrats\u2019 party as such. And barely any socialist or traditional trades union supporting party in deed if not name.\nThanks for the correction, JohnA. Updated.\nThe word \u201cvoters\u201d say it all. Muppets are only allowed to vote because the game\u2019s already rigged.\nIt is very clear what the US has been trying to achieve. As shown by Musk\u2019s support for AfD, the victory of the far right party in Germany will almost certainly lead to a surge in emigration as young professionals increasingly look for exits from economic downturns in Germany. The AfD victory will be the final nail in the coffin for many young professionals.\nThere is only one place most of them will go to: the US. As the domino starts falling with far right fascist parties gaining power across Europe, more and more European workers especially those with professional degrees will start to flee. Trump and Musk will then hand out H-1Bs to poach the European skilled labor force with ease, maybe even enticing them with permanent residency.\nThis is the strategic end game of the US since the Ukraine war. The European prosperity is over.\nFascist parties already have power across Europe, but are called democratic/green/whatever. They even fight a war against Russians, just like in the fascist heyday, with similar results.\nComplete nonsense, the idea Europeans are going to abandon their social safety nets to go work for H1Bs in the US for what? So that they\u2019ll realize 2/3s of their inflated salaries will go to pay for overpriced healthcare and thousands per month on a 1 bedroom apartment?\nIt amazes me how around the internet people still believe in this Europeans are dreaming to move to Texas for some shitty IT job on some Musk like vulture capital nonsense.\nYoung professionals are even more likely to value the last vestiges of EU liberalism and its last breaths, things like healthcare and education are more than enough to make liberal young Europeans stay at home, certainly at least not moving to god damn Texas. Its the complete opposite of your theory. The more likely people to migrate to the US are old middle-upper-class established professionals who have no problem hailing hitler a second time.\nEurope is already in austerity budget, with its energy supply controlled by the US. The populist oppositions, if they ever find themselves in government, will have to learn the hard way that economic reform is next to impossible without monetary and energy sovereignty.\nLet\u2019s see how long before young people with professional degrees start getting laid off and have to look elsewhere for economic opportunities.\nBy the way, none of this is new. This was what the US and Europe had done to the developing world for many decades, and to the post-Soviet countries after the collapse of the USSR in the 1990s. Many highly educated talents from the USSR ended up in the West.\nIt\u2019s Europe\u2019s turn now to suffer from the same fate. It is only a matter of time.\nSome observations and what I\u2019ll call clarifications. Conor Gallagher may contradict me.\nMeloni was in a weak position when she went to visit Trump in Florida. The Italian authorities had arrested Mohammed Abedini, and the Iranians had arrested Cecilia Sala, ironically, a journalist for Il Foglio, which is a Meloni-nationalist-neoliberal mouthpiece. The arrest of Abedini, natch, was done at the bidding of the U.S. authorities, who still have a whiff of the Abu Omar case about them (overreach and mistakes, but that\u2019s another story).\nSo Meloni was faced with the choice: Go to synapse-deficient Biden and diplomacy-challenged Blinken, or just go to the current head of state, Trump, who seems to be assuming his duties a tad early.\nMeloni went to Trump. The Iranians sprang Sala. Today, I read in Fatto Quotidiano that the Italians dropped the charges against Abedini, who is off now to Teheran.\nIn spite of a bump up in the polls for Fratelli d\u2019Italia and Meloni, I doubt that this translates into much advantage.\nFurther, I\u2019ll add that the SpaceX / StarLink deal isn\u2019t a sure thing. It turns out, as recently reported, that President Mattarella expressed doubts a few times over the past couple of years\u2026 National security, something rightists blabber about till someone dangles a few coins in front of their noses. Also, I wouldn\u2019t rule out Tajani as foreign minister throwing a brick or two in the path of Elon the Munificent. Tajani has already said that no Italian troops are going to Ukraine.\nAs I have mentioned, there is also a considerable affection for Russians and Russian culture in Italy. Amusingly, and tellingly, the concert season here in the Chocolate City includes much Shostakovich as well as Tchaikovsky and Stravinsky (hard to get around that darn Tchaikovsky and the Nutcracker Suite). Russian artists are performing. Some no longer are based in Russia, but others must have made it through the visa thicket.\nGiven that one of the purposes of the Ukrainian embassy and consulate here is to censor, the local \u201cdiplomats\u201d must be up late, worried about an impending outbreak of Mussorgsky or Borodin.\nThe Italian argument is that the charges against him are not a crime in Italy, something that they hadn\u2019t noticed before.\nYes, it was for tech transfer sanctions violations. The Italians could have chosen to enforce or ignore it, since they do have similar laws in place, just different scope of coverage.\nI suspect that rising opposition to existing leadership is little more than an impotent electorate\u2019s attempt to throw the bums out. New bums will take over. Security states will reign supreme, spawning wars and domestic repression. Vassalage to Washington will continue unabated, though now publicly acknowledged. And the new bums will neither find nor seek a solution to their dependence on the US\u2019 energy supply/protection racket or to their dependence on other key economic inputs, such as advanced technology.\nIf the USA is circling the wagons, strengthening its Imperial core and binding its wealthiest vassals to it tighter, in order to loot them, it makes sense that it would favour authoritarian fascist governments in said vassals. Of course, we have seen this film before.\nThe future for Europe is Latin America. Welcome to the banana republics.\nOf course, not all of Latin America was a coup-ridden hell hole. The question is, who gets to be Costa Rica and Uruguay (peaceful, neutral, democratic and rich) and who gets the different flavours of authoritarianism: Central American (violent, poor), Argentinian (from riches to rags) and Chilean (neoliberal economic laboratory)? My guess is that Ireland and Switzerland get to be Costa Rica and Uruguay and everybody else gets to be Argentina or Chile.\n\u2018Musk and Weidel are propagating a historical view that fits right in with Atlanticists who have been so busy for so long trying to equate WWII-era Nazism and communism. While originally more of a fringe view, it started to go more mainstream in 2008 when the European Parliament adopted a resolution establishing August 23 as the \u201cEuropean Day of Remembrance for the victims of Stalinism and Nazism\u201d \u2014 effectively equating the two Also called Black Ribbon Day, the US in 2019 adopted a resolution to observe the date. The same year, the European Parliament went even further and adopted a resolution \u201con the importance of European Remembrance for the Future of Europe.\u201d It proclaims that the Molotov-Ribbentrop pact was responsible for World War II, and consequently that Soviet Russia is as guilty of the war as Nazi Germany.\u2019\nThis has got to be one of the most vile developments of the past decade or so. How actual Nazis are being rehabilitated in Europe and even Canada. We pretend that there are no Nazis in the Ukraine and ignore all the Nazi symbols. Votes against Nazis in the UN are now being voted against by more and more (mostly western) countries. How Russians, who liberated Auschwitz, are not allowed to attend ceremonies there while Germans, who ran those camps, are actually invited. And trying to pretend that the Molotov-Ribbentrop pact caused WW2 while ignoring how France and the UK totally abandoned Czechoslovakia to the Nazis who had about 50 divisions behind mountains ready to fight. You now have memorials to the victims of communism being erected in western countries but none to the victims of capitalism. I\u2019ll say it now. When you re-write history so that it has no resemblance to historical truth, it never ends well.\nIt is not of past decade or so. Rehabilitation of Nazis started in 1945, and shifted in high gear in 1991 (especially in Soviet and Yugoslav areas). Westerners did not pay much attention, and are only now seeing the results of their hard work.\nOne dumb question:\nWhat / who is Musk besides just Musk? Who are we talking about when we say \u201cMusk\u201d? Where is the substance there that amounts to true power?\nI have an imagination of a group or even class of people if I think of CIA, Homeland Security or NSA. Hundreds of Thousands of people. Countless offices, Congressmen, Senators, governors, etc. \u2013 structures, deep ties, alumni, law firms, families, allegiance etc. \u2013 nationhood, governance, normative power in the Schmittean sense.\nSame with arms manufactureres, or the gentlemen of Halliburton and Co.\nMusk, Thiel, Bezos, Zucker? They appear to me more like actors, diversions, puppets?\nWhen fb did not follow the deep state on censorship \u2013 what happened? Sen. Warner called, they came running like school boys and got a major dress down.\nLets imagine Boeing, Lockheed, Northrop had something different on their mind than Mr. Warner \u2013 who would call whom in this case? And would there actually be a call at all?\nSo, why is there constant talk about Musk? Aint\u2019t that mere chirping in the jungle? Isn\u2019t he a clown? And I mean not to denigrate his significance as a guy who speaks to POTUS. But even Kissinger was only as powerful as he served others\u2019  interests. Beyond elections its eventually about structures never individuals.\nWhich leads me to the next question \u2013 who pulls the strings in the EU?\nWhy is there a clown in the circus? So that the plebs would not pay attention to the men behind the curtain.\nWhy Musk? Because he has talent and ambition. Why Zucker? Because talent is not necessary.\nThanks for this write-up. That\u2019s the first I\u2019d heard of those crazy privatization schemes in Italy. I thought those had mostly fallen out of fashion as they got too embarrassing.

Why should it be different elsewhere?\nViva, yes, but one can do more than just cheer.\nAccording to BSW\u2019s Web site\u2019s FAQ, German law allows foreigners to donate up to \u20ac1,000 to political parties without any formalities (contributions above that figure are regulated and must be cleared in advance with the party). BSW is the ONLY nationally-visible political party in the EU that I know of campaigning on social and economic policies reasonably consistent with NC\u2019s advocacy and that occasionally manages to leak its message into mainstream media (though usually as a whipping-boy, as shown in the FAZ link in Irrational\u2019s link below).\nThose who want to support some slight chance of influencing sane policy in the west could do worse than to consider a contribution. Their Web site is at bsw-vg.de.\nAfter reading this fully, I will borrow a Yves phrase and give my 50,000 foot overview to describe my take on it: Europe\u2019s increasingly popular so called \u201cfar right\u201d is more accurately described as European neoliberals who differ on a few specific policies, AND favor normalizing relations and doing business with Russia. That\u2019s good for Russia and world peace. And significantly, it also points the the probable outcome and solution to Yves quedtion posed in her next article about how will Russia deal with a difficult endgame and \u201cwin the peace.\u201d\nWeidel is so obviously an establishment stooge it is nearly comical, but the Argentinians have proven that a population can be so easily conned into voting for such an obvious stooge against their own interests. Let\u2019s also remember that the German establishment put Hitler in power after the Nazi vote went down in the second German election of 1932. Hitler never had a mandate from the German people, the 1933 election was utterly fixed and carried out under mass intimidation.\nSoon after Hitler got in power he destroyed the SA, the populist wing of the Nazi movement.\nThe West has, and always will, align itself with fascism (and its worst iteration, Nazism) for the simple reason that fascism protects capital. Thats all its about, freedom for billionaires to continue to rape their citizens, profit from war and create digital feudalism in the name of capitalism.\nIt\u2019s multipolar neoliberalism.\nToo much of the same game, with variations on the labels, are being played on the global political scene.  How are oligarchs reigned in?\nAsk Mister Ma of Alibaba fame in China\u2026\nOr the guy that wanted to take Putin\u2019s pen.\nYou know how sausages are made.\nThe simple fact that in that conversation with Mr. Musk , Weidel so vehemently and obviously attacked none other than CDU, the party closest to AfD and politically Weidel\u2019s home betrayed her true colours and intentions. Deny deny deny. Until you believe it even yourself.\nVery well summarised, thank you!\nMaybe one could add that capitalism will align with basically anything as long it\u2019s interests are recognised.\nGood reality check, Conor G.\nThanks for the post, Conor.\nRight in tune with you theory, \u201ceconomists take apart BSW\u2019s economic program\u201d, apologies behind a pay wall:\nhttps://www.faz.net/aktuell/wirtschaft/mehr-wirtschaft/bsw-wahlprogramm-wirtschaftsforscher-monieren-misstrauen-gegenueber-marktprozessen-110223511.html\nAs if they are unconcerned about AfD.. oh, wait\u2026\nIf your vassals can just vote to not be vassals, were they ever really your vassals?\nIt seems clear that, barring much greater demand destruction, Europe\u2019s dependence on natural gas from the US will keep them paying a crippling tribute, and shaking with every political quiver of the world LNG infrastructure.\nFirst the fake liberals, then the fake conservatives.\nYour email address will not be published.

It describes the first phases of a authoritarian takeover of the southern border region using the US Military.\n\u201cThis is not about the U.S.-Mexico border region or fixing our broken immigration system. Instead, it\u2019s about consolidating power and making a profit while distracting us with intimidation and fearmongering. In Trump\u2019s executive orders we can see how his administration could build an authoritarian infrastructure under the guise of protecting Americans from an \u201cinvasion.\u201d\u201d\n\u201cAnother dangerous EO is the \u201cDeclaring a National Emergency at the Southern Border of the United States,\u201d which forces the U.S. military into a gray zone of civil enforcement and policing, to be exploited by Trump for political purposes. In the EO, Trump gives the U.S. Northern Command 30 days to create a Level 3 Plan, which is one step below a full-blown operational document for battle, according to Military.com. All to fight an \u201cinvasion\u201d that doesn\u2019t exist.\u201d\nhttps://www.theborderchronicle.com/p/trumps-invasion-theatrics-act-1\nHmmm \u2013 would that be kinda like how the Biden administration, and the Obama administration, and the Bush administration all eroded our civil rights, instituted surveillance and censorship, and put ever more people in prison over the last 25 years (the US left Russia and China in the dust in incarceration rates some time ago \u2013 we\u2019re #1!!)  ??

It was \u201ckids in cages\u201d the first time around, and then not a care in the world when it turned out kids were still in cages when Biden took over.  Yes, \u201cinvasion\u201d is a stretch, kind of like \u201cinsurrection\u201d was, but to try to hand wave this away as nothing to really worry about is ridiculous.  The majority of the country sees unchecked immigration as a big problem, and for good reason.

There has to be mass graves or funeral records of the million people being buried.

I guess some lives matter much more than other.\nI\u2019am more worried about the confusing/rewritng of history. This was in relation to the  liberation of auschwitz being remembered and many of these camps were in fact liberated by the Soviets. Not the Americans of the picture. The Russian dominant role in the defeat of Nazi\u2019s is often chipped away at.\nHere in Hawaii the liberation of Dachau by the Nisei 442 RCT is a big deal.\nSeems like a good time to uncork the ol\u2019 I Was Not a Nazi Polka:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmhgcC5dYkE\nOMD, thank you, I needed that! \ud83e\udd23\nWasn\u2019t that the Nazi Wehrmacht, who from 1941\u201345  (mostly in 1941) deliberately starved three and a third million Soviet POW to death in open air concentration camps without soap water or medical care (more than the Armenian genocide)? https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/13518046.2024.2340839#abstract\nThe Wikipedia link above states that the Canadian novelist Bacque, author of the book, Other Losses, on which these ghastly allegations about Eisenhower are based, was criticized for having no historical or research experience and that critics found his book \u201cspectacularly flawed\u201d .\n\u201cAfter the publication of Bacque\u2019s book, a panel of eight historians gathered for a symposium in the Eisenhower Center for American Studies[38] at the University of New Orleans from December 7\u20138, 1990 to review Bacque\u2019s work.[39] In the introduction to a book later published containing each panelists\u2019 papers, Steven E. Ambrose noted that Bacque is a Canadian novelist with no previous historical research or writing experience. His introduction concludes that \u201cOther Losses is seriously\u2014nay, spectacularly\u2014flawed in its most fundamental aspects.\u201d[39][40] The panel comments that, among its many problems, Other Losses:[39]\nmisuses documents\nmisreads documents\nignores contrary evidence\nemploys a statistical methodology that is hopelessly compromised\nmade no attempt to see the evidence he has gathered in relation to the broader situation\nmade no attempt to perform any comparative context\nputs words into the mouths of the subjects of his oral history\nignores a readily available and absolutely critical source that decisively dealt with his central accusation.\nOn the other hand the Nazi Wehrmacht actually did do these things to Soviet POWs, including prohibiting civilians from throwing food parcels into the enclosure, resulting in the deaths of 330 million prisoners, which was judged to be the main cause of their deaths.\nI\u2019m in the midst of Swedish Death Cleaning-which is quite liberating, and maybe 15 years ago bought complete runs of 1943 & 1944 National Geographic magazines at a yard sale for a few bucks, each years worth wrapped in newspaper and secured with twine. I never unwrapped \u2019em.\nTook \u2019em to Utah for some reading material on our ski trip, and the Dartful Codgers really enjoyed them, and everything in the magazines seemingly was geared towards the war effort, all of the advertisements in the front section were from titans of industry and stressed how they were doing this and that in building war machinery and always include soldiers and/or planes/ships in the artwork.\nThe articles directly related to the war probably was around 20%, while images of topless native women commanded a much smaller, but notable presence. Lots of interesting WW2 photos i\u2019ve never glimpsed in the 24 issues.\nOften on the back cover was a Coca Cola ad, always with GI\u2019s holding a bottle aloft.\nConversely now, you wouldn\u2019t really know we\u2019ve been in a hot war in the Ukraine for going on 3 years, it hardly registers.\nIf you ever have the opportunity, it would be worth your while to look through \u201cLife\u201d magazine in the years leading up to the outbreak of war in the Pacific in December of 1941. Did so at the NSW State Library when I was living in Sydney. It really was a different time and a different country.\nIndeed, i\u2019ve too looked at Life magazines leading up to Pearl Harbor and then after, and what a difference.\nIn many of the ads in the NG\u2019s, the wordage says something to the effect of \u2018when the war is over, the new Buick/Boeing offerings for the public will be coming\u2019.\nThis against a backdrop of rationing, including only 5 gallons of gas per week per licensed driver.\nDelayed gratification, what a concept!\nMany of those soldiers were pessimistic how long it would take to fight the war in the Pacific and what waited them at home. There was a saying that went-\n\u2018The Golden Gate in forty-eight,\nthe bread line in forty-nine.\u2019\nWe have had a real time, streamed genocide and war crimes committed by our government.\nIt has been basically ignored in the media and denied again and again that it was genocide or a war crime by our government.\nAnd while what musk has done is reprehensible, it seems to be getting way more press and attention than Gaza. Hundreds of thousands killed Many more wounded, many many more homeless vs him.\nAnd let\u2019s not forget Ukraine and the fact that Biden/harris never even talked to Russia. They had no intention of stopping the killings.\nAgain all supported or ignored by the Dems.\nSo yeah can you ignore or try to change the past?  Yes we have seen it streamed in real time.\nThat is what scares me.\nThe scary part is the most likely \u2018rational\u2019 explanation for normalizing the current horrors is that our betters assume they\u2019ll need to do much worse in the future.\nI suppose there is a line of thinking that all of this madness ,for the entirety of this century so far; is just securing a chair somewhere before the music stops\u2026.. but really these psychos who run the world are just making real;  the prophecy of doom.

Of course you don\u2019t want to leave out \u201cmalinformation.\u201d Elites must be \u201curged\u201d to develop solutions that will further various agendas in the face of majority of people who don\u2019t want to play their game.\nRather than stopping mis/mal/dis-information, the elites should develop penalties for foisting same on the population.\nOf course that would punish various USA public and private agencies and media that have misled the public for their own purposes.\nFor example, the \u201cintelligence professionals\u201d who signed onto the Hunter Biden laptop \u201cappears to be Russian dis-information\u201d story could be liable for damages to the USA public by their actions which could suggest they are also guilty of election interference.\nWould be a good \u201cmake a job for a lawyer program\u201d.\n\u201cTaliban ambassador warns Rubio against bounty threat over Americans in Afghanistan\u201d\n\u2018A Taliban ambassador is warning new U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio against making threats after he said he would place bounties on Afghanistan\u2019s rulers for their continued detention of U.S. nationals.\u2019\nSo who is supposed to be collecting these bounties? ISIS fighters fresh from Syria? Not hard to guess where Rubio got this idea from. During the occupation of Afghanistan there was this bs claim that the Russians were putting bounties on American troops on the battlefield and there was a lot of outrage in DC and in the main stream media. No proof of course so you were left taking the word of US officials. Then a few months later the claim was changed so now it was Iran putting bounties on America troops. A few months later it was some other nation accused of putting bounties on American troops but I forget who. Afghanistan could invite US officials to that country to discuss the issue but that would never happen.\n\u201cPolice officers who were at the Capitol that day and political violence experts have warned that the pardons could lead to further acts of violence.\u201d\nThey didn\u2019t specify who would be carrying out those \u201cacts of violence.\u201d\nStay safe. Avoid at all costs \u201cImperial entanglements.\u201d\nWestern Holocaust denialism is far stronger against the Russians.  They no longer even acknowledge that the Soviets liberated big Eastern European camps or that Slavs make up the majority of the counted victims of the Holocaust.\nEuropean and American officials will not even admit a Russian presence at Auschwitz memorial while permitting German and Israeli presence.  While denial of Jewish Holocaust is a fringe and disreputable position, anti-Russian hysteria is mandatory in Western officialdom.\nIn any case, Zionists undeniably weaponize the memory of the Holocaust decades after the fact (and hiding their collaboration with the Nazi regime in the 1930s and use of ex-Nazis after 1948) to shout down accusations of Israeli crimes before and after 1948.\nInteresting what gets highlighted in Twitter (a false charge of extensive denial of the Jewish Holocaust by a Zionist who defends what Israel does to its neighborhood) rather than the far more extensive denial of a Slavic Holocaust and the Soviet role in liberating the world from the Nazi scourge.\nIt starts with the erasure of the original term \u201cjudeobolshevism\u201d, basically Nazis thought Jews and bolsheviks were the same, if there was any distinction it was that Jews were the ruling class, manipulating the slavs. I\u2019m sure Hitler would be quite surprised if he was to learn that he and USSR were ideological buddies and WW2 transpired only because they were too similar and had to determine who is the undisputed numero uno in the dictator business.\nNazi thought that Slavs are lesser-humans (that should be exterminated and their lands taken), and most of the Western Europe did too. Nothing has changed there. All of the mental gymnastics presented nowdays is pahtetic (including attempts at equalizing Soviet Union and Nazi Germany, present in your post).\nMultigenerational PFAS Breastfeeding\nIt\u2019s the old Excepional Country story.

Still, nice to have cat waiting for you when you get home, even if is only for dinner.\nOur younger boy was chosen in this way. Notably, he was having a \u201cnot great\u201d day, as he had just been \u201cun-chosen\u201d by his lover just hours earlier. His new partner turned out to be higher in maintenance and more loyal.\nMy wife (and I as collateral) was once selected in this way as well. This cat used subterfuge too. He was a beautiful sooty gray. \u201cWe love Siamese cats!\u201d was overheard many times. That, of course, was soot. Soon enough he was revealed to be an orange cat. Rest in peace D Train, I think of you pretty much every day.\nThere was a time when I disagreed with having pets.  Then I was accosted by one cat in particular who quickly secured concession with excessive headbutting, generally comporting herself like her whole mission and purpose on earth was to change my mind, ensure I couldn\u2019t say no.

It discusses how Mangione (Luigi, not Chuck) fits into the tradition of \u201cpropaganda by deed\u201d and Alexander Berkman.\nBut misses Gaetano Bresci, who was a better shot than Berkman (Prato now has a  street named after him).\nTolkien once described himself (in a letter to his son) as an anarchist, which seems to be how the Shire works (even though there is a king in the background).\nI don\u2019t know, Chuck did eventually decide to stick it to the man.\nLooks like that Holocaust quote, like **many** lightly-attributed quotes floating around the internet, is of dubious origin.\ndon\u2019t shoot the messenger.  we don\u2019t need fake quotes to tell us to remember history\nhttps://search.brave.com/search?q=eisenhower+some+film+bastard\nAs Einstein said, \u201cdon\u2019t believe everything you read on the internet\u201d.\nPage 256 of my 2008 edition of Bartlett\u2019s!\nre: Holocaust / Zionism\nGenocide Denial in Holocaust Studies\nBy Raz Segal\nScholar Raz Segal recounts the strange experience of being attacked as an antisemite, despite being Jewish himself and studying the Holocaust and other genocides, for the high crime of opposing Israel\u2019s slaughter in Gaza.\nhttps://jacobin.com/2025/01/gaza-genocide-holocaust-studies-germany\nOn the TV tonight it was saturation coverage on the Holocaust. I saw that Zelensy, whose countries provided many guards for those camps, was present at the Auschwitz service but the Russians, who freed those camps, weren\u2019t. The Russians had their own memorial service but  to the siege of Leningrad in which so many civilians died. The BBC\u2019s Steve Rosenberg filed a story at a two year-old memorial to all the Russian civilians that died during the war, But Rosenberg took umbridge at this memorial in the TV report implying that it should have only been for the one million dead Jews and not the 17-18 million civilians who died-\nhttps://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cwyw0vkzkzdo\nThis year\u2019s Auschwitz party was a closed one. Only for the organizers.\nLast night\u2019s NBC News story on the Auschwitz commemoration made sure to warn about the startling rise in \u201cantisemitism\u201d over the last few years, just in case there were any viewers who didn\u2019t get it. Also, and to Emma\u2019s point above, the story stated, quote, that \u201calmost all the victims were Jewish.\u201d  I think this is true for Auschwitz itself, in terms of percentages. But for the typical uninformed American, \u201cAuschwitz\u201d usually represents the Holocaust as a whole. So the effect of the story was to emphasize Jewish victimization while ignoring that of other groups \u2013 while also noting our current epidemic of \u201cantisemitism,\u201d of course. Never again\u2026\nYes it is a clusterfuck. (I know no more appropriate word)\nLarry Johnson e.g.\nThe West Continues to Insult Russia\nhttps://sonar21.com/the-west-continues-to-insult-russia/\nor this hint that German state media do not mention USSR at all.\nWhich is beyond words\u2026\nGerman:\nhttps://www.telepolis.de/features/Auschwitz-Befreiung-Wenn-die-Befreier-aus-der-Geschichte-verschwinden-10258420.html\np.s. I haven\u00b4t checked exact numbers but FInkelstein never forgets to remind of the 2mn. USSR POWs kille/died in Germany\nIf you were to count other groups (aka the elephant in the room), then the Jewish victimization would be second best, which would go against the-biggest-victim narrative.\nOn a percentage of population, save perhaps the Roma, who no one seems to mind exterminating, the Jews would still have it worse.\nOn a percentage of population, Serbs had it tragically bad in both World Wars (which I consider to be essentially the same war, that we see continuation of nowdays). My comment is not about statistical competition in who had it worse (because the numbers can be massaged beyond recognition, like in \u201cGDP games\u201d), but about completly neglecting countless victims in order to push the narrative. Maybe I should have writtet the-only-victim-worth-mentioning narrative instead the-biggest-victim narrative (because it was never a competition).\nEven if we accept that the victim group XYZ had it worst, I expect them to show respect for those that were dying alongside them, and not make everything about themselves. That skewed me-me-me narrative is largely responsible for the whole Holocaust denial thing. People with no knowlege of history see that something does not add up, and dismiss everything (aka. throw the baby out with the bathwater).\nThose who do not learn history are doomed to repeat it, and we see many things repeating because the narrative required the history to be taught wrongfully. That\u2019s how one get everyone to chant Slava Ukraina. /rant\n\u201cme me me\u201d? Yes. Amplificaton via post 1945 media made it worse. A huge issue. And it naturally fed aversion. On what that nurtured in particular cases (as per pre-1945 hate or not) is a different matter. But that instead of being acknlowledged as a normal human reaction (fighting and wanting to hurt are human too, we are no angels) it was pathologized as Nazism as such.\nbig problem. not solved. still.\np.s. in fact what is not all understood and no-no in Germany \u2013 pre-Nazism Europe Jews wanted not to be seen as \u201cJews\u201d. Wanteit not be about them no \u201cme me me\u201d. But like everyone else. And this had worked to a considerable extent I believe. Which is one reason why Zionism was a minority thing. Another no-no in Germania today. Of course it did feed class-warfare phenomena with the influx of poor Jewish-Jewish who had fallen back on that identity thing in lack of anything other. Bourgeoisie didnt want them.\np.p.s. what we are witnessing is how for decades Europe had confined the topic \u201cgenocide\u201d and destruction of the Global South/colonialism and made it possible to handle all its crimes against humanity by uniquely elevating Holocaust eclipsing everything else that happened before, at the same time and since.\nAnd now after 80 years this mis-representation disintegrates and all the corpses are dragged into the sunlight. Trying to salvage some honour by neglecting 90% of the other victims ain\u00b4t workin\u00b4no more. Which is why South Africa at ICJ was so historic (despite my personal disappointment they fell short of calling it a genocide without hair-raising caveats such as \u201cplausible\u201d.) the mad notion of worthy and unworthy victims.\nDon\u2019t forget that the Nazis had an array of camps for different purposes from 1934 onwards, and they bureaucratically sent different groups to different camps. Thus, there were separate camps for male and female resistance fighters, for example. In general, the model was that those who were capable of working were worked to death, and those who couldn\u2019t work were summarily killed. In Auschwitz the vast majority of the inmates (perhaps 90%) were Jews, but even there things were confused: Primo Levi was sent to Auschwitz for his resistance activities, although he was also Jewish. And these work-camps have to be distinguished from the horrors of the four camps constructed in Poland to murder two million Jews in 1942-43, to preserve food for more deserving human beings, and which were destroyed afterwards.\nAuschwitz was there to provide labour for the huge methanol and rubber factory next door hence the fact that some survived. Also the Nazis focussed their Jew-killing activities in 1942-3; the last big massacre was of Hungarian Jews in 1944, which is also why a lot of the Salonika Jews rounded up after Italy\u2019s surrender survived. (Levi talks about them in his memoir.)\nI was at the gym on treadmill and on one of the 35 monitors, I saw Wolf Blitzer and Dana Bash walking inside some Auschwitz building. Wolf had his trench coat collar up looking serious and Dana pointing to the wall\u2026I have no idea what they were saying, but I found the optics bizarre since Wolff was hosting his show and cut to this previously recorded piece. I think they are both Jewish, so maybe that\u2019s why the news casters were part of the news?\nOne interesting tidbit I found recently: if you look at the well-known, remarkable zionists who played a major role in the foundation and the subsequent construction of Israel, none of them had ever been persecuted by the nazis. In fact, those zionists were safely away in the UK, the USA, or in the British mandate of Palestine when the nazis were perpetrating the holocaust:\nZeev Jabotinski\nChaim Weizmann\nDavid Ben Gurion\nGolda Meir\nAriel Sharon\nMoshe Dayan\nYitzhak Shamir\nShimon Peres\nLooking at the biography of the presidents of Israel, the pattern is even more pronounced, with all of them having immigrated to or been born in Palestine when Hitler came to power:\nYosef Sprinzak\nYitzhak Ben-Zvi\nKadish Luz\nZalman Shazar\nEphraim Katzir\nYitzhak Navon\nChaim Herzog\nEzer Weizman\nReuven Rivlin\nAnd the same characteristic is evident for the prime ministers:\nMoshe Sharett\nLevi Eshkol\nYigal Allon\nYitzhak Rabin\nMenachem Begin escaped Poland in the nick of time. He was persecuted by the NKVD, but he never confronted the nazis.\nMissing names correspond to persons born after WWII.\nI did not look into all ministerial positions, supreme court judges, generals, etc, but it is remarkable that not a single survivor of the WWII persecutions ever ascended to those commanding heights. Israel was thus always the realm of hard-core zionists, not the recovered haven for persecuted Jews around the world, and especially not for the survivors of the shoah. In fact, it looks very much as if the zionists were always disconnected from what was happening to their supposed Jewish brethren in Europe.\nInterestingly, Uri Avnery, who both fought to establish Israel and was later a notable peace activist, staunch proponent of a genuine peace agreement with the Palestinians, had actually lived in Germany under the nazi regime and suffered from its antisemitic measures.\nI checked the list of chiefs of the general staff of the Israeli army, and nothing changes: all of them were either born in, or immigrated to Palestine before the nazis came to power. Haim Bar-Lev and David Elazar were living in Yugoslavia, but departed well before the invasion by the Axis forces.\nAll of this is not enough to be conclusive, but I think it is fairly significant.\nTo Avnery add Akiva Orr, one of the founders of Matzpen, the non-Soviet aligned communist party.\nThanks for the reference.\nBy the way, looking at the list of presidents of the supreme court of Israel, I finally found just one who was actually a holocaust survivor: Aharon Barak (from Lithuania), whose family finally emigrated to Palestine in 1947. Significantly, he was a judge at the ICJ when the genocide case was brought by South Africa; he resigned from his position shortly after the ICJ published its preliminary ruling against Israel.\nAs for the others: all born in or immigrated to Palestine before the nazis. Only Meir Shamgar was living in Danzig till 1939, when his family emigrated to Palestine.\nIt was the Nazis who wanted to drive all Jews out of Germany or Europe as a whole, and it was the Zionists who believed that all Jews should live in Palestine. In other words, their interests were perfectly aligned, even though for many Jews their homeland was Europe and not a desert area to which they had no connection.\nIt may be slightly difficult to understand today, but in the beginning of the Nazi rule in Germany, way before anyone could have imagined the horrors that would be committed by the German people, there were some Zionist Jews who saw Hitler\u2019s political doctrine as an advantage. The Nazis didn\u2019t conceal their desire to get rid of Germany\u2019s Jews, and some Zionists saw it as an opportunity to boost the rate of Jewish immigration from Germany to the Briths Mandate of Palestine, Land of Israel.\nAnd in the newly established state of Israel, Holocaust survivors were despised.\nFor Auschwitz survivor Nahman Kahana, memories of the trains, the bodies, and the hunger were too much to bear once he arrived, \u201ceuphorically,\u201d to Israel in 1948, he says. Plus, it wasn\u2019t a popular topic in the new state, where Jews were trying to carve out a new identity as strong and independent. (Editor\u2019s note: The original version misspelled Mr. Kahana\u2019s name.)\nHolocaust survivors were known here by the derogatory moniker, \u201csabon,\u201d or soap, in reference to the rumors that Nazis made soap from the skin of Jews in the camps. Mr. Kahana preferred to forget the shameful memory of being \u201csheep led to the slaughter.\u201d\nActually, for Hitler himself, their interests were not aligned. He was opposed to a Jewish state as he thought that from there they would have a base to rule the rest of the world (Source: Mein Kampf). There were plenty of other Nazis that thought differently.\nThere\u2019s a reason.  As has been documented, the Zionists were actually collaborating WITH the Nazis to capture and expose Jews who disagreed with the Zionist project, meanwhile paying the Nazis to issue permits to relocate Zionist Jews to Israel.  That was the big controversy at the World Jewish Congresses at the time, that the Zionists were working with the Nazis, against the consensus of the WJC which wanted to expressly protest and boycott the Nazis.\nThe Zionists, being anti-semitic, Herzl considering Jews to be a lower human caste, fundamentally agreed with the Nazi project to cleanse Jewish \u201cvermin\u201d from Europe, so were doing their best to assist the holocaust.\nSee p.23 here, for example:\nhttps://www.palestineremembered.com/images/Zionist-Relations-with-Nazi-Germany-Faris-Yahya-PS.pdf\nRe: \u201cEurope braces for \u2018most extreme\u2019 military scenario as Trump-Putin 2.0 begins\u201d (NBC): yes, losing their minds, but NBC is also hawking those weapons for them:\nAnd yet there are plenty of observers who believe that Europe is not doing nearly enough.\nWestern European countries such as Germany, France and the United Kingdom have only committed \u201csmall percentage uplifts to defense budgets, which is nothing like the transformative investment\u201d in Eastern Europe, said Keir Giles, a leading defense analyst at London\u2019s Chatham House think tank.\nConnects to a muse on Ginsburg\u2019s HOWL earlier today while staring at a quiet Thai bay: Ginsburg wrote HOWL when he was only 28-29.

Energy policy daydreams in the election campaign\nhttps://archive.is/DEAiV\nintro:\n\u201cDuring the election campaign, the CDU/CSU and FDP are calling for the \u201coption\u201d of returning to nuclear power. The AfD is even calling for its expansion. At first glance, this may even sound tempting, since the proponents of a return to nuclear energy are promising the people the moon and the stars \u2013 climate protection with a stable supply and falling energy prices. This creates the impression that the world is in a \u201cnuclear renaissance\u201d and that only ideologically stubborn Germany has once again failed to hear the shot. On closer inspection, however, these daydreams burst like soap bubbles. One can argue excellently about whether the phase-out of nuclear energy was a mistake; but now it has been completed and is irreversible. The construction of new nuclear power plants, on the other hand, is not a sensible option and, above all, is one thing \u2013 very, very expensive.\nBy Jens Berger\u201d\nThey have a number or recently closed down power plants  that have reputation as the best built in the world.\nThey could be reopened, but Germany and the greens decided that burning coal was better than low carbon energy\nWeird.\nRead the entire thing if you have time. it\u00b4s a machine translation though.\nIt\u00b4s not that simple.\nEventually Berger argues in favour of natural gas. Neither NPPs nor renewables.\np.s. Merkel shut down the nuclear plants.\nHowever what would be worth a serious investigation in my view \u2013 while the Merkel admin. prepared shutting down NPPs they knew the US was strictly against NS2.\nBy spring 2021 Biden and Merkel had agreed that NS2 would be stopped in case RU attacked. This was official. Now if you are the chancellor you will have to take precautions in case the RUs do attack and do not jeopardize your energy imports. So why take the risk shutting down the NPPs before having created enough altern. sources. So as to have a safe and long enough transitional phase?\nUtter utter incompetence/corruption.\nre: Ukraine mineral wealth\nA new slightly odd text by Ian Proud (he is often covering in a way I don\u00b4t know what he thinks just like if he still were a diplomat.)\nRussia races for Ukranian mineral wealth before a potential ceasefire\nMoscow is targeting Ukraine\u2019s rich mineral reserves, crippling the steel production efforts and jeopardizing its ability to repay war debts\nhttps://responsiblestatecraft.org/ukraine-war-2670984030/\n\u201cTrump can\u2019t \u2018clean out\u2019 Gaza without destabilizing entire region\u201d\nJust another Trump crazy idea.

Trump and his goons don\u2019t have enough understanding of spending or the work ethic. The stop in federal spending will just be hideous.\nYes. Such \u201cpopulism\u201d would be breathtaking. Just incidentaly, Musk floated a $3 trillion figure a bit before the election.\nHuh? The entire Federal government spending in FY 2022 was $6.75 trillion or 23% of GDP.\n\u201cFederal assistance\u201d is a subset and excludes a lot, starting with payments to individuals and military contractors.\nPlus Trump does not have the authority to permanently impound the money. Questions is what bits get turned back on sort of quickly (a few days to two weeks) v. longer.\nInterior Department staff Monday had no information on when a hiring freeze impacting seasonal and full-time positions at the National Park Service will be lifted.\nThe freeze, implemented across the federal government while the Trump administration looks for ways to cut the federal workforce, left an untold number of individuals hoping to land summer jobs with the Park Service in limbo.\nThe hiring freeze, which reportedly could affect as many as 1,400 individuals, touches both seasonal hires and permanent positions. Each year the Park Service hires an estimated 7,500 workers for the busy summer season. There also are a good number of permanent positions, reaching into the ranks of superintendents, that won\u2019t be filled unless the freeze is lifted, either across the board or for specific positions.\nUnder President Trump\u2019s executive order implementing the freeze, staff at the Office of Management and Budget and the newly created Department of Government Efficiency have 90 days to \u201csubmit a plan to reduce the size of the federal government\u2019s workforce through efficiency improvements and attrition,\u201d an Interior spokesperson told the Traveler. \u201cOnce a plan to reduce the federal workforce through efficiency improvements and attrition is developed, departmental leadership will work closely with its bureaus to execute personnel decisions in a manner that best supports the mission of the department and the policy priorities of the administration.\u201d\nhttps://www.nationalparkstraveler.org/2025/01/interior-department-has-no-news-national-park-service-hiring-hold\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nHere at Sequoia NP, 40% of permanent NPS positions in the park are unfilled-largely because there is no longer term rentals available, all are short term rentals catering to those tourists who want to go into the NP instead.\nSeasonals are what makes the place run in the spring to fall period, take them away and you probably can\u2019t even open the gates, as there is nobody to clean the bathrooms, pick up the trash et al, not to mention all the seasonal rangers, yikes!\nIf I didn\u2019t know better, I\u2019d think that Trump sees a cloistered audience that is in some cases just not being charged enough, case in point, well a 1/12 case that is. My buddy from Tucson gets a tremendous urge for a barley soda, goes into the Lodgepole market in Sequoia NP and buys a tallboy 24 ounce Coors in a can for $2.49, when at a concert or sporting event that same amount is more around $24.\nIs privatization a coming?\nI hope that was Banquet and not Light.\nThe syk household takes a 20% pay cut today, per the freezing of research grants. Still no word from the Dean. That the dearth of talent runs deep in the halls of administration and runs cross sector comes as no surprise, yet now would be a great time for some real leadership from the top.  We\u2019ll survive, sympathetic thoughts should directed (in this singular example) at the double handful of staff whose jobs apparently were created out of the thin air of government largess. Who needs science anyway? Who needs to pay rent and eat? SNAP benefits? Same. If this holds, the short term is going to be messy. A hungry mob is an angry mob.\nI\u2019m unsure how this plays as populism. Selling austerity to the mope masses, what\u2019s in it for us?\nI\u2019m not sure how you get to privatization although that has definitely been on the agenda of many Repubs. But as with SS this is not something they can do without Congress going along. There\u2019s a consent of the governed factor.\nAnd of course many features of these national lands have already been privatized\u2013campgrounds, fees, reservations. Our state parks which used to be free to enter now have entrance stations.\nI don\u2019t think you can trust any Republicans\u2013not just Trump\u2013 to do right by our public lands but the Dems, as in the Clinton admin, are often their collaborators.\n$4.01k update:\nBitcoin is hanging in there, confidently holding the $100k line, occasionally daring the high nineties, establishing a value.\nIt\u2019s performing in the same style as the Mexican Peso did from the late 70\u2019s to early 90\u2019s during their long hyperinflation, albeit in reverse.\nLet me explain\u2026\n1 million Pesos was worth $80,000 US in 1977, and $330 US in 1992.\n\u2018Hype-Inflation\u2019 i\u2019m gonna call it on Bitcoin, yeah that\u2019s the ticket.\nHype-Inflation, also known as HI, for instance \u201cI musta been high\u201d.\nMy REIT-wreck portfolio did a nice job of holding up yesterday, but the stench of NVDA could not be overcome.\nData center REITs are the new edifice wrecks, now the faulty towers, as you put it, have company!\nIf you build it-DeepSeek will come.\nField of Broken Dreams\nWith Kickl at the helm, a new dystopia looms for the Muslim population in Austria.\nMaybe. That wouldn\u2019t have happened though if immigration policies had been subject of democratic control and Austria\u2019s political class responsive to public attitudes. Have you visited Vienna lately? It\u2019s almost like the Ottoman Empire managed to achieve through civil means what it wasn\u2019t able to achieve on the battlefield.\nThis backlash is a reaction. Easily preventable, but now it\u2019s there.\nDidn\u2019t Vienna help this \u201cnew Ottoman Empire\u201d reconquer Yugoslavia first? What kind of grand strategists they have there, if they expected \u201cthe invasion\u201d to just stop before reaching their gates? I see no reason for them to complain, since even the most famous Vienna painter preferred \u201cnew Ottomans\u201d to Orthodox Christians.\nNo, the Austrians pushed very hard for recognition of Croatia (Catholic solidarity) and then helped arm the Bosnian Croats against the Muslims.\nThey pushed very hard for balkanization, and return on their former imperial territories. Putting some silly explanation does not change that (\u201cCatholic solidarity\u201d, \u201canti-Orthodox solidarity\u201d, \u201cVienna painter\u201d solidarity, NATO solidarity, fighting Russians, democracy spreading, whatever). It\u2019s just yet another attempt of WWI/WWII (because third time\u2019s a charm). Since it\u2019s not their first time showing their stratiegic genius, the reward should be appopriate. Make Vienna Ottoman Again, or whatever.\nEarlier in that \u201ccampaign\u201d Croate separatists received a large amount of Soviet mechanized equipment and weapons from reunified German\u2019s excess.\nGermanic crusaders endure.

Amazingly. To this day German MSM mostly ignore matters. Very very slowly some politicians are taking up the baton, but purely due to the election.\nthanks for recommend.\nI am just now watching.\nBut for the record: I do not like TC.\nIf my daughter wore a button to work that read \u201cEff Trump\u201d she\u2019d probably have a few people remind her that the election is over.\nIf she wore a button to work that read \u201cFree Palestine\u201d she would be fired.\n\u201cAmerica, the Home of the Fee and the land of the Grave\u201d\nWhy do I believe that after all the stomping about with ruffled feathers and loud crowing it shall, for the most part, be business as usual?

One has to wonder how much the tech billionaires act as gate keepers controlling what companies/technologies are even allowed to exist. They are easily able to buy out and crush potentially better competing technology. This has been happening at least since Gates was able to turn Microsoft into a giant and crush competing OSs. It\u2019s no longer a place where the best technology wins, it\u2019s where the most money in the hands of a few win.\n\u201cChina has won the hearts and minds of a tiny sinking island nation by providing crayons to school children.\u201d\nThis would be Kiribati, a country that has had no per capita growth since 1977 and has been among the lowest income of all countries.  Kiribati was allied with Taiwan, but since 2019 has been partnered with China, and China is offering assistance from environmental to agricultural to medical and, evidently, to supplying crayons for children.\nKiribati, partnered with China, is now growing and that is, unsurprisingly, encouraging.\nKiribati per capita GDP in 2024 was $3,612 in purchasing power parity terms:\nhttps://fred.stlouisfed.org/graph/?g=1Dfh3\nAugust 4, 2014\nReal per capita Gross Domestic Product for China, Fiji and Kiribati, 1977-2023\n(Indexed to 1977)\nNow US Marines will invade them in order to eat all their crayons.\nhttps://www.globaltimes.cn/page/202205/1266745.shtml\nMay 28, 2022\nWang\u2019s visit to Kiribati shows devt opportunities, injects firmness to one-China principle\nBy Zhang Hui and Hu Yuwei\nChina and Kiribati underscored the remarkable achievements of bilateral cooperation in improving livelihood and economy of Kiribati since the two resumed ties in 2019, during Chinese State Councilor and Foreign Minister Wang Yi\u2019s visit to the South Pacific nation on Friday, vowing to further enhance cooperation in tackling climate change, COVID-19, and building Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) amid the US and Australia\u2019s intensified demonization of China\u2019s role in the region.\nWang\u2019s visit has injected more confidence and firmness in both the government and people of Kiribati for their historical decision to develop ties with China on the basis of recognizing the one-China principle, Chinese analysts said, noting more countries in the region will realize that developing ties with the world\u2019s second-largest economy will bring them unprecedented development opportunities to better integrate into global development, and will help them make independent decisions free of the Western countries\u2019 interference.\nWang arrived in Kiribati on Friday during an eight-nation tour in the South Pacific region. In a meeting with Kiribati President Taneti Maamau, Wang said the president regarded China as a true friend as he received the Chinese delegation at his home.\nBut the US and its allies have focused their efforts on containing China\u2019s development with the essence of not wanting to see non-Western forces succeed in the world and the enhanced cooperation of developing countries, Wang said, noting no one and no force can stand in the way of the development and revitalization of China and other developing nations.\nPresident Maamau said the nation unswervingly adheres to the one-China principle and the resumption in bilateral ties with China proved the world is on the side of China and Kiribati is on the right side of history.\nOn September 27, 2019, China and Kiribati resumed diplomatic ties.\nThe president said the pragmatic cooperation between the two countries has yielded fruitful results and the livelihood of the people in Kiribati has improved, which strongly testified to China\u2019s sincere friendship.\nThe first batch of Chinese medical teams arrived in Kiribati along with the Chinese delegation to help the nation fight against COVID-19, and the two sides also agreed to enhance cooperation on tackling climate change, infrastructure, tourism and promote the BRI construction\u2026.\nThe bear in the video was \u2018fleeing\u2019 not \u2018chasing\u2019.

It is a way of storing hydrogen which does not require such heavy cryogenics as liquid hydrogen does. However, in order to get the hydrogen to separate from the nitrogen in ammonia, you have to use energy, and a lot of it, since making ammonia is very energy-intensive.\nBasically, the chemistry I learned in high school (and I didn\u2019t get a good mark) suggests to me that this is a preposterous scam.\nNothing to see there, move on, folks, but leave your wallets behind.\nYour email address will not be published.

REUTERS/Mike Segar\n    The historian running the memorial to the Buchenwald Nazi concentration camp has spoken out against tech billionaire Elon Musk, in an interview this week with The Times of London.Jens-Christian Wagner, who runs the memorial to the notorious camp near Weimar that held hundreds of thousands of Jewish, Communist, Roma, and other political prisoners of the Nazis, told The Times, \u201cOne can only say to [Musk], \u2018Take a history book and withdraw for three days, read the history book and please be quiet with the poison he\u2019s spreading\u2019.\u201d\u201cI think Musk is a mixture of mad and right-wing extremist and that is particularly dangerous,\u201d Wagner continued.ALSO READ: Inside the parade of right-wing world leaders flocking to D.C. for Trump's inaugurationMusk, who bankrolled much of Trump's voter outreach last year and heads up his \"Department of Government Efficiency\" task force to cut federal spending, has come under fire for making a gesture that has drawn comparisons to a Nazi salute at a Trump inauguration rally. He denies that was his intent and is feuding with Wikipedia over the definition of a Nazi salute.However, Musk has also increasingly endorsed far-right movements in other countries through his X platform, and what particularly draws Wagner's horror is his open support for Alternative f\u00fcr Deutschland (AfD), or Alternative for Germany, an anti-immigrant right-wing extremist party that has been described by some political observers as an ideological successor to the Nazis.\u201cRecently we had a case where pupils were spotted lying down in the ovens of the crematorium and photographing each other. It turned out one of the two boys was the son of a local AfD politician who exerted pressure on the school not to punish them,\u201d Wagner told The Times. \u201cUp to now we\u2019ve not had security cameras in the crematorium for ethical reasons because it\u2019s a place where some people come to grieve. But now we\u2019re going to install cameras there too.\u201dSmartNews",

However, the party's candidate for chancellor, Alice Weidel, who recently held a live chat with Elon Musk after he endorsed AfD on his X platform, has no realistic chance of becoming Germany\u2019s leader as other parties refuse to work with AfD.\nWhile other parties have not called for deportations of migrants in general, a majority of Germans support more and faster deportations of those who don\u2019t receive asylum in Germany. Chancellor Olaf Scholz has vowed several times to step up the deportation of rejected asylum seekers.\nThe number of irregular border crossings into the European Union fell significantly in 2024, according to the bloc\u2019s border control agency Frontex.\nIn Germany, the number of people applying for asylum fell sharply last year.

The party now openly lobbies for remigration. At a party convention on the weekend, Weidel called for closing Germany\u2019s borders to undocumented migration and large-scale deportations of asylum seekers, making clear that she has no problem with the politically charged term \u201cremigration.\u201d\nInterior Minister Nancy Faeser sharply rejected AfD's anti-migration sentiment and warned against dividing Germans into first and second class citizens based on their heritage. Almost 25 million people of Germany's population of 84 million have immigrants roots.\n\u201cThe fact that the AfD apparently wants to expel people en masse under the term \u2018remigration\u2019 shows not only its contempt for humanity, but also how much it would damage Germany as a business location and cost jobs,\u201d Faeser told the daily Rheinische Post on Wednesday.\nGermany is facing a massive skilled labor shortage with experts estimating that the country needs about 400,000 skilled immigrants each year as the workforce ages and shrinks. Companies across the country fear that AfD's anti-foreigner stance will further deter much-needed migrants from moving to Germany for work.\n___\nFollow AP\u2019s coverage of migration issues at https://apnews.com/hub/migration",

            "content": "How well does the \"Middle Kingdom\" know the \"land of virtue?\" Experts in China recently compiled information about German politics and society. Hot topics include Germany's political shift to the right and protectionism.\nIs Alice Weidel really the most popular German politician in China? The leader of the populist, far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) party is probably the only member of Germany's Parliament, the Bundestag, who speaks Chinese.\nAs a student, Weidel researched and wrote her doctoral thesis on the pension system in China. Many reels about Weidel are circulating on Chinese state-controlled social media.\nThe designated AfD candidate for chancellor in the 2025 election is popular in China because she opposes US and EU integration policies.\nThe fact that Weidel could have a chance of becoming German Chancellor is one of countless cliches in China.\nThe social elite in China is well aware that cooperation between China as the world's second-largest economy and Germany as the third-largest can only be sustainable if the public has an objective and nuanced image of Germany.\nChina's \"Annual Development Report of Germany (2024)\" was published in mid-November.\nThe publisher is the German Research Center of Tongji University in Shanghai. Its predecessor, the \"German Medical School for Chinese in Shanghai,\" was founded in 1907 by the German naval doctor Erich Paulun.\nThe 386-page study has not taken into account the latest changes in Germany's politics, such as the coalition government's collapse, and the upcoming snap elections.\nThe majority of the data used is as of 2023. Nevertheless, it is very informative to read how intensively and thoroughly\u00a0Chinese researchers are studying Germany.\nOne of the dominant themes is the rise of the AfD. According to the authors, many people\u00a0in Germany are worried about the overall political and economic situation.\nThe AfD is said to be taking advantage of these concerns to divide and polarize society. \"The strong tailwinds for right-wing populism and its party pose huge challenges for the other established political parties,\" said Xuan Li, Professor at Tongji University.\nWhether the shift to the right can be reversed depends on whether \"the other parties manage to respond appropriately to the mood of the electorate,\" Xuan said.\nThe right-wing populists are seen as advocating a new foreign policy that challenges the established \"politically correct\" alliance with the United States.\nAfter Moscow launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine, for example, the AfD in the Bundestag called for the abolition of sanctions against Russia. \"The political tug-of-war between the AfD and the others will immediately put relations between the US and Germany to the test,\" the authors say.\nOn his trip to the United States in February, Chancellor Olaf Scholz described relations between the US and Germany as \"intensive, close and amicable in a way that has probably not been the case for many years and decades.\"\nAs if the political scientists from China had already foreseen the outcome of the 2024 US presidential election, they made a prediction about the future development of the trans-Atlantic alliance before the editorial deadline.\n\"If Donald Trump were to be reelected, the risk of new disputes and even conflicts arising between Germany and the US in terms of defense and trade would be extremely high,\" the authors wrote.\n\"An appropriate response to the unpredictability of the new US administration would then be a difficult undertaking. After all, we are seeing a surge of nationalism in economic life across borders, from the US to Germany and many other European countries,\" they continued.\n\"This mixture,\" they wrote, \"will put a heavy strain on the future of relations between Germany and the US and the alliance between the two countries in the Ukraine war.\"\nTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video\nThe war in Ukraine is also a joint challenge for Germany and China, German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock made clear during her trip to Beijing earlier this week.\nBoth countries face immense hurdles in overcoming such challenges, Wulf Linzenich, chairman of the German-Chinese Business Association (DCW),\u00a0said at the organization's annual conference in D\u00fcsseldorf on Tuesday.\n\"How can we find a balance between increased cooperation with the US and maintaining an equal partnership with China? The economic engine of the coming decades will undoubtedly be in Asia. Europe will remain an important partner for China in the future. A clear and coherent strategy that takes both sides into account is essential,\" said Linzenich.\nBeijing has not really warmed to the Green foreign minister, as the German government's China Strategy 2023 came from her department.\nThe strategy defines China as a \"partner, competitor and rival.\"\nAccording to Beijing, the political focus is more on the latter aspect. It also calls on the German economy to \"de-risk,\" where dependence on China for critical sectors is to be avoided through diversification.\nThe authors of the report, Kou Kou and Shi Shiwei, write that de-risking is expensive and fraught.\nGermany's economy would have to pay a high price for the political decision to restrict cooperation with China, its largest trading partner globally for the past eight years, they wrote.\n\"Germany is now acutely threatened with a slip into recession,\" according to the authors. \"The leeway in fiscal policy has been exhausted. The German government lacks support for its China strategy within its own ranks and in many other EU countries. The real effects of de-risking fall well short of political expectations.\"\nTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video\nThe authors write that competition is healthy.\n\"Reform and opening up an\u00a0objective cooperation without ideological disputes have brought tangible benefits to both partners,\" they write. \"As the economy strengthens, Chinese companies are competing with the German economy in some areas.

This also applies worldwide to climate protection and the definition of industry standards.\n\"The People's Republic continues to be an important market for German and European companies.

Talib A. criticized Germany's migration policies and expressed extreme sentiments against former Chancellor Angela Merkel. Authorities have confirmed his Islamophobic motivations, but further details on the attack's motive remain unclear. Similar vehicle attacks in Germany have historically been linked to various forms of extremism.",
            "content": "Five people were killed and scores more injured when a car plowed into revelers at a Christmas market in Germany. A man taken into custody at the scene is reportedly a critic of Islam and AfD supporter.\nAfter the deadly December 20 attack on a Christmas market in Magdeburg, a suspect was arrested almost immediately.\nOn the evening of the attack, Saxony-Anhalt's state premier, Reiner Haseloff, said the suspect was a 50-year-old man from Saudi Arabia who had been living in Germany for 18 years and had likely acted alone when he drove through the crowds.\nSeveral German media outlets quickly identified the man as Talib A.* and reported that he was a specialist in psychiatry and psychotherapy. Talib A. was practicing in Bernburg, about 40 kilometers (25 miles) south of Magdeburg, where the attack happened.\nThe Saudi native was raised a Muslim but left his religion\u00a0and became an active critic of Islam and its treatment of women, particularly in his homeland.\nDescribing himself as a former Muslim and a Saudi dissident, he was an enthusiastic user of the social media platform X (formerly Twitter). He had around 47,000 followers there.\nThere he posted or re-posted daily mostly on anti-Islam themes. He often criticized the religion and congratulated Muslims who left the faith.\nAccording to an interview he did with the BBC in 2022, Talib A. set up a website called \"We Are Saudis\" (wearesaudis.net) which he says he used to help Saudi activists and ex-Muslims escape Saudi Arabia and other Gulf countries. He told the BBC he was often approached by younger Saudi women trying to escape\u00a0their families.\nHowever the UK's Daily Telegraph reports that some other dissidents found him too intense and avoided him.\nHis views veered into Islamophobia and he frequently posted content echoing far-right rhetoric. He often criticized Germany's migration policy because he claimed it had allowed too many Muslims into the country and blamed Angela Merkel, Germany's former chancellor, for allegedly allowing that to happen.\nIn December, he shared a video about Afghan women being banned from medical universities by the Taliban and commented that, \"had Merkel achieved her plan, this would have been Germany right now.\"\nThe same day he also posted that, \"Merkel must spend the rest of her life in prison as punishment for her criminal secret project to Islamize Europe. But if the death penalty is reinstated, she deserves to be executed.\"\nThis support for the far right and his concerns about Islam in Europe date back to at least 2016.\nHe became increasingly upset with Germany. \"I have to admit that I was deceived by western Leftists,\" he wrote in another post on X. \"I thought they welcome refugees because they care for human rights. But my experience in Germany showed me that they welcome refugees because they want to Islamise Europe.\u201d\nTaleb A. was also supportive of\u00a0Germany's far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) party.\u00a0\"The AfD and I are fighting the same enemy,\" he wrote on social media.\nHe also praised far-right figures like the Netherlands' Geert Wilders and UK extremist Tommy Robinson, as well as\u00a0X owner, billionaire Elon Musk.\nTalib A. actively sought media exposure for his cause. In 2019, he and the website were featured in media reports across Germany, the UK and other countries, including the Frankfurter Allgemeine newspaper.\u00a0Talib A. had also been in contact with Deutsche Welle. DW has released this statement about that contact:\n\"Talib A., the alleged perpetrator of the Christmas Market attack in Magdeburg, was in contact with DW.\nIn March 2021, the 50-year-old doctor from Saudi Arabia reached out through Twitter. He accused Saudi Arabia and Saudis in Germany of spying on him. He also accused the German authorities of not taking him seriously and not taking any action.\nIn a message to DW in October 2023, he wrote: \"They refused to even open an investigation! On the grounds that there is no public interest. [\u2026] They leave a Saudi refugee exposed to intimidation, surveillance and persecution without even conducting an hour-long investigation to get at least a first impression.\"\nHowever, many of his claims could not be independently verified by DW.\nIn November and December 2024, he offered to appear on DW and publicly present evidence. After receiving no reply, he broke off contact.\"\nOnly a few days before the Magdeburg attack, he gave an interview to the RAIR Foundation, a website known for featuring vaccine-skeptical and anti-Muslim content.\nAlthough the RAIR Foundation later replaced the December 12 interview with a completely different text, archived versions of the site show that he gave another similar interview.\n\"Germany \u2014 and much of the West \u2014 is not only facilitating the Islamization of their societies but is actively persecuting legitimate refugees fleeing Sharia oppression,\" he claimed in the interview. \u00a0He also alleged that Germany was \"waging war on ex-Muslims.\"\nOn his personal X account, he claimed he had evidence of German authorities committing \"a series of deliberate crimes against Saudi refugees.\"\n\"I assure you that if Germany wants a war, we will fight it,\" he wrote in one post \"If Germany wants to kill us, we will slaughter them, die, or go to prison with pride.\"\nDespite Talib A.\u2019s various posts and his increasingly extreme political opinions, German authorities have yet to release information as to what they think his motive was in driving into the Magdeburg Christmas market.\n\"We can only say with certainty that the perpetrator was obviously Islamophobic,\" Germany's Interior Minister Nancy Faeser told reporters on Saturday.\nThere have been a number of similar incidents with vehicles in Germany over recent years. The best-known is likely a terrorist attack on a Berlin Christmas market\u00a0on December 19, 2016, by Islamist extremist Anis Amri. In that dozens of people were injured and 13 died. Amri was apparently motivated by calls from the extremist \"Islamic State\" group to carry out low-cost attacks on the West.\nBut other attacks were linked to mental illness and\u00a0far-right extremism.\nIn 2022, a mentally ill man drove into a busy shopping street in Berlin, killing one person. In 2020, another man drove into a crowd celebrating in the small town of Volkmarsen\u00a0in the state of Hesse. His motivation has never been clarified as he refused to speak to investigators.\n*Editor's note: DW follows the German press code, which stresses the importance of protecting the privacy of suspected criminals or victims and urges us to refrain from revealing the full names of alleged criminals.\nThis story was updated on December 21.\nTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video",

Follow DW for more.\nAfter a driver plowed into a Christmas market in Magdeburg, Germany, killing five people, concerns have been raised about public safety and intelligence gaps.\nFive people, including a 9-year-old boy, were killed and more than\u00a0200 injured on Friday night when a car plowed into a crowd at the eastern German city's Christmas market.\nPoliticians across the spectrum, from the far-left to the far-right, are calling for enhanced security measures.\nPolice have yet to determine the motives behind Friday's attack. The perpetrator, a doctor from Saudi Arabia, is currently in pre-trial detention, facing charges of murder, attempted murder, and dangerous bodily harm.\nInvestigators are examining reports that there had been warnings about a potential threat from the perpetrator.\nIn the first opinion poll to be released after the Magdeburg attack, Germany\u2019s political landscape looks largely unchanged ahead of February's election.\nAccording to the poll, published by the\u00a0tabloid Bild newspaper and conducted by German polling institute INSA, the conservative CDU/CSU is still the biggest political force, garnering 31%\u00a0voter support and losing half a percentage point from the previous INSA survey.\nThe far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) maintained its position as the second most-popular party, with 19.5% support.\nThe\u00a0Social Democratic Party (SPD), would receive 16% of the vote, having lost half a percentage point from the previous INSA poll.\u00a0Germany\u2019s environmentalist Greens gained one point and now have 12.5% backing.\nThe left-wing populist Sahra Wagenknecht Alliance (BSW) remain at 8%.\nThe business-friendly Free Democrats (FDP) are at 5%, which is the exact threshold to enter the German parliament, or Bundestag.\u00a0The Left Party, meanwhile,\u00a0are still under that\u00a0threshold with 3% support.\nGerman investigators found a will left in the car used by the perpetrator of Friday night's attack on the Magdeburg Christmas Market, according to Germany's Der\u00a0Spiegel news magazine.\nIn the will, the attacker, who presumably expected to die during the attack, states that his entire fortune should be donated to the German Red Cross.\nIn May 2024, he had posted on \"X\" that he expected to die \"this year,\" a warning which he repeated in several private messages to other \"X\" users, reports Spiegel.\nThe will and testament reportedly did not contain any political messages.\nHundreds of people formed a human chain around the Alter Markt in Magdeburg on Monday evening in a gesture of remembrance for the victims of Friday night's attack on a Christmas market held on the same square.\nThe initiative, named \"Don't Give Hate a Chance,\" was also intended to be a stand against right-wing extremists seeking to exploit the attack for political gain.\nOrganizers said thousands took part, with people of all ages standing together in dense crowds. Holding candles, they applauded and thanked the emergency services \u2014\u00a0the police officers who had apprehended the perpetrator and the medical teams who had treated the over 200 wounded.\n\"These are lights for a cosmopolitan city,\" said Oliver Wiebe, one of the organizers.\nThe event took place at the same time as a demonstration led by the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) party on the Domplatz just across town, where attendees had chanted for \"deportations!\"\nLocal newspapers in Magdeburg and the surrounding areas of eastern Germany have warned against what they consider the \"instrumentalization\" of Friday night's attack while calling\u00a0on the authorities to investigate security failures thoroughly.\nIn Magdeburg itself, the local Volksstimme newspaper wrote:\n\"Three days on from the attack, and despite all appeals to the contrary, the political instrumentalization has begun. The right has blamed all migrants for the crime, while the left says it was the result of far-right radicalization. With the federal election coming up [in February], it's a battle for control of the narrative. In the end, it will lead to little \u2014\u00a0only to a further division of society. After all, the profile of the perpetrator can be interpreted in several ways.\n\"But that doesn't mean that [the attack] doesn't require investigation. Because, when people lose trust in the state's ability to protect them, the political center and ultimately democracy itself are endangered. We saw what that means on Saturday when groups of far-right demonstrators using sinister language could be observed.\"\nAnd in Cottbus, a city in the neighboring state of Brandenburg,the Lausitzer Rundschau newspaper wrote:\n\"One need not only look at the demonstrations by right-wing extremists to see that many more protagonists will be looking to score political points in relation to this attack. The CDU [Christian Democratic Union] wants to start turning [migrants] back at the borders again. But what does that have to do with the terror in Magdeburg? The terrorist arrived here legally, lived here legally, worked here legally \u00a0and evidently fell into madness here.\n\"As correct as it is to investigate the precise circumstances of this terrible crime and the security failures before it, the political instrumentalization is equally disingenuous. Regardless of who is doing it.\"\nGermany's far-right populist Alternative for Germany (AfD) party staged a demonstration on Magdeburg's central Domplatz on Monday evening in response to Friday night's deadly Christmas market attack.\nPrecise attendance figures were not immediately available, but footage appeared showed many people on the square listening to speeches made by AfD politicians, including chancellor candidate Alice Weidel and Jan Wenzel Schmidt, the AfD's leader for the state of Saxony-Anhalt.\n\"Someone who hates \u2014\u00a0and kills \u2014\u00a0the people of the country that gave him asylum, who hates all we stand for and all that we love, does not belong to us,\" said Weidel, who had traveled to Magdeburg from Berlin.\n\"We want things to finally change in this country so that we will never again have to mourn with the mother who has lost her son in such a pointless and brutal way,\" she continued, describing the attack as \"an act of an Islamist full of hatred for what constitutes human cohesion ... for us Germans, for us Christians.\"\nThe perpetrator of the Christmas market attack is a Saudi man who came to Germany in 2006. In social media posts, he called himself an atheist who renounced Islam and attacked German migration policies as too lenient. He also expressed sympathy for the AfD, saying it pursued the same goals he did.\nWenzel Schmidt called the attack a \"monstrous political failure\" on the part of the authorities who had granted the \"mass murderer\" asylum despite him having publicized his intentions (see entries below). Individual police officers, he said, had had their \"hands tied\" and been \"left alone\" by their superiors.\nDuring the demonstration, which was titled \"Grief unites \u2014 for a secure future,\" attendees intermittently chanted for \"deportations.\"\nAfter the speeches, the AfD is set to lead a march around the city center.\nSimultaneously, several counter-demonstrations took place with slogans such as \"We want to mourn \u2014\u00a0give hate no chance\" and \"Give fascism no chance.\"\nState police in Saxony-Anhalt\u00a0received a warning regarding the perpetrator of Friday night's Christmas market attack back in autumn 2023, but they didn't respond, local public broadcaster MDR reports.\nOn September 27, 2023, a member of the public contacted the police via direct message on Instagram, writing in English: \"There's a guy [who] said he's going to kill random German citizens, please do something and arrest him as soon as possible. Please answer, it's very urgent.\"\nThe warning also featured screenshots of posts made by the eventual perpetrator on \"X.\"\nAccording to MDR, the tipster had also contacted Germany's Federal Office for Migration and Refugees (BAMF) and police in Berlin, both of which had directed them to police in Saxony-Anhalt.\nAcknowledging the warning, BAMF said on Monday: \"This tip, like many others, was taken seriously.

The country's far-right is instrumentalizing the incident to stoke fear and hatred.\nThe motive of Talib A.*, the suspected perpetrator of the deadly Christmas Market attack in Magdeburg, is still unclear. What has been confirmed\u00a0is that he is a Saudi citizen and that he is in custody.\nNevertheless, shortly after the attack, the extreme-right scene in Germany began to antagonize migrants.\n\"I have never experienced such a hostile and threatening environment,\" said a student studying automotive engineering in Magdeburg, the capital of the eastern state of\u00a0Saxony-Anhalt.\nSalam, a violence prevention center in Saxony-Anhalt, gave a similar account. The association has observed a significant increase in incidents against people seen as foreigners by right-wing extremists.\nTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video\nAccording to Salam, \"perceived migrants are branded as 'terrorists,' 'criminals' and 'lowlifes,' some are pushed around and spat at.\"\nThreats have gone so far that migrant communities have warned each other in WhatsApp groups and on Facebook against going out in public.\nThat the perpetrator of the Magdeburg attack is suspected of being an Islamophobe and a right-wing extremist is a paradox, Hans Goldenbaum, a radicalization expert at Salam, told German broadcaster MDR. \"It shows the power of this right extreme discourse and how sealed off he is from reality.\"\nSince the Christmas market attack on December 20, extreme-right\u00a0and neo-Nazi parties, associations and individuals have mobilized across Germany,\u00a0demanding the mass deportation of migrants.\nHundreds of neo-Nazis gathered at an extreme-right\u00a0rally in Magdeburg on December 22, two days after the attack. The demonstration saw aggression against journalists.\nOne of the speakers at a rally on Sunday was Thorsten Heise. A\u00a0militant neo-Nazi with several previous convictions, he once tried to run over a refugee with his car. Videos of the rally show Heise calling on the demonstrators to infiltrate associations, fire departments and authorities.\nJournalists and observers reported that participants in the rally shouted \"Wake up Germany,\" a phrase used during Nazi Germany under Adolf Hitler. Its usage is a punishable offense in Germany.\nAccording to police estimates, up to 3,500 people \u2014 including political party leaders and known extremists from the local hooligan scene \u2014 attended a demonstration promoted by the nationalist\u00a0far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) . Clothing and tattoos common among white supremacists were visible.\nAs AfD co-leader Alice Weidel spoke, the audience chanted: \"Deport, deport, deport.\" After the demonstration, attendees took to the streets. They attacked photographers, shouted nationalist slogans and tested the strength of the accompanying police.\nDavid Begrich, a right-wing extremism expert from the association Miteinander in Magdeburg, expects a broader politicization of the Christmas market attack. The\u00a0AfD\u00a0political party has organized large demonstrations in Magdeburg. Begrich strongly criticized the demonstrations, saying the focus after the attack should remain on the five victims and the 200 others wounded.\n\"I am witnessing great bewilderment and shock in Magdeburg,\" he told DW. \"This attack has deeply wounded the city. That also applies to me personally: my wife was one of those injured.\"\nBegrich said he thinks no one should politicize the attack as long as there are victims in the hospital.\u00a0\"The fate of the victims must be the main focus,\" he said. \"The reappraisal comes afterward. Communities do not want any politicization.\"\nDespite all the fake news, speculation and attempts at politicizing the deadly attack on social media, Begrich sees his city as truly affected by the tragedy.\n\"The city is coming together,\" he said.\n*Editor's note: DW follows the German press code, which stresses the importance of protecting the privacy of suspected criminals or victims and urges us to refrain from revealing the full names of alleged criminals.\nThis article was originally written in German.\nThis article was originally published on December 23, 2024, and updated on December 24, 2024, to include details of a rally promoted by the Alternative for Germany party.",

Germany's Christmas markets and festivals have come under attack before, mainly from extreme Islamists.\nHe has been described as critical of Islam and he also voiced support on social media for the far-right Alternative for Germany party, hailing the party for fighting the same enemy as him \"to protect Germany\".\nThe AfD has not commented on those posts. The party held a rally in Magdeburg later on Monday where co-leader Alice Weidel called for change \"so we can finally live once again in security\". The crowd responded with calls of \"deport them\" according to news agencies.\nHer party is currently riding high in the opinion polls ahead of federal elections on 23 February, especially in states like Saxony-Anhalt in the former East Germany.\nThis attack has brought two big elections issues to the fore, security and immigration, and AfD figures have highlighted both since the attack.\nDespite the suspect's many statements expressing hostility to Islam, the head of the AfD in Sachsen-Anhalt, Martin Reichardt, said in a statement \"the attack in Magdeburg shows that Germany is being drawn into political and religious fanaticism that has its origins in another world\".\nIn a post on X, Weidel said the government's discussion of new security laws following the attack \"must not distract from the fact that Magdeburg would not have been possible without uncontrolled immigration.

We want to organise solidarity across society, but at the same time we are also sensitive to the voices of those who are now reacting with fear and uncertainty.\"\nGerman President Frank-Walter Steinmeier made a plea for national unity, saying \"a dark shadow hangs over this Christmas\".\n\"Hatred and violence must not have the final word. Let's not allow ourselves to be driven apart. Let's stand together!\" he said.\nGermans are asking how the attack could have happened, when security was already heightened at Christmas markets and when authorities had clearly investigated the suspect several times in recent years.\nThe threat he posed was considered \"too unspecific\", according to one assessment, while one tip-off against him in September 2023 appears to have fallen through the cracks.\nIn another apparent security failing, the driver was also able to get through a gap that had been left open for emergency access when it should have been filled by a police van.\nStallholders at the Christmas market have now been allowed to come back, to throw away old food and remove their equipment and stocks.\nNone that I approached wanted to speak to the BBC. It's all too raw.\nThere has also been hostility towards journalists over the past few days, especially after some 2,000 people joined a protest by the far right in Magdeburg on Saturday night.\nThe Association of German Journalists said there had been aggression and threats against the press and appealed for greater police protection.\nThe BBC team joined mourners gathered in Cathedral Square for a live stream of the vigil for victims of the attack and many who spoke to them said it was important to show solidarity at a time of terrible distress.\nBut one woman struck a note of caution.

Saudi sources said four official notifications known as \"Notes Verbale\" were sent warning German authorities of his \"very extreme views\".\nAlthough Saxony-Anhalt police did investigate him, he was never considered a threat because he had exhibited no violence before. Any potential threat was judged \"too unspecific\".\nMagdeburg police chief Tom-Oliver Langhans said police had conducted a threat assessment, \"but that discussion was one year ago\".\nAuthorities may have been wary of Saudi warnings. A counter-terrorism expert told the BBC the Saudis may have been mounting a disinformation campaign to discredit someone who tried to help young Saudi women seek asylum in Germany.\nIn 2013 Abdulmohsen was fined for breaching the peace by making a series of threats, and his flat was searched by the police. Then the following year he threatened to carry out acts that would command \"international attention\" if he did not get the support he wanted, officials said.\nAt the time he was living in northern Germany, and in 2015 he is alleged to have made threats on a hotline that he would get hold of a gun and take revenge on judges in his previous cases, reports say.\nBy 2016 he was granted asylum apparently on the grounds of political persecution, and in recent years he has accused several people of being spies for the Saudi government, according to German reports, and was himself accused of defamation.\nA picture has built up of a man who studied psychiatry and then worked from 2020 in a correctional facility for criminals in Bernburg, without being very good at his job.\nHis employer said he had been off work since October because of leave and illness, but a colleague told the local Mitteldeutsche Zeitung\" (MZ) they called him \"Dr Google\" because he always had to check his diagnosis online first.\nIn the meantime he was active on social media, promoting conspiracy theories regarding an alleged plot by German authorities to Islamicise Europe, and re-tweeting posts from the leader of the AfD and a far-right activist.\nHe maintained a website designed to help ex-Muslims flee the Gulf region.

He also went on to speak of his empathy for all those who were forced to \"experience this repulsive act.\"\nKober called the incident one of the biggest acts of domestic terror the country has ever seen, saying he expected upwards of nearly 1,000 people could be in need of psychological and practical assistance.\n\"The experience can be accompanied by great psychological stress,\" he said, adding, \"Those affected should not think that they can cope with it alone. The earlier help is sought, the lower the risk of the damage becoming chronic.\"\nKober also announced Saturday that those in need could reach out for psychological help by calling a special toll-free hotline at 0800 - 000 95 46.\nAs mourners gathered in and outside Magdeburg Cathedral to pray for the victims of Friday night's deadly Christmas market attack, members of the far-right made their presence known as they marched through the streets of the city.\nMarchers chanted \"We are the people!\" and carried large placards reading \"Heimat\" (Homeland) and \"Remigration.\"\nPolice, who accompanied the protesters through the streets, estimate that roughly 1,000 people have joined the demonstration.\nChancellor Olaf Scholz, Federal President Frank-Walter Steinmeier and Saxony-Anhalt State Premier Reiner Haseloff were among those in attendance at a memorial service for the victims of Friday night's attack on a Magdeburg Christmas market that killed five and injured over 200.\n\"Last night's brutal attack leaves us saddened and angry, helpless and fearful, uncertain and desperate, speechless\u2026 stunned and deeply affected.

The horrific attack does not fit the known pattern, he said.\nThis obliges \"us politicians to pause for a moment and only assess what happened yesterday on the basis of reliable information,\" Merz wrote\u00a0on X.\n\"It remains intolerable that we can only gather with fears and worries and can no longer celebrate carefree. We must stop this. But on this day, compassion, grief and help are more important,\" Merz said and emphasized. \"Our country stands together.\"\nMerz had traveled to Magdeburg today together with Chancellor\u00a0Olaf Scholz\u00a0and several ministers.\nAccording to the far-right populist Alternative for Germany (AfD) party, the alleged suspect in the Magdeburg Christmas market attack was not a member of the party.\n\"We can rule out that the perpetrator from Magdeburg was a member of the AfD,\" a spokesman for party leader Alice Weidel told the Rheinische Post, adding that there had never been a membership application.\nSupport\u00a0for the AfD had been expressed in a post on an X account under the name of the suspect, who was arrested after the attack.\nThe account describes him as a former Muslim. It is filled with tweets and retweets that focus on anti-Islamic themes and criticism of the religion.\nA\u00a0minute's silence will be held at first and second-division\u00a0football matches across Germany\u00a0for\u00a0the victims of the attack in Magdeburg, the German Football League (DFL) said.\n\"German professional football is shocked by the attack on the Christmas market in Magdeburg,\" the DFL, which runs the Bundesliga,\u00a0wrote in a statement.\n\"The DFL recommends wearing a black armband of mourning for this weekend's Bundesliga and second division... and supports a minute of silence in tribute to the victims.\"\nThe German handball match between SC Magdeburg and Eisenach, scheduled for Sunday, was postponed.\n\"Out of respect for those affected and their families, we have decided to request that the match be postponed.

Experts predict that domestic security and migration will dominate upcoming campaign discussions, with the AfD and other right-wing parties likely to criticize the government\u2019s handling of security. A fairness accord has been established among six parties, excluding the AfD and the pro-Russia Sahra Wagenknecht Alliance.",
            "content": "With a general election in February, it didn't take long for politicians to try and exploit the attack on Magdeburg's Christmas market. Domestic security will likely become a key election campaign issue.\nThe first efforts to instrumentalize Friday's deadly ramming of the Magdeburg Christmas market came less than an hour after the attack. False rumors circulated that there were\u00a0five attackers, three of whom were still on the loose, that they had arrived in Germany as refugees from Syria in 2015 and 2016, and that it wasn't just a car that had killed at least 34 people, but a bomb placed at the site of the holiday festivities.\nAustrian nationalist Martin Sellner, a leading figure in European Identitarian networks, was one of the most prominent spreaders of the disinformation. Politicians from the far-right\u00a0Alternative for Germany (AfD) soon joined in the efforts to capitalize on the attack, in which at least five people were killed by a suspect identified as Talib A.*, a Saudi citizen who has lived in Germany since 2006 and has apparently expressed admiration for the AfD.\n\"Only the AfD would have deported the man long ago,\" Sven Tritschler, the deputy chairman of the AfD\u00a0in the state parliament of North Rhine-Westphalia, posted to social media.\nDominik Kaufner, an AfD member of the Brandenburg state legislature, posted to social media that \"millionfold migration is the problem and millionfold remigration is the solution.\"\nIn her own post, AfD member of the state parliament in Lower Saxony\u00a0Vanessa Behrendt\u00a0blamed rival German parties such as the center-left Social Democrats (SPD), the center-right Christian Democrats (CDU), Greens and the Left Party: \"They are responsible for this. They alone.\"\nThe suspect Talib A. is apparently an open critic of Islam and an AfD sympathizer.\u00a0In 2016,\u00a0he wrote on X,\u00a0\"I and AfD are fighting the same enemy to protect Germany.\"\nTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video\nWith an eye on federal elections scheduled for February, AfD leader Alice Weidel,\u00a0the party's candidate for the chancellorship, wrote on social media: \"When will this\u00a0madness come to an end?\"\nBenjamin H\u00f6hne, a political scientist at the Technical University in Chemnitz, whose research focuses on German parties, told DW: \"The trend is going more and more to the right. Right-wing narratives spread. An open migration policy that attempts to recognize global human rights has already fallen out of favor. Catastrophic events such as what happened in Magdeburg will likely exacerbate that.\"\nThe German news agency DPA\u00a0has reported that the government of Saudi Arabia had previously tipped off German officials that the suspect, a vocal dissident, could be a threat. The pro-Russia\u00a0Sahra Wagenknecht Alliance (BSW), which also campaigns on restrictive migration policies, has lashed out at German Interior Minister Nancy Faeser, saying she must answer \"why so many tips and warnings were ignored\" ahead of Friday's attack.\nNoting recent fatal knife attacks in the cities of Solingen and Mannheim, BSW\u00a0leader Sahra Wagenknecht called for \"a convincing security plan with a clear focus on the protection of the population.\"\nH\u00f6hne said: \"It is to be\u00a0expected that parties, especially on the right, will attempt to attack the interior minister and the SPD on the topic of security. The SPD has responsibility for the Interior Ministry and domestic security on the federal level, so\u00a0it will try\u00a0not to end up on the defensive\u00a0because of Magdeburg.\"\nHistorically, the CDU and its\u00a0Bavarian sister party the Christian Social Union (CSU) have been the parties that have positioned themselves as stronger when it comes to domestic security. H\u00f6hne said it was likely that security and migration would be at the center of\u00a0debates in the coming campaign, as they had been in recent state elections in eastern Germany.\nThere is an increasing emphasis on \"securitization\" in German politics, according to H\u00f6hne. \"That means that migration is almost exclusively discussed as a potential or actual security risk,\" he\u00a0said. \"With that, other facets of migration are pushed to the background \u2014 such as, for example, how to address Germany's labor shortage or attract skilled workers. I fear that the attack in Magdeburg will further strengthen this bias.\"\nSix parties have agreed on a fairness accord ahead of the federal elections. SPD, CDU, its Bavarian sister party CSU, Greens, FDP and the Left Party said they would not stoop to personal humiliations or attacks on the personal and professional circles of politicians during their campaign. They also agreed to debate with each other respectfully and refrain from using disinformation to gain political advantage.

An ally of US President-elect Donald Trump's and the owner of the social network X, Musk has\u00a0already endorsed the AfD in the coming elections. Shortly after\u00a0the attack in Magdeburg, he demanded that German Chancellor Olaf Scholz stepped down, calling him an \"incompetent\u00a0fool.\"\n\"Government institutions and officials should consider whether their continued presence on\u00a0X\u00a0is politically advisable. It should be clear that Elon Musk is using his company X to push\u00a0his political agenda\u00a0in Germany. German federal government institutions shouldn't\u00a0tolerate it,\" H\u00f6hne said.\nThat didn't stop\u00a0Musk from taking it one step further.

He allegedly supports the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) party, which is currently in second place in opinion polls.\n\u201cYesterday\u2019s horrific act in Magdeburg does not fit the pattern we have seen so far,\u201d said Friedrich Merz, leader of center-right Christian Democratic Union and on course to become Germany\u2019s next chancellor. \u201cThis obliges us politicians to pause for a moment.\u201d\nWhile the motive of the attack remains unclear and the background of the alleged suspect confounds initial theories that it was committed by an Islamic terrorist, the tragedy still puts the spotlight on Germany\u2019s attitude to immigration and border control.\nChancellor Olaf Scholz, whose center-left party looks set to lose power in February, described the attack as a \u201cterrible, insane act\u201d and said \u201cthose who want to sow hatred\u201d wouldn\u2019t win.\nBut Scholz faces important questions over the next few days about what was known of the suspect, his identity was confirmed by prosecutors as Taleb Al Abdulmohsen, a 50-year-old man. While prosecutors gave almost no details about the suspect, German media said Abdulmohsen is a Saudi Arabian psychiatrist who moved to Germany in 2006.\nThe Magdeburg chief prosecutor, Horst Walter Nopens, did indicate a Saudi connection.\n\u201cIt looks like the background to the crime could have been \u2026 dissatisfaction with the treatment of Saudi Arabian refugees in Germany,\u201d Nopens told a press conference on Saturday. \u201cBut what is deeper behind this is the subject of the investigation,\u201d he said.\nInterior Minister Nancy Faeser said the authorities can \u201csay with certainty that the perpetrator was obviously Islamophobic.\u201d\nThe chief prosecutor said the suspect is in police custody and has made a statement about the motive for the crime, but he declined to give any details about that statement. The investigators \u201cdo not yet know whether it was a terrorist attack,\u201d Nopens said.\nLate Saturday, a Magdeburg court approved pretrial detention for the suspect, the police said.\n\u201cThe judge ordered pretrial detention for five counts of murder, multiple attempted murder and multiple counts of dangerous bodily harm,\u201d the police said in a statement early Sunday.\nIn the immediate aftermath of the attack on Friday evening, right-wing parties seized on reports that the driver was a man from Saudi Arabia. The incident took place almost eight years to the day after a terrorist drove a truck into a Christmas market in Berlin.\nMigration has become a huge issue in Germany, which took in large numbers of refugees from Syria under former Chancellor Angela Merkel in 2015. With external commentators from Elon Musk, an adviser to United States President-elect Donald Trump, to Nigel Farage, leader of Reform UK, already commenting on Friday\u2019s tragedy, it has the potential to steer the debate even further in that direction.\nSeveral German media outlets identified the alleged attacker before prosecutors confirmed his name. WELT, a sister publication of POLITICO in the Axel Springer group, said the Saudi Arabian was granted refugee status in 2016.\nGerman media also reported that the alleged attacker was an AfD supporter. In 2019 interviews with Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung and Frankurter Rundschau, Abdulmohsen described his online anti-Islam advocacy and initiatives to help Saudis apply for asylum. \u201cI am the most aggressive critic of Islam in history. If you don\u2019t believe me, ask the Arabs,\u201d he said.\nOn his purported X account, Abdulmohsen claimed that \u201cGermany wants to islamize Europe\u201d and accused German police of \u201cusing dirty tactics against me and other critics of Islam \u2026 to destroy our anti-Islam activism.\u201d\nThe AfD, along with other far-right European parties, was quick to jump on reports that the alleged perpetrator was an immigrant. Alice Weidel, chair of the AfD, pointedly asked \u201cWhen will this madness end?\u201d while expressing her condolences for the victims of the attack.\nAt least five people were killed, including a child, according to the premier of Saxony-Anhalt, Reiner Haseloff, of the CDU. Some 200 others were injured in the attack, the prosecutors said.\nGermany\u2019s election, triggered by the collapse of a three-party coalition led by Scholz, is scheduled for Feb. 23.\n\u201cThere is no more peaceful and friendly place than a Christmas market,\u201d Scholz said on Saturday. \u201cNow it is important that \u2026 we don\u2019t let those who want to sow hatred get away with it, but that we also don\u2019t let the perpetrators go unprosecuted and that we take action with the full force of the law,\u201d he said.\nThe CDU\u2019s Merz has outlined a conservative vision for how he will govern, saying he will sharply reduce the number of asylum-seekers being allowed to settle in Germany.\nIn recent polls by Forschungsgruppe Wahlen on the main concerns of German voters,\u00a0the economic crisis overtook migration.\nThis could swing back after the attack, as it did following a killing at a festival this summer in Solingen in western Germany. Nevertheless, the leading parties have already adopted a tougher stance on migration in their election manifestos. The conservative CDU, like the AfD, wants to introduce border controls for Germany and make it easier to deport refugees.\nGerman Vice Chancellor Robert Habeck described the attack as \u201cterrible news\u201d in a place \u201cwhere people wanted to spend the Advent season in peace and community.\u201d Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock expressed shock at the incident and sent condolences to the victims and their families.\nThursday marked the eighth anniversary of the attack on Berlin\u2019s Breitscheidplatz Christmas market when Islamist Anis Amri killed 12 people with a truck. Another victim later died from his injuries.\nThis article has been updated.\nChancellor Olaf Scholz\u2019s latest demand is likely to stall a \u20ac3 billion aid package to the war-ravaged country as Russian forces continue their advance.\n\u201cThe objective exchange of arguments is becoming increasingly difficult\u201d on the platform formerly known as Twitter, says defense ministry.\nThe EU\u2019s strategy to deal with the far-right Freedom Party heading for power in Vienna is \u2026 hope for the best.\nConservative chancellor candidate Friedrich Merz railed against the climate policies of the left-leaning parties he\u2019ll likely have to govern with.",

Now, let's do it then: The AfD wants to leave NATO, reactivate Nord Stream 2, and is anti-US, pro-Putin and pro-Russia. Is that what the USA wants? A Germany that turns towards Russia and away from the USA? The AfD wants to leave the Eurozone, our by far largest trading partner. We conduct ~40% of our trade within Eurozone. Without the Euro and the EU, the German economy would completely collapse.\"\nSpahn said the AfD had also been against the construction of the Tesla factory in Gr\u00fcnheide.\nGermany is set for a snap election on February 23\u00a0after the\u00a0coalition government led by Chancellor Olaf Scholz collapsed last month.\nThe three parties in the coalition had disagreed for more than a year on major policy issues, including the 2025 budget.\nThe AfD is now running second in opinion polls with around 19% support, behind the conservative CDU/CSU alliance with more than 30%.\nHowever,\u00a0Germany's mainstream\u00a0parties have all ruled out working with AfD at the national level.\nmm/dj (AFP, DPA)",

            "content": "Having tapped his vast personal wealth and marshaled his 210 million followers on X to help propel Donald Trump to election victory in November, Elon Musk has turned his gaze to European politics.\nIn a post on X late Wednesday, Musk called for the release of Tommy Robinson, a British far-right agitator, saying he was in jail for \"telling the truth.\" Robinson, whose real name is Stephen Yaxley-Lennon, was jailed last year for breaching a court order not to repeat false claims about a refugee from Syria. Robinson had been successfully sued for defamation over the claims.\nMusk then posted that Britain should have an election \u2014 the most recent one took place in July \u2014 and claimed its government was reluctant to hold an inquiry into child sexual exploitation to protect the prime minister, Keir Starmer. He was the country's chief prosecutor when a series of high-profile court cases about gangs targeting children shook the nation.\nThe posts are Musk's most aggressive intervention in European politics and follow months of commentary, particularly on events in the UK and Germany.\nOn Tuesday, Musk urged British voters to back Reform UK, a populist party led by Nigel Farage, a key figure in the UK's 2016 referendum to leave the EU.\nThe Tesla and SpaceX CEO \u2014 who has embraced conservative stances on issues such as immigration, diversity, and transgender rights in recent years \u2014 met with the conservative firebrand Farage in mid-December at Trump's Mar-a-Lago resort.\nFarage later told the BBC that Musk was \"fully, fully behind us\" and open to donating to Reform UK if he could do so legally. The party has made no secret of its excitement about Musk and his potential financial support, with Farage describing him as a \"bloody hero\" in a recent interview with the UK's Daily Telegraph.\nMusk has been a vocal critic of Starmer. In numerous X posts, he's called the country a \"tyrannical police state\" and suggested the nation was on the brink of civil war.\nThe people of Britain have had enough of a tyrannical police state https://t.co/0PtR5qQOKw\nThe tech billionaire has also thrown his weight behind the German far-right party the AfD, which has come out strongly against immigration and echoed Trump in calling for mass deportations.\nThe AfD holds about 10% of the seats in Germany's legislative body, the Bundestag, but it has made significant gains in recent years, including coming second in this year's European Parliament elections.\nIt is widely expected to win the second-highest share of votes in the Bundestag election in February and, like Reform UK, has welcomed Musk's support. Its candidate to become Germany's chancellor, Alice Weidel, said Musk was \"perfectly right\" when he said in an X post on December 20 that the party was the only one that could \"save Germany.\"Musk then championed the AfD in an op-ed published in the German newspaper Welt am Sonntag on Sunday. The paper and Business Insider are both owned by Axel Springer.\nMusk wrote that years of misguided policies by the main political parties had led to \"economic stagnation, social unrest, and the erosion of national identity,\" and the AfD represented the \"last spark of hope\" for the country. He justified his German political commentary by pointing to his \"significant investments\" in the country.\nMusk's Tesla Gigafactory just outside Berlin is the company's main European facility and employs close to 12,000 people. It produces components such as batteries, and the final assembly of the Tesla Model Y is completed at the factory.\nThe paper printed a response by its editor-in-chief-designate, Jan Philipp Burgard, on the same page as Musk's controversial column. Burgard wrote that \"Musk's diagnosis is correct,\" but his claim that only the AfD can save Germany is \"fatally flawed.\"\nBefore the op-ed, Musk's posts on X in support of the AfD prompted a government spokesperson to accuse him of attempting to meddle in the election, Reuters reported.\nThe spokesperson said that Musk was free to express his opinions, however, he said, \"Freedom of opinion also covers the greatest nonsense.\"\nFriedrich Merz, the center-right Christian Democratic Union's candidate for chancellor, described Musk's backing of the AfD as \"intrusive and pretentious.\"\n\"I cannot recall in the history of Western democracies a comparable case of interference in the election campaign of a friendly country,\" he told the Funke media group.\nIn his New Year's Eve message, Vice Chancellor Robert Habeck said Musk's support of the AfD was part of a \"logical and systematic\" campaign to weaken Europe and erode its regulatory system.\nSeveral of Musk's businesses, most notably Tesla, are subject to European regulations and stand to benefit from reduced oversight. Tesla's plans for fully self-driving cars face increased hurdles in Europe, where regulations on autonomous vehicles are more stringent.\nMusk has also spoken fondly of Italy's right-wing prime minister, Giorgia Meloni. In September, he called her a \"precious genius\" who was \"even more beautiful on the inside than she is on the outside.\"\nMeloni leads the Brothers of Italy party \u2014 which has roots in the post-World War II neo-fascist Italian Social Movement. She came to power in 2022, campaigning on a platform of lower immigration, tighter border control, and traditional values. At the time, she was described as Italy's most right-wing leader since Benito Mussolini.\nThis is unacceptable. Do the people of Italy live in a democracy or does an unelected autocracy make the decisions? https://t.co/MdVUbt1jbF\nTrump's agenda of tax cuts, tariffs, and deregulation would likely benefit Musk's companies. Tesla's stock surged after Trump's election victory. But it's less obvious what Musk and his companies would gain from the rise of those he backs in Europe.\nNot only are AfD and Reform unlikely to form governments soon, both also have policies that could hurt Tesla.\nThe AfD has opposed the extension of Tesla's German factory, while Reform has pledged to reverse a looming ban on the sale of gas and diesel cars in the UK, which would benefit EV makers like Tesla.\nThe AfD is polling in second place at 19%, more than the 12.6% it won in the last election in 2021. Musk posted to X Monday that it would win \"an epic victory.\" Whether it makes those predicted gains or not, the party will no doubt continue to welcome the support of the world's most outspoken billionaire.\nJump to",

Musk's involvement in various political issues has raised concerns about his growing role in international politics, despite his primary focus on technology and business.",
            "content": "Opinion It's been a busy month in the political brain of Elon Musk. The tech, automotive, and space entrepreneur has gone from mulling a donation to the Reform UK party worth around $100 million to calling its leader unfit.\nMusk may have founded SpaceX, which is credited with transforming private sector space transport, but his political positioning seems less reliable. The current fallout with Reform UK's leader \u2013 Nigel Farage, a well-known figure on the British populist right \u2013 stems from Farage's refusal to consider far-right activist Tommy Robinson among Reform's ranks.\nFor Musk, it seems Farage and his allies were not quite right-wing enough, and he let his 210 million X followers know about it.\n\"The Reform Party needs a new leader. Farage doesn't have what it takes,\" he posted on the social media platform formerly known as Twitter at the weekend.\nFarage may have reason for being wary of Robinson, who was jailed for contempt of court in the UK after repeating false claims about a Syrian refugee. Robinson had previously been found in contempt of court in 2019, following appeal, after his breach of reporting restrictions risked the collapse of a trial.\nYou'd think that someone with more than three companies to run who is also co-leader of the proposed US Department of Government Efficiency would have something better to do with his time than pay attention to Reform UK, the seventh-largest political party in terms of seats in the House of Commons. Obviously, Musk works on another level.\nNonetheless, Musk is keen on voicing his political opinions and even more keen for them to be heard.\nIn 2022, he bought Twitter for $44 billion \u2013 only after a court case forced him to do so following his attempt to back out of the deal. The new ownership allowed a raft of previously banned personalities back onto the platform, and the company's estimated value has since collapsed to less than a quarter of what Musk paid for it.\nDespite promising to make Twitter politically neutral, Musk went in for some vigorous backing of US President-elect Donald Trump, reportedly plowing a quarter of a billion dollars into the twice-impeached former president's campaign and lavishing Trump's rallies with his dubious bodily coordination.\nMusk's recent meddling in European politics has prompted condemnation from EU leaders. Norway's prime minister, Jonas Gahr Stoere, said it was worrying that the billionaire was involved in the political issues of countries outside of the United States. Meanwhile, French president Emmanuel Macron denounced the Tesla CEO's maneuvering as \"unacceptable interference\" in the region's politics. \"Ten years ago, who would have imagined that the owner of one of the world's largest social networks would be supporting a new international reactionary movement and intervening directly in elections, including in Germany,\" Macron warned.\nThis was likely a reference to last month's comments by Musk about the right-wing party Alternative f\u00fcr Deutschland (AfD), saying \"only the AfD can save Germany,\" and backing this up with an opinion piece published in German newspaper Welt am Sonntag, a move that led to the resignation of the outlet's opinion editor.\n\"The portrayal of the AfD as right-wing extremist is clearly false, considering that Alice Weidel, the party's leader, has a same-sex partner from Sri Lanka!\" he wrote. \"Does that sound like Hitler to you? Please!\"\nGerman Chancellor Olaf Scholz, who Musk also called a \"fool,\" gave an unusually frank interview to German current affairs mag Stern and said that he wasn't bothered by Musk's insults, although the billionaire's support for the AfD was disturbing.\n\"Germany is a strong and stable democracy \u2013 Musk can say what he wants. In Germany, the will of the citizens prevails, not the erratic statements of a billionaire from the USA,\" he said.\n\"I don't believe in courting Mr Musk's favor. I'm happy to leave that to others. There are many people on social media who want to attract attention with shrill slogans. The rule is: Don't feed the troll.\"\nYesterday, UK prime minister Sir Keir Starmer stepped in after Musk launched a vitriolic attack on one of his ministers. \"Those who are spreading lies and misinformation as far and as wide as possible are not interested in victims [of crime], they're interested in themselves,\" he said.\nThis is unlikely to be the end of it. Musk has also blessed Ukraine and Canada with his political expertise, and he just seems to be having too much fun to give up on his newfound hobby.\nIn December, Musk took to his social media platform to mangle a quote from Plato. \"Those who want power are the ones who least deserve it,\" he said. Staggeringly, he seemed to miss the irony that he has used his vast wealth to exert political power. While the South Africa-born billionaire's achievements in technology and engineering speak for themselves \u2013 whatever your view of them \u2013 the jury is certainly out on his political ambitions. \u00ae\nSend us news\nThe Register   Biting the hand that feeds IT\nCopyright.

If the AfD were to exceed expectations and emerge as the largest party, Weidel is unlikely to become chancellor, as all of Germany\u2019s mainstream parties have ruled out entering a coalition with the AfD.\nHowever, CDU leader Friedrich Merz \u2013 who is widely expected to become chancellor \u2013 said on Friday that his party would introduce tough anti-immigration laws, even if it has to count on the AfD to pass them.

This is very important.\nYou know, it\u2019s okay to be proud to be German. This is a very important principle. It\u2019s okay.\nIt\u2019s good to be proud of German culture and German values and not to lose that in some sort of multiculturalism that dilutes everything.\nWe want to have unique cultures in the world. We want to have people, we don\u2019t want everything to be the same everywhere where it\u2019s just one big sort of soup.\nWe want to have something where you go to different countries, and you experience a different culture, and it is unique, special, and good.\nThat the German government takes action to protect its citizens and make sure that it seeks the health and well-being of the German people.\nThe German people are an ancient nation that goes back thousands of years.\nALICE WEIDEL: MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!\nThe AfD LOVES DONALD TRUMP!\n\u201cWe wish you, President Donald Trump and Vice President JD Vance, all the best to Make America Great Again! You\u2019re the best!\u201d\nCan you imagine how amazing a MAGA- and DOGE-inspired Germany could be? pic.twitter.com/QVvnGgSmUt\n\u2014 Naomi Seibt (@SeibtNaomi) January 25, 2025\nI was reading Julius Caesar\u2019s account of first encountering the German tribes in the Gaul campaigns, and he was like, wow, very impressive. These are very powerful warriors.\nSo, I think there\u2019s too much of a focus on past guilt, and we need to move beyond that.\nChildren should not be guilty of the sins of their parents, their great-grandparents, maybe even.\nYou should be optimistic and excited about a future for Germany. That\u2019s really my message, is be optimistic, excited, and preserve German culture and protect the German people.\nThere are some other things that I think would be very helpful too, which is you want more self-determination for Germany and for the countries in Europe, and less from Brussels. That\u2019s my opinion.\nI think there\u2019s too much bureaucracy from Brussels, too much control from the global elite. When I\u2019ve given talks at these global government conferences, what I\u2019ve said is there should be less global government.\nThere should be more determination by individual countries.\nTrending: Menendez Stuns Reporters with Remarks About Trump After Being Sentenced to 11 Years in Prison (VIDEO)\nAnd so, I very much hope that the AfD does well, and that Alice Weidel does become Chancellor. I think that would be very good for Germany.\nI hope that your people unite and strongly support AfD.\nSo, you\u2019re doing the right thing, is what I\u2019m saying. Let\u2019s go, guys! Let\u2019s go. Fight for a great future for Germany!\nConvince your friends, convince everyone. If you want to make the future great, if you want the future to be great, you need to make it great and fight for the future to be great. That\u2019s how it becomes great.\nI think we should fight for an exciting, bright future where people can be optimistic about what\u2019s going to happen.\nWhere you wake up, and you look forward to the future, and the best way to ensure the future is good is to fight for a good future every day. And it will be great.\nSo, I think this election coming up in Germany is incredibly important. I think it could decide the entire fate of Europe, maybe the fate of the world. That is the significance of this election.\nSo, that\u2019s why it\u2019s very important to talk to your friends and family and convince them to consider voting for AfD. And then, just go with it, like a chain reaction. Convince one friend, talk to another friend.\nDo you want this? Do you want more of the last 10 years? Or do you want something different?\nI think the people in Germany want something different. And if you want something different, you have to vote for a different party. This is just a fact, this is logic.\nSo, you are the future of Germany. Make it happen.\nBut I can\u2019t emphasize enough: Go out there, talk to people, convince people, one vote at a time.\nThere\u2019s a need for change. And this election is so important, it\u2019s extremely important. I do not say it lightly. I think the future of civilization could hang on this election.\nObviously, you have my full support. I think the Trump administration is also supportive.\nI think the policies that I\u2019ve heard from AfD make a lot of sense. They\u2019re really just, to me, when I look at the policies, they\u2019re common-sense policies just like President Trump has common-sense policies.\nGetting things done, getting the government out of people\u2019s way so that you can get things done and give people back personal freedom, and protecting the people from dangers.\nThese are fundamental things that, frankly, the current government is not doing.\nThe current government is suppressing speech very aggressively.\nAnd really, when you suppress freedom of speech, it\u2019s very difficult, if not impossible, to have a true democracy because freedom of speech is the foundation of democracy.\nPeople cannot be expected to vote in an informed manner if they are not able to know the truth.\nSo, this is why it is so important to have freedom of speech, so people can make an informed vote, and it can be a true democracy.\u201d\nWHAT ALICE WEIDEL REALLY THINKS ABOUT ELON MUSK\nAfD chancellor candidate Alice Weidel was mocked as an \u201cElon Musk fangirl\u201d after their space went viral.\nShe shuts down the haters with her usual coolness:\n\u201cI am a fangirl of free speech\u201d pic.twitter.com/7c5eL9UtGm\n\u2014 Naomi Seibt (@SeibtNaomi) January 23, 2025\nElon Musk\u2019s interview with Alice Weidel on Jan. 9:\nDie Unterhaltung mit Elon Musk im Video \u2013 mit deutschen Untertiteln.

Instead, he has increasingly cast his attention overseas to Europe, offering incendiary analysis on X while boosting a host of far-right figures and causes across the continent, including calling for the release of jailed British ultra-nationalist Tommy Robinson and meeting with right-wing Brexit figure Nigel Farage.\nAmerica should liberate the people of Britain from their tyrannical governmentJanuary 6, 2025\nIn one recent instance, Musk hosted German ultra-right-wing politician Alice Weidel, who used her X-hosted conversation with Musk to ahistorically claim that Adolf Hitler was \"a leftist.\" Weidel, whose hardline Alternative for Germany (AfD) party has been labeled by the country's domestic intelligence agency as a potential far-right extremist group, is a \"very reasonable person,\" Musk said during their conversation. \"Nothing outrageous is being proposed.\" Things are going to get \"very, very much worse in Germany\" if Weidel's AFD doesn't win in that country's upcoming elections, he said. Is there more to Musk's flirtation with Europe's far-right than meets the eye?\nEscape your echo chamber.

He is \"building his empire and he is testing how far he can go.\" The question, said Bloomberg, is \"whether he has an endgame beyond provocation, and what that might be.\" Musk \"sees himself as a savior of U.S. democracy from the progressives,\" said Jos\u00e9 Ignacio Torreblanca, senior policy fellow at the European Council on Foreign Relations, to The Wall Street Journal. \"He thinks this should not stop at home and that it should continue in Europe.\"\nDespite engaging with and boosting \"parties with authoritarian leanings, including Germany's AfD\" Musk is not actually working toward a \"government-centric authoritarianism like fascism,\" said Elad Nehorai at MSNBC. Instead, he is working toward a world \"in which business swallows government and becomes the actual ruling class.\" And there are more immediate business interests that may have Musk's attention as well. He faces the \"possibility of hundreds of millions of dollars in fines\" related to his X platform's alleged violations of the European Union's Digital Services Act, which \"requires online behemoths to block and remove false content,\" said The Washington Post's Lee Hockstader.\nMusk's renewed focus on European politics also comes as \"new registrations for Musk's electronic vehicles fell 13% in the first nine months of 2023\" across the continent, The Associated Press said. \"In Germany, Tesla registrations dropped 44%.\" Musk used his conversation with AfD's Weidel to opine about the regulatory hurdles he faced opening a Tesla plant in Germany. \"I think it was 25,000 pages was our permit. And it had to be all printed on paper,\" Musk said. \"And then there has to be many, many copies made. So it literally was a truck of paper.\"\n\"It is no secret that Tesla was against the government funding for electric charging stations in Germany,\" said German Chancellor Olaf Scholz, \"suggesting Musk's comments stem from business dissatisfaction,\" said the country's DW broadcaster.\nIf Musk puts the \"same amount of money into all of Europe that he put behind Trump, he will flip every nation to a populist agenda,\" said MAGA podcaster and longtime Trump ally Steve Bannon to Bloomberg. At the same time, however, some heads of state are \"pressing the European Commission to use its legal arsenal against Musk's perceived interference,\" Reuters said. In Germany, where Musk's comments prompted harsh backlash from elected officials, \"several high-profile organizations and users in Germany have already quit X, including the country's highest criminal court,\" said DW. The German government, however, has \"decided against doing so for now.\"\nFor Germany's Scholz, meanwhile, there is only one course of action to counter Musk's ongoing political meddling: \"Don't feed the troll.\"\nA free daily email with the biggest news stories of the day \u2013 and the best features from TheWeek.com\nRafi Schwartz has worked as a politics writer at The Week since 2022, where he covers elections, Congress and the White House.

It is up to a judge to decide whose right weighs stronger.\nIn the German criminal code, there is a whole category of \"crimes of honor\" (\"Ehrdelikte\") that\u00a0includes everything from spreading lies about another person to defamation. The code makes certain kinds of statements punishable as insults, slander, or defamation. It\u00a0also declares as\u00a0illegal the propagation of\u00a0false statements about an individual that harm her or his\u00a0personal or professional reputation or cause\u00a0financial losses or emotional distress.\nThe offense of \"insult\"\u00a0(\"Beleidigung\") comes with a maximum penalty of two years in jail, although perpetrators normally get no more than\u00a0a fine. If the insulted person insults back, judges\u00a0generally dismiss the case.\nImprisonment is very rare, and harsh punishments are an option only for repeat offenders or when the insult is seen as being in combination with racism or\u00a0antisemitism.\nA defamation case is taken on\u00a0by the relevant court\u00a0only at the request of the harmed party, who\u00a0must first file a police report.\u00a0There then needs to be a police investigation.\u00a0The person pressing charges is also required\u00a0to get an attorney to deal with the case and needs to prove the offender's guilt to the judge.\nAs a result, in most cases, insults are not reported\u00a0\u2014\u00a0and the politicians insulted by Elon Musk on social media have not indicated any intention to press\u00a0charges.\nHowever, recently, there have been several cases where German politicians have taken legal action against insults, especially on social media.\nEconomy Minister Robert Habeck from the Green Party, for example, authorized prosecutors to pursue \"insult\" charges \u00a0\u00a0for a social media post referring to him as an idiot (Schwachkopf).However there are indications that law enforcement had first invited or asked Habeck to press the charges.\nHabeck was also insulted as an idiot\u00a0by Musk in a post on X in November.\nGreen Party supporters, in particular, have increasingly become targets of\u00a0attacks. Local politicians\u00a0have also been physically\u00a0attacked, threatened and insulted.\nThe US billionaire's next show of support for the AfD is expected to come soon: According to an AfD spokesperson, concrete plans are being made for a meeting between Musk and AfD leader Alice Weidel on the X-Space chat feature.\nWhile you're here: Every Tuesday, DW editors round up what is happening in German politics and society.

In a recent interview with the German magazine, Spiegel, Green chancellor candidate Robert Habeck was asked if he believed Musk to be a danger to Germany.

The combination of immense wealth, control over information and networks, the use of artificial intelligence and the will to ignore rules is a frontal attack on our democracy. Just because he comes across as relaxed and builds electric cars, we should not be deceived. There is only one answer: Hands off our democracy, Mr. Musk! We cannot afford to be careless or naive. Germany has long been in the sights of foreign actors \u2013 especially now during the election campaign. They see Germany as an easy target. Unfortunately, disinformation campaigns have a relatively easy time of it here.\n\nI guess from Habeck\u2019s viewpoint, it is just fine for a European billionaire like George Soros, with murky ties to the Nazis in his youth, to interfere in U.S. politics, but it is intolerable for a U.S. billionaire to tweet a few words about the current German ruling establishment. It seems a little unfair to Musk. After all, it is not like Musk is funding a paramilitary group such as ANTIFA to stir up trouble prior to the presidential election. Moreover, as far as I know, Musk is not pouring millions into the campaign coffers of prosecutors who will go on to unleash a crime wave across their country. Musk is just stating the obvious that the current German ruling elites are fools.\n\nLife is full of ironies though and one might live to see the next German Chancellor award said U.S. billionaire with the Medal of Freedom just as our fading, feckless leader has done for said European billionaire.\n\n\nImage: Free image, Pixabay license.\n\u201cHands off our Democracy\u201d has now become the rallying cry of the German ruling establishment and press.

            "content": "On January 27, Germany commemorates the victims of Hitler's Nazi regime. Eighty years on, Berlin seeks to strengthen and preserve the nation's memory culture amid attempts at Holocaust denial by the far right.\nOutside the German Bundestag, flags are flying at half-staff, and inside, wreaths have been placed at the speaker's lectern. Many members of parliament are dressed in black, as are many guests. Dignitaries give speeches, which are received by\u00a0devout applause.\nEvery year since 1996, this is how the Nazis' victims have been memorialized at the Bundestag on January 27 \u2014\u00a0a date internationally known as Holocaust Remembrance Day. The day marks the anniversary of the 1945 liberation of the Auschwitz concentration and extermination camps, and the\u00a0commemoration is central to Germany's \"culture of remembrance.\"\nThere are more than 300 memorial sites and Nazi documentation centers across Germany. Schoolchildren learn about National Socialism in history lessons. Some of them also visit former concentration camps, where memorials teach them about the atrocities committed by the Nazis.\nAs a nation, Germany experienced large-scale war crimes trials, such as the Auschwitz trials. German companies have traced their own historical involvement in Nazi crimes. Even to this day, elderly wardens of Nazi killing centers are still on trial.\nHolocaust Remembrance Day is a reminder of the darkest chapter in German history. Nazi Germany sparked World War II, with its many millions of deaths, and was responsible for the systematic murder of 6 million European Jews, as well as\u00a0hundreds of thousands of other victims of Nazi terror: Sinti and Roma were targeted, as were political opponents, homosexuals and people with disabilities.\n\"Remembrance culture is a collective knowledge about \u2014\u00a0and remembrance of \u2014\u00a0the past,\" said\u00a0Saba-Nur Cheema, a political scientist and journalist. \"In Germany's case, the memory of the Holocaust is central, as well as an examination of National Socialism.\" Other themes have become increasingly important in recent years, such as East Germany's postwar dictatorship\u00a0and Germany's role as a colonial power.\nTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video\nYoung people might think that Germany always cultivated a culture of remembrance.\u00a0However, the attorney general who brought the criminal acts in Auschwitz to trial in Frankfurt in the face of great resistance, Fritz Bauer, is reputed to\u00a0have said in the 1960s: \"Enemy territory begins when I leave my office.\" Bauer was Jewish. He only survived the Nazi era by fleeing to Sweden.\nHolocaust Remembrance Day for the victims of National Socialism was only instituted in Germany in 1996. It has never been designated a public holiday.\nThe commemoration of Nazi crimes has often been targeted with hostility \u2014\u00a0especially by the extreme right\u00a0and right-wing populists in Germany. Jens-Christian Wagner, director of the Buchenwald and Mittelbau-Dora Memorial, a former Nazi concentration camp near Weimar, has taken a clear stance against the Alternative for Germany (AfD) party in Thuringia. In the past, Wagner\u00a0has accused the party of containing far-right elements \u2014\u00a0and has written on X that he has received threats.\n\"Almost all memorial sites face vandalism and Holocaust denial. But you also see the debate intensifying locally,\" said Veronika Hager from the Remembrance, Responsibility and Future (EVZ) Foundation, part of whose mission is to keep the memory of National Socialist persecution alive. \"Statements we would have rejected 10 years ago as relatively extreme in society as a whole\u00a0are now much more popular.\"\nTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video\nAfD co-leader Alice Weidel recently made the following statement during a TV interview: \"There is no doubt that Adolf Hitler was an antisemitic socialist \u2014\u00a0and antisemitism is primarily left-wing.\" That aligns with earlier statements made by AfD colleagues, such as former head Alexander Gauland, who famously played down the Nazi era as simply \"bird poop in history.\"\n\"The goal is to soften up the situation, so that we end up not even talking about what happened. The danger is that the threat posed by right-wing nationalist groups could then become intangible and no longer concrete,\" said Cheema.\nMichel Friedman is one of many journalists who, for years, have been drawing attention to growing antisemitism and racism. He is highly critical of the current \"culture of remembrance.\"\n\"If we had done our homework, this shameless and brutal hatred of Jews would not be rampant,\" he said in an interview with the German news magazine\u00a0Der Spiegel.\nFor him, as well as for Jewish organizations and associations in Germany, the \"culture of remembrance\" is too ritualized, too anchored in the past.\n\"As important as it is to deal with the dead Jews,\u00a0our responsibility must lie with the living Jews. And life in Germany is not good for them,\" he said.\nIn recent years, the number of incidents and attacks attributed as antisemitic have risen in Germany. For some, this proves that this nation's \"culture of remembrance\" has failed.\nThe country's culture of remembrance and the protection of Jewish life are often considered intrinsically linked: lessons from the past are meant to produce responsibility today. However, Joseph Wilson, an antisemitism\u00a0expert at\u00a0the EVZ Foundation, said\u00a0such an assumption expects the culture of remembrance to produce something it cannot.\n\"A culture of remembrance is not the same thing as preventing and combating antisemitism,\" said\u00a0Wilson. The compassion one might feel while visiting a memorial site does not automatically translate into the present day, and it does not lead to people recognizing antisemitic codes and conspiracy theories in society.\n\"Instead, we have to realize that our antisemitism prevention concepts have failed in parts,\" he said.\nMany aspects of Germany's culture of remembrance have been discussed and debated by historians and in the media, with some disputing\u00a0the singularity of Nazi crimes, for example. The massacre by Hamas on October 7, 2023, and the ensuing war on Gaza, with its tens of thousands of deaths, represent another schism \u2014\u00a0and\u00a0exposed a fracture in German society.\nFor example, the phrase \"Never again is now\" can have radically differently meanings in Germany today. The slogan was generally used to express the sentiment that the Nazi crimes must never happen again, and many people interpret it as an expression of solidarity with Jews and Israel. However, that same slogan has also been shouted in solidarity with Palestinians at pro-Palestinian demonstrations since the war in Gaza began more than 15 months.\nEver since former Chancellor Angela Merkel's famous speech at the Israeli parliament in 2008, when she declared Israel's security to be \"a reason of state for Germany\", support for Israel has often been understood to be part of Germany's responsibility \u2014\u00a0part of its culture of remembrance. For some in Germany, that means its culture of remembrance is non-inclusive, and not designed for today's mixed immigrant society. But journalist Cheema disagrees.\n\"I wouldn't say that it wasn't designed for that. Because civil society itself shapes a culture of remembrance,\" she said.\u00a0Germany's full support for Israel at the start of the Gaza war, however, which it justified with its own history, was sharply criticized, \"including by many young immigrants.\" Cheema said they posed questions like: \"Why are Palestinians suffering in this way now?\" Indeed, \"it's not a bad question to ask,\"\u00a0she added.\nShe believes the slogan, \"Free Palestine from German guilt!\", often chanted at protests, is primarily a political message and not an attack on the culture of remembrance.\u00a0The Research and Information Center on Antisemitism in Berlin, on the other hand, assessed the slogan in a report as a \"desire to draw a line under the Nazi past.\"\nDiscussions like these are perhaps a sign that there are many \"cultures of remembrance\" in Germany \u2014\u00a0not just one.\nTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video\nVeronika Hager from the EVZ Foundation suggests one way to move forward.\n\"There are so many things we can specifically examine in our daily environment. For instance, company trainees could review their own firm's activities during the Nazi era, or one could find out which residents in specific houses were murdered. Such activities could be undertaken with young people, whether they have an international background, or not,\" she said.\nWhat's generally little discussed in Germany are the biographies of perpetrators in one's own family. Journalist Friedman, who is Jewish, once said, \"You know, there are millions of contemporary witnesses! Look what your grandparents, great-aunts and great-uncles did!\"\nThat could perhaps be the next step in the development of Germany's culture of remembrance. \"I don't ever want to get to the point where we say: 'So, now we have the perfect culture of remembrance,' and put a check mark beside it,\" said Hager. \"For me, it's always something discursive that moves and develops.\"\nThis article was originally written in German.",

Six million people were killed in the Holocaust as the Nazis attempted to eliminate the Jewish race.\nIn front of the so-called \u201cDeath Gate,\u201d through which more than a million Jews and other prisoners were led to their deaths, the survivors gathered in a heated tent, joined by heads of state and delegates from across the world.\nThey lit candles and laid wreaths of remembrance for the estimated 1.1 million people who perished at the camp.\nTova Friedman, who was 2 years old when she was taken to the camp at Auschwitz, is the youngest of the survivors.\n\u201cWe were victims in a moral vacuum,\u201d she told delegates. \u201cBut today, however, we have an obligation not only to remember, which is very, very important, but also to warn and to teach that hatred only begets more hatred.\u201d\nAuschwitz liberation\nOn Jan. 27, 1945, Red Army troops liberated Auschwitz, the largest of the six Nazi extermination camps. What they found continues to haunt humanity.\nNo media source currently available\nIndustrial-scale human slaughter spread across a vast factory complex of dormitories, gas chambers, crematoria and mass graves \u2014 the apparatus of a regime determined to wipe out the entire Jewish race. A genocide conducted over 4-and-a-half years, planned and executed with meticulous detail.\nIt was part of the Nazis\u2019 \u201cfinal solution to the Jewish problem\u201d \u2014 a strategy of mass murder agreed at the Wannsee Conference in 1942.\nAn estimated 1.1 million people were killed at Auschwitz-Birkenau, around 960,000 of them Jews. Poles, Roma, homosexuals, Soviet prisoners of war and other nationalities were also murdered in the thousands.\nVictims were stripped of their clothing and forced into packed chambers filled with cyanide-based Zyklon-B gas. By summer 1944, an estimated 12,000 people a day were being gassed to death.\nThousands of others were shot or beaten to death or died from disease, starvation and exposure. Bodies were burned or buried in mass graves.\n'Burning bodies'\nJanina Iwanska was taken to Auschwitz by train from another Polish transit camp in August 1944 at age 14.\n\u201cAs soon as I got off the wagon, I was immediately hit by the smell, the one I knew from Treblinka [concentration camp] \u2014 the smell of burning bodies,\u201d she told Reuters.\n\u201cThere were small children there who were brought with their mothers. After leaving the \u2018disinfection\u2019 room, they were separated, torn off them. The mothers almost ripped the hands of these children off because they did not want to let them go. Besides, some of the children could not recognize their mothers, because not only were the clothes different but also the heads. A shaved head and a head with hair are two completely different heads,\u201d Iwanska said.\nAs Red Army troops approached the Auschwitz-Birkenau camp from the east, Nazi soldiers attempted to cover up their crimes. Around 60,000 prisoners were forcibly transferred in so-called \"death marches\" to other camps farther west. It\u2019s estimated that up to 15,000 died along the way.\nBy the time the Russian troops entered Auschwitz, around 7,000 prisoners remained, most on the brink of death. Thousands died before receiving medical help.\n\u2018Culture of remembrance\u2019\nGermany now embraces \u201cErinnerungskultur,\u201d an official \"culture of remembrance,\" or a duty to take responsibility for the Holocaust.\n\u201cWe keep alive the memory of the breach of civilization committed by Germans in the Holocaust and convey it to every generation in our country again and again. Our responsibility never ends,\u201d German Chancellor Olaf Scholz said ahead of the anniversary.\nBut the 80th anniversary comes amid growing fears over the rise of the far-right in Germany, Europe and beyond. Such concerns were voiced by many Auschwitz survivors, including Leon Weintraub, who was deported to Auschwitz in 1944 and now lives in Sweden.\n\"Be attentive and be vigilant,\u201d Weintraub told delegates. \u201cWe, the survivors, we understand that the consequences of being considered different is active persecution, the effects of which we have personally experienced on our own skin. So, let us be very serious, and let us take seriously what the enemies of democracy preach. They generally seek to implement these slogans they promote,\u201d he said.\nGerman fears\nThe German government has repeatedly warned of the dangers of the Alternative for Germany (AfD) Party, which is polling in second place, or around 20%, ahead of February elections. The AfD is being monitored by German intelligence services as a potentially \u201cextremist\u201d party.\nIn a recent televised conversation with Elon Musk, the U.S. billionaire and ally of President Donald Trump, AfD\u2019s leader Alice Weidel said Nazi leader Adolf Hitler was not right-wing but a \u201ccommunist.\u201d\nSpeaking at an AfD conference Saturday by video link, Musk, who is an open supporter of the party, questioned Germany\u2019s approach to its past.\n\u201cI think there\u2019s frankly too much of a focus on past guilt, and we need to move beyond that. Children should not be guilty of the sins of their parents or even let alone their parents, the great-grandparents, maybe even,\u201d Musk said.\nIsrael conflict\nThe Hamas cross-border attacks on Oct. 7, 2023, and the brutal Israel-Hamas war in Gaza, have overshadowed memorial events in Israel.\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu did not attend the Auschwitz commemorations. Netanyahu faces an International Criminal Court arrest warrant for suspected war crimes committed during Israel\u2019s war on Hamas, which he strongly denies. The United States, a close ally of Israel, has condemned the warrant and threatened sanctions against the court in The Hague.\nPoland assured Netanyahu that he would not be arrested if he attended the Auschwitz memorial events. However, the Israeli prime minister instead spent Monday in a Tel Aviv court as his long-running corruption trial resumed. Israel was instead represented by Education Minister Yoav Kisch.\nRelatives of the dozens of Israeli hostages still held by Hamas in Gaza traveled to Poland for the Auschwitz liberation anniversary, while survivors of the Oct. 7, 2023, massacre joined survivors of the Holocaust for commemorative events in Israel.",

We strongly condemn acts of sabotage to critical undersea infrastructure.\nWe are determined to deter, detect and counter any attempts at sabotage. Any attack against our infrastructure will be met with a robust and determined response. We stand ready to attribute hostile actions committed by malign actors, as appropriate.\nWe welcome that NATO has launched the enhanced Vigilance Activity \"Baltic Sentry\" to improve situational awareness and deter hostile activities. We welcome the efforts of Allies to deploy additional assets at sea, in the air, on land and below the surface of the sea, to enhance vigilance and deterrence. The Commander Task Force-Baltic in Rostock has been activated and coordinates Allied ships in the Baltic Sea. NATO\u00c2\u00b4s Maritime Centre for the Security of Critical Undersea Infrastructure and NATO\u00c2\u00b4s Critical Undersea Infrastructure Network will support efforts to protect and secure vital undersea assets.\nMoreover, the involved nations are coordinating the employment of different options and assets.  As an example, the Commander Task Force-Baltic works towards establishing an integrated regional picture on critical infrastructure in the Baltic Sea that contributes to NATO's work in protecting critical undersea infrastructure.\nWe continue to strengthen our deterrence and defence, modernise our capabilities, recognising the urgent need for increased defence expenditure to address and counter evolving security threats.\nWe will work, including within the NATO framework, to begin deploying innovative solutions, developing new technologies for surveillance and tracking of suspicious vessels and undersea monitoring. This will include enhanced partnerships with the private sector, in particular infrastructure operators and cutting-edge technology companies. We will actively exchange information, track and assess incidents to analyse trends, and share best practices of our response.\nWe remain prepared to act individually and collectively to protect our critical undersea infrastructure and increase resilience, including by building on and expanding the existing NATO-EU cooperation. We welcome additional measures undertaken by Allies and partners to strengthen security in our region, which reinforce existing and planned NATO responses.\nTogether, we will identify further measures in accordance with international law of the sea, including the freedom of navigation, to prevent and effectively respond to willful damaging of critical undersea infrastructure or irresponsible behaviour. Such behaviour interferes, inter alia, with the freedom to lay cables and pipelines and poses a significant risk to the marine environment. We will also take actions for accountability and stronger enforcement against those responsible for damaging undersea infrastructure, including compensation for damage.\nWe will take further steps to enhance resilience of our communications network and energy infrastructure, including reliable supply chains, enhancing physical and cybersecurity measures, developing European undersea surveillance capabilities and swift repair capacity, engaging with the private sector. We will work towards a Memorandum of Understanding on Critical Infrastructure Protection in the region.\nCombatting breakage of undersea cables and pipelines represents a global problem. We urge all States to adhere to their obligations to adopt laws and regulations necessary to provide that the breaking of or injury to a cable or pipeline in the high seas or exclusive economic zones by a ship flying their flag or by a person subject to their jurisdiction shall be a punishable offence, and to prosecute as appropriate.\nRussia\u00c2\u00b4s use of the so-called shadow fleet poses a particular threat to the maritime and environmental security in the Baltic Sea region and globally. This reprehensible practice also threatens the integrity of undersea infrastructure, increases risks connected to sea-dumped chemical munitions, and significantly supports funding of Russia's illegal war of aggression against Ukraine.\nWe are taking robust steps to address these threats. We reserve our rights, in accordance with international law, to take action against any suspected vessels that circumvent sanctions and threaten our security, infrastructure and the environment. In close coastal state co-operation, we are increasing surveillance of the vessels, including the inspections of vessel insurance certificates. Additionally, further measures, including the introduction of tracking tools and the extension of sanctions targeting the shadow fleet, will be put into practice. We encourage further EU-NATO cooperation in responding to the threats caused by the reckless activities of vessels serving Russian cargo flow.\nIncreasing the security of the Baltic Sea and its critical undersea infrastructure is a joint interest for the Alliance and the EU. Through our joint actions, as outlined in this declaration, we actively contribute to efforts to secure and safeguard our undersea critical infrastructure, thereby strengthening NATO's collective efforts and advancing NATO's ongoing work, including the renewal of NATO's maritime strategy, as we approach the NATO Summit in the Hague.\nHostile or reckless actions against critical undersea infrastructure or other critical infrastructure are not limited to the Baltic Sea region.

The German leader wants the EU to seal more free-trade agreements with countries in South America and beyond.\nMacron has a different take on trade. The French president was furious when despite his staunch opposition, the European Commission in December pushed ahead and completed negotiations on a free-trade accord with the South American Mercosur bloc, an agreement backed by Germany.\nSimilar differences came to light when France last year convinced the commission to raise import tariffs on Chinese electric cars, a move opposed by Germany since it feared Chinese retaliation on German auto manufacturers.\nFrance and Germany will also have trouble finding common ground on security and defense. While Scholz is in favor of loosening Germany\u2019s strict borrowing limits to finance more defense spending at home via debt, he is opposed to Macron\u2019s proposal to go for another round of joint European borrowing to fund defense initiatives.\nIn February, Macron caught Scholz off guard when he didn\u2019t exclude the possibility of sending Western ground troops to Ukraine during a press conference in Paris that followed a meeting of EU leaders that included the chancellor. The German leader quickly shot down the proposal.\nDuring Wednesday\u2019s meeting, Scholz and Macron will also broach the topic of European regulation of US tech giants.\nScholz and Macron will discuss how both governments can support the EU in its efforts to shield citizens from the growing threat of misinformation and hate speech on social media platforms like Elon Musk\u2019s X and Mark Zuckerberg\u2019s Facebook and Instagram, said the people.\nAs the EU\u2019s Digital Services Act provides the toolbox for protective measures, Scholz and Macron are likely to agree that Europeans should push against any US attempts to weaken or even abolish those European rules.\n\u201cAs the European Union, we can also build on our own strength,\u201d Scholz said on Monday. \u201cAs a community of more than 400 million Europeans, we have economic weight.\u201d\nPostmedia is committed to maintaining a lively but civil forum for discussion.

They treat us very very badly, so they\u2019re going to be in for tariffs.\u201d\nScholz\u2019s plea on competitiveness echoes a letter by the European steel industry lobby where it requested a meeting with the head of the European Commission to discuss solutions to high raw material and energy prices, and cheap foreign steel imports flooding the market.\nThe chancellor also welcomed the Commission\u2019s move to start a \u201cstrategic dialogue\u201d with the European car industry to discuss, among other things, the suspension of EU fines for companies failing to meet climate protection targets and CO2 emission limits in their production fleets.\nFrance has previously demanded that the EU reduce sanctions on automakers not complying with pollution rules. Both Paris and Berlin are also pushing for the EU to lower requirements from corporations on reporting their environmental and governance metrics.\n\u201cWe\u2019re defending simplification on as European a scale as possible,\u201d Macron said, citing the sectors he deemed critical including automobiles, steel and chemicals.\n\u201cWe urgently need to use all European instruments to ensure that our companies, such as farmers, enjoy fair conditions of competition in an increasingly brutal environment,\u201d he said underscoring an uneven competitive environment for businesses.\nWhile both Scholz and Macron pledged to continue cooperating with the US, Scholz regretted \u201chow the extreme right is gaining ground everywhere in the western world, in western societies.\u201d\n\u201cThey want to drive us apart \u2013 and that is weakening Europe,\u201d Scholz said.\nThe meeting in Paris marked the anniversary of the 1963 Elysee Treaty signed between post-World War II leaders Konrad Adenauer and Charles de Gaulle.\nPostmedia is committed to maintaining a lively but civil forum for discussion.

            "summary": "German Chancellor Olaf Scholz has appealed to the EU for increased support for European industry, including subsidies and reduced regulations, a move criticized by conservative opponents as an attempt to adopt their policies ahead of the impending general election. In his letter to EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, Scholz requested delays on climate rules affecting businesses and waivers for car manufacturers on emission fines. His proposals, echoing center-right demands, come as Germany's economy faces stagnation, and polls show his party trailing behind the CDU and the far-right Alternative for Germany.",
            "content": "German Chancellor appeals to the EU executive to slash regulation and support industry with subsidies \u2014 only to be accused by his conservative opponents of stealing their policies.\nBRUSSELS \u2014 An increasingly desperate Olaf Scholz has issued an appeal to Brussels to support European industry, only to draw a rebuke from his conservative opponents that he is stealing from their policy agenda in a bid to stave off a general election defeat next month.\nIn a letter to European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen obtained by POLITICO, the German chancellor calls on the executive to offer more cash for businesses and to slash red tape that he says is holding back the bloc\u2019s industries.\nEchoing long-standing demands from Europe\u2019s center right, Scholz, a Social Democrat, wants a delay on climate disclosure rules affecting businesses; the waiving of fines for car manufacturers that fail to meet new emission targets; and subsidized electricity prices.\nScholz\u2019s asks are not new and repeat demands made by his center-left government last year. But by putting them into a formal letter to von der Leyen, a fellow German, Scholz is making a last-ditch effort to recast his reputation as a pro-business leader with a plan to save Germany\u2019s ailing economy and critical auto industry.\nHis critics aren\u2019t buying it.\nScholz \u201cseems to be slipping into schizophrenia toward the end of his term of office,\u201d said Hildegard Bentele, a European lawmaker from Germany\u2019s Christian Democratic Union, which is part of the center-right European People\u2019s Party group.\nHis suggestions are \u201calmost 100 percent EPP policy,\u201d Bentele argues, adding that she \u201cwonders where he was last year\u201d when von der Leyen was presenting her plans for her second term as Commission chief.\nWith less than two months to go before a snap election on Feb. 23 that he\u2019s expected to lose, Scholz is running out of time. Polls put his Social Democratic Party in third place with 17 percent, well below the CDU (30 percent) and just behind the far-right Alternative for Germany party.\nGerman businesses have criticized Scholz\u2019s government for unambitious reforms, uncompetitive energy costs and excessive bureaucracy at a time of stagnation in Europe\u2019s largest economy. The Bundesbank has slashed its growth forecast for 2025 to just 0.2 percent, with United States President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s threats to slap tariffs on all imports.\nGermany\u2019s export-based economy would suffer if it\u2019s caught between Trump\u2019s tariffs and Chinese industrial subsidies: The country\u2019s companies have high exports to both the U.S. and China.\nScholz claims the European Union\u2019s policies should enable those exports and not anger trading partners. One such example is a planned EU carbon border tax, the Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism.\nAccording to Scholz, the carbon tax needs to be reworked to boost the attractiveness of energy-intensive products, like steel, made in Europe. As it stands, the CBAM would only impose tariffs on incoming products, shielding European companies from cheaper products that don\u2019t meet the same standards.\nGerman automakers, meanwhile, are highly exposed to the Chinese market \u2014 making Berlin a staunch opponent of the Commission\u2019s duties on made-in-China electric vehicles following an anti-subsidy investigation pushed for by Paris. Scholz again decried the duties in his letter, calling for a negotiated solution.\nWhile France and Germany are at loggerheads over the made-in-China EV duties, Scholz highlighted the two\u2019s unlikely partnership to lobby for an end to the fines that automakers face this year should they fail to hit new emission targets.\nA coalition of EU countries is advocating for the waiver, including a proposal from Italy and the Czech Republic that calls for an earlier review of the overarching 2035 legislation requiring zero-emission vehicle sales.\nFrance and Germany opted out of cosigning the mandate over disagreements about the use of biofuels, but\u00a0conspired with Italy\u00a0ahead of the EU\u2019s Competitiveness Council meeting in November.\n\u201cWe didn\u2019t agree on everything, but we agreed that we have a problem,\u201d said a French government official with knowledge of the discussions who was granted anonymity because they were not permitted to comment on the matter. \u201cWe basically converged on the fact that we would act together on the Competitiveness Council to put forward the issue of the fines.\u201d\nSuch a move would be welcome news to major automakers like Volkswagen and Renault that have bemoaned the fines.\nBut it\u2019s unlikely to win Scholz their votes.\n\u201cGermany is at the top when it comes to tax and bureaucracy burdens. It is not enough to just talk about reducing bureaucracy,\u201d German car lobby VDA commented on the letter. \u201cAnd not only in Germany, but also in Brussels \u2014 this is where most of the new bureaucratic costs are now being incurred.\u201d\nAnother big request from Scholz is for a two-year delay on the EU\u2019s incoming corporate sustainability disclosure rules, which the shaky French government also supports. Or at least, the old one did.\nAdopted in 2023, the rules require businesses to report on climate risks their operations are exposed to, as well their own impact on the environment. So far, only the largest companies are expected to report this information.\nMinisters from Scholz\u2019s coalition had already requested a delay in their own letter to the Commission back in December. That was after former Finance Minister Christian Lindner had said Berlin should seek to abolish the law altogether, and former French Prime Minister Michele Barnier suggested a moratorium on the text.\nBut again here, the EPP had gotten there first. Now officially expected in the new mandate, a major simplification of the disclosure rules was a campaign promise made by von der Leyen to the EPP.\nScholz\u2019s political opponents were quick to point out the similarities, with Julia Kl\u00f6ckner, the CDU\u2019s economic policy spokesperson, calling the Scholz letter \u201ca helpless election campaign maneuver\u201d that \u201clacks credibility.\u201d\n\u201cThere is no justification for any reasonable Pole to continue purchasing Teslas,\u201d says minister S\u0142awomir Nitras.\nLobbyists want the Commission to beef up rules protecting the domestic auto industry, but that may not help the car sector.\nWestern carmakers quietly sulk that their Chinese competitors are getting a free ride.\nEuropean automakers may be forced to shift production from Mexico to the U.S., costing them time and money.",

The owner of X has been growing increasingly vocal in his support for Scholz's far-right rivals from the AfD party.\nTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video\nAddressing the ongoing economic downturn, Scholz pointed out that Germany still had the third-largest economy in the world behind the US and China, despite its population of only 84 million people.\nScholz noted that \"times are tough, that's something we all can sense.\"\n\"Our economy is facing challenges. The cost of living has gone up,\" he added, pointing to \"increasing anxiety about Russia's brutal war of aggression against Ukraine.\"\n\"Considering these worries, it is no wonder that many are asking themselves,\u00a0so where does Germany go from here? Again, my answer is: It is by standing together that we are strong.\"\nThe politician also pledged Germany would \"not leave Ukraine in the lurch\" and maintain its support\u00a0while also staying level-headed and making sure the war doesn't spread.\nThe German leader's speech made no reference to the ongoing war between Israel and Hamas in Gaza and other crisis points in the Middle East.\nThe chancellor pleaded with the public to vote in the upcoming election this February, saying the current situation in the world shows \"what a great accomplishment free and fair elections are.\n\"Our fate is in our own hands. We can make 2025 a good year,\" said Scholz.\nEdited by: Wesley Dockery",

Recent viewership statistics show Weidel's popularity overshadowing that of the current Chancellor Olaf Scholz. Weidel is set to be nominated as the AfD's top candidate for the upcoming parliamentary elections on February 23. The engagement with Musk is expected to draw significant attention to the party.",
            "content": "While the rightwing Alternative for Germany (AfD) party has been persecuted and harassed in a myriad of ways by both the MSM and the German establishment, it now has found a home in the social platform X \u2013 where the party is getting judged by the quality of their policy proposals, and NOT because Globalist narrative demands it be called \u2018far-right.\u2019\nThis is satisfying for us at TGP, one of the very first news vehicles to report fairly on the German political phenomenon (you can browse our hundreds of articles pieces about AfD here).\nAfter Elon Musk voiced support for the party caused massive waves in the country, things are going to get even more mind-blowing for the liberal Globalists, now that Musk and AfD\u2019s candidate for Chancellor Alice Weidel are to host a \u2018Spaces\u2019 podcast together.\nWeidel is expected to hold a live online conversation with tech billionaire Elon Musk on January 9.\nDPA reported:\n\u201cMusk, a close adviser to US President-elect Donald Trump and a major political donor, recently created controversy by wading into German politics with a full-throated endorsement of the AfD in an opinion piece in the Sunday edition of Die Welt newspaper.\u201d\nTo give an idea of how important that can be, let\u00b4s look at the viewership of the YouTube New Year messages for failed Chancellor Olaf Scholz and for Weidel.\nScholz got only 54k views, and was ratioed to death with 3586 dislikes over 1076 likes, while Weidel got over 10 times more \u2013 594k views \u2013 with a positive balance of 83k likes and only 1493 dislikes.\nNow, compare that with some of the more high-profile X Spaces that have been hosted on X: Musk with Ron de Santis was seen live by over 4,5 million people, while the historic Musk-Trump podcast generated as many as 1 BILLION impressions \u2013 according to X\u2019s AI bot Grok, it\u2019s unclear how many of those were actual views.\nAs we can see, by making a fuss about it, the German political establishment practically guarantees the success of the Musk-Weidel spaces, with the potential of many millions of viewers.\nTwo days after the podcast, on January 11th, Weidel will be officially nominated as the party\u2019s top candidate, ahead of parliamentary elections on February 23.\n\u201c[Musk], who owns electric carmaker Tesla and private space firm SpaceX among other firms, later responded to a pro-AfD influencer: \u2018Wait until Alice and I do an X-Spaces conversation.

The AfD aims to strengthen ties with both the U.S. and Russia, despite its history of anti-American sentiment. While the party's popularity is rising, mainstream leaders remain wary, and the AfD seeks to build support amid changing political dynamics in Germany and Austria.",
            "content": "The AfD is using Elon Musk\u2019s endorsement to reach out to Donald Trump \u2014 and to appear more acceptable at home ahead of a national election.\nThis article is also available in: French\nGermany\u2019s nationalist far right is increasingly looking to ideological allies abroad to give it the legitimacy it craves at home.\nThat was evident at a convention of the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) on Saturday when Alice Weidel, the party\u2019s chancellor candidate, thanked billionaire tech mogul Elon Musk for streaming the event on his X account, where it was viewed by millions around the world, giving the party a much bigger stage than it is accustomed to.\n\u201cI would like to thank Elon Musk, who is live streaming this party conference so that everyone can see what we are doing politics for,\u201d Weidel said during her speech to enthusiastic cheers. \u201cEveryone should see it.\u201d Switching to English, she added: \u201cFreedom of speech!\u201d\nThe AfD has been energized by Musk\u2019s endorsement ahead of a national election on Feb. 23. Not only is he promoting the party on his platform, but AfD leaders see Musk, a close adviser to United States President-elect Donald Trump, as a key link to the incoming U.S. administration.\nIn a display of their desire to forge closer ties, AfD delegates adopted a motion on Saturday to build closer relations between Germany and the U.S., and in particular with the future Trump administration. Marc Jongen, an AfD member of the European Parliament, described the motion as a \u201cthank you\u201d to Musk.\nThe AfD, a Russia-friendly party that ordinarily wants closer relations with the Kremlin, isn\u2019t known for housing a strong pro-America faction. Rather, many AfD politicians resent what they view as U.S. postwar domination of Germany. In a recent interview with the American Conservative bimonthly magazine, Weidel said Germans are a \u201cdefeated people\u201d and suggested Germany is a \u201cslave\u201d to the U.S.\nBut for AfD leaders, Trump could redefine America\u2019s role in the world and become a key ally.\nWeidel suggested as much during her convention speech, implying that an AfD-led government would be uniquely placed to pursue strong ties with both the Kremlin and the Trump administration, making Germany \u2014 in the still far-fetched scenario that the party governs after February\u2019s election \u2014 a bridge between Putin and Trump.\nThe AfD \u201cis the only party that has all channels of communication open to the East and the West,\u201d she said.\nThe Trump administration hasn\u2019t clearly thrown its support behind the AfD, but Musk\u2019s advocacy for the party has at least sparked some interest in high places.\nEarlier this month, Vice President-elect JD Vance reposted on X an English-language translation of Musk\u2019s\u00a0opinion piece\u00a0in Germany\u2019s\u00a0Welt am Sonntag\u00a0newspaper, in which he called the party the \u201clast spark of hope\u201d for the country.\n\u201cI\u2019m not endorsing a party in the German elections, as it\u2019s not my country and we hope to have good relations with all Germans,\u201d Vance wrote. \u201cBut this is an interesting piece.\u201d\nVance went on to defend the party, claiming the \u201cAmerican media slanders AfD as Nazi-lite.\u201d\nMany German mainstream leaders, including conservatives, have warned that the AfD peddles Nazi ideology; meanwhile, Germany\u2019s federal domestic intelligence agency has classified it as a suspected right-wing extremist organization. The party\u2019s leader in the eastern German state of Thuringia, Bj\u00f6rn H\u00f6cke, has been found guilty of using a banned slogan employed by Adolf Hitler\u2019s SA storm troopers; a German court once ruled H\u00f6cke could justifiably be called a fascist.\nA defense of the party from someone of Vance\u2019s stature serves to undermine warnings from German officials, potentially legitimizing the AfD among voters. It also raises questions about  future relations between the Trump administration and the next German government, which, according to current polls, is likely to be led by conservative chancellor candidate Friedrich Merz.\nMerz\u2019s conservatives, like other German parliamentary parties, have vowed not to govern with the AfD. But party leaders are playing the long game, hoping to build enough popularity over time that other parties find it impossible to exclude them.\nIt\u2019s still far from clear that Musk\u2019s endorsement of the AfD will help it in that regard, even as polls show the party has become more popular in recent weeks. The AfD is in second place behind Germany\u2019s conservatives in polls, with support of around 21 percent.\nThere are also other sources of foreign support much closer to home that could also benefit the AfD.\nOne of the biggest boosts for the party may come from Austria, where the successes of Herbert Kickl and his far-right Freedom Party (FP\u00d6) \u2014 who appear poised to take power in Vienna after coalition talks among mainstream parties collapsed earlier this month \u2014 have emboldened German far-right leaders, who see in Austria a roadmap for how they too might one day take power.\nAfD leaders view the FP\u00d6 as a \u201csister party,\u201d and feel that should their Austrian sibling take power, it could further destigmatize the AfD in the eyes of German voters.\n\u201cAustria is ahead of us in terms of development,\u201d H\u00f6cke, the AfD\u2019s Thuringia leader, wrote in a post on X.\nJust a year ago, things weren\u2019t looking so rosy for the AfD.\nLast January, outraged Germans took to the streets in huge numbers to protest against the radical right after an investigative report by Correctiv\u00a0revealed that AfD politicians had been present at a meeting of right-wing extremists, at which a \u201cmaster plan\u201d to deport migrants and \u201cunassimilated citizens\u201d en masse was discussed. The attendees euphemistically dubbed the plot \u201cremigration.\u201d\nThe sustained protest movement, which drew millions in cities across the country, appeared to damage the AfD \u2014\u00a0leading many Germans to question whether the demonstrators had put a halt to the party\u2019s rise. Even France\u2019s far-right leader Marine Le Pen moved to distance herself from the AfD, if only in a bid to depict her own party as more palatable for French voters.\nA year later, however, the AfD has largely recovered, and is approaching the record-high polling numbers it enjoyed before the protest movement. During that time, Trump was elected on a platform that included a promise to carry out mass deportations.\nIn an illustration of how extremist ideas can rapidly become normal with a little rhetorical resonance from the party\u2019s friends across the Atlantic, the AfD\u2019s national leaders, who used to avoid uttering the word \u201cremigration\u201d in light of the controversy, are now fully embracing the term.\nDuring her speech at the AfD convention, Weidel vowed to seal Germany\u2019s borders and enact \u201clarge-scale repatriations\u201d once in power.\n\u201cI have to tell you quite honestly: If it\u2019s to be called remigration, then it\u2019s just called remigration,\u201d Weidel declared to spirited applause.\nThe \u201cchameleon\u201d tech billionaire is one of the most powerful politically connected people in the world. Europe\u2019s governments are still working out how to deal with being on his bad side.\nDissolving of parliament sets the stage for what could be Germany\u2019s sharpest swerve to the right in decades.\nThe conservative leader\u2019s attacks signal the next government may be just as discordant as the one that recently fell.\nFriedrich Merz wants to make Germany great again, but his country is confronting global risks beyond the control of any domestic leader.",

In 2017, Moscow and Damascus signed a deal for a 49-year lease by the Russian military of the Tartus naval base and the Khmeimim airbase in the east of the country.\nLate in December, the head of HTS and the country\u2019s de facto leader Ahmed Hussein al-Sharaa, best known by his nom de guerre Abu Mohammad al-Julani, said Damascus had \u201cstrategic interests\u201d in maintaining good ties with Russia, describing it as the \u201csecond most powerful country in the world.\u201d\n\u201cWe don\u2019t want Russia to exit Syria in a way that would not be befitting for its long-standing relations with the nation,\u201d al-Julani said.\nRussia\u2019s UN envoy Vassily Nebenzia echoed this sentiment on Friday, stating that Syria\u2019s new de facto authorities have shown an interest in preserving ties with Moscow and its military presence in the region.\nDuring his end-of-year press conference in December, Russian President Vladimir Putin the issue of maintaining a Russian military presence in Syria requires \u201ccareful consideration.\u201d\u00a0\u201cWe must reflect on how our relations will evolve with the political forces currently in control and those that will govern this country in the future,\u201d Putin said.\nRT News App\n\u00a9 Autonomous Nonprofit Organization \u201cTV-Novosti\u201d, 2005\u20132025.

They were killed using methods that are unimaginable in a civilized world.\"\nBaerbock also met with representatives from Syria's civil society during her visit, according to Der Spiegel journalist Christoph Schult, who has been traveling with her.\nSpeaking to DW on Friday, Christoph Schult said that the representatives made it clear that while they \"welcome the new development,\" they \"also fear that the moderate approach that has been taken so far could probably change into a more extremist one, exclusive one targeting minorities, not including minorities.\"\nThe German top diplomat spoke to a Christian priest, Schult said, who told Baerbock that while he welcomes the developments, he acknowledged that under the Assad regime \"the Christians were more or less safe.\"\n\"They are not sure how that will develop under the new rulers,\" Schult said, citing the priest.\nFrench Foreign Minister Barrot also met with members of Syria's civil society, the French AFP news agency reported.\n\"A political solution must be reached with France's allies, the Kurds, so that they are fully integrated into this political process that is beginning today,\" Barrot was quoted as saying in the meeting.\nThe French top diplomat also called on Syria's new rulers to swiftly inspect and destroy chemical weapons stockpiles belonging to the former authorities.\nThe visit to Syria comes four weeks\u00a0after rebel groups in Syria, led by the Islamist Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS), swiftly gained control over the country, with former President Bashar Assad fleeing to Russia. HTS leader Ahmad al-Sharaa is now considered the head of Syria's transitional government.\nIn the days following Assad's ousting, Western governments had\u00a0been weighing up how best to engage with Syria's new leadership considering that HTS is under EU sanctions and also a designated terrorist group.\n\"We know where HTS comes from ideologically, what it has done in the past. But we also hear and see the desire for moderation and for understanding with other important actors,\" Baerbock said in a statement.\nAccording to the German Federal Statistical Office, around 973,000 Syrians were living in Germany at the end of 2023.

They, on behalf of the EU's foreign representative Kaja Kallas, plan to hold talks with representatives of the rebel-formed transitional government.\nDe facto leader Ahmed al-Sharaa heads the Islamist rebel group Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) and was previously known by his nom de guerre Abu Mohammed al-Joulani.\nBaerbock is flying to Damascus from Cyprus on Friday morning. Barrot had celebrated the New Year with Defence Minister S\u00e9bastien Lecornu and the French troops stationed with the UN observer mission UNIFIL in nearby Lebanon.\nBaerbock demands protection for women, minorities\n\"A new beginning can only happen if the new Syrian society grants a place in the political process to all Syrians, women and men, of every ethnic or religious group, and provides rights and protection,\" Baerbock demanded.\nShe added that these rights must be preserved and must \"not be undermined potentially by overly long deadlines until elections or moves towards the Islamisation of the judicial or education systems.\"\nAl-Sharaa recently stated that it could take around three years to present a new draft constitution, and another year until elections. The Arab country remains fragmented and sectarianly divided after more than a decade of civil war. Even after Assad's fall, hostile militias are fighting for power.\nBaerbock said they wanted to support Syria in a peaceful transition of power, the reconciliation of society, and reconstruction - in addition to the humanitarian aid that has been provided for the people in Syria over the past years.\n\"A new beginning can only happen if the past is addressed, justice is established, and retaliatory acts against population groups do not occur,\" Baerbock insisted. She added that extremism and radical groups should have no place.\nScepticism over the rebels' past\n\"We know where the HTS ideologically comes from, what they have done in the past,\" Baerbock stated. But she said there is also a desire for moderation and understanding with other key players. The initiation of talks with the Kurdish-dominated Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) is a significant sign in this direction, she noted.\nHTS emerged from the al-Nusra Front, an offshoot of the terrorist network al-Qaeda. Al-Sharaa had disassociated from al-Qaeda and the Islamic State, considered a terrorist organizations by many Western countries. However, there are still reports suggesting that the HTS leadership maintains contact with al-Qaeda.\nBaerbock: We will judge HTS by their actions\nGiven this, Baerbock stated, \"We will continue to judge the HTS by their actions. Despite all scepticism, we must not miss the opportunity now to support the people in Syria at this crucial crossroads.\"\nGermany is also working to ensure that the intra-Syrian process is not disrupted from outside, the foreign minister explained.\nThis, she noted, includes respect for sovereignty and territorial integrity by all neighbouring states. Though she did not mention Turkey and Israel by name, those countries have been accused of pursuing their own interests in Syria.\nAdditionally, it is time for Russia to leave its military bases in Syria, she said. Moscow has been one of al-Assad's most important allies for years.\nMore than 16 million Syrians rely on humanitarian aid\nSyria has been largely destroyed after nearly 14 years of civil war and is contaminated with landmines and other ordnance.\nThe country lacks labour and skilled workers, the economy is contracting, and the currency has lost more than 90% of its value since 2020. Public services have collapsed. More than 16 million people rely on humanitarian aid.\nNearly 1 million Syrians in Germany\nIn Baerbock's discussions in Damascus, the potential return of Syrian refugees from Germany, as supported by the transitional Syrian government, is likely to be a topic.\nAround 975,000 Syrians currently live in Germany, according to the German Interior Ministry. Most arrived in the country since 2015 as a result of the civil war.",

David Maddox reports\nJust a little over a week into his second term, President Donald Trump took steps to maximize his power, sparking chaos and what critics contend is a constitutional crisis as he challenges the separation of powers that have defined American government for more than 200 years.  The new administration's most provocative move came this week, as it announced it would temporarily halt federal payments to ensure they complied with Trump's orders barring diversity programs.  The technical-sounding directive had enormous immediate impact before it was blocked by a federal judge, potentially pulling trillions of dollars from police departments, domestic violence shelters, nutrition services and disaster relief programs that rely on federal grants.\nIsrael on Thursday suspended the planned release of Palestinian prisoners after Gaza militants freed three Israeli hostages and five Thais amid chaotic scenes.\"Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, along with Defence Minister Israel Katz, has instructed the delay of the release of the terrorists scheduled for today until the safe departure of our hostages in the upcoming phases is assured,\" Netanyahu's office said.Israel had been due to free 110 prisoners, including 30 minors, in exchange for the three Israelis, the Palestinian Prisoners' Club advocacy group said earlier.A Hamas source told AFP the group was in touch with mediators to \"compel\" Israel to release the 110 prisoners in the third exchange under the January 19 ceasefire deal aimed at ending the war in Gaza.Israel later said it had received assurance from mediators over the future \"safe release\" of captives.Another hostage and prisoner release had been scheduled for Saturday, with three Israeli men due to be set free.The prisoner release setback came after militants in Gaza freed three Israeli hostages and five Thais captured in Hamas's October 7, 2023 attack on Israel.Netanyahu denounced what he called \"shocking scenes\" during the hostage releases in Khan Yunis.Television images showed gunmen struggling to control hundreds of Gazans there to witness the handover.\"This is yet another proof of the unimaginable cruelty of the Hamas terrorist organisation,\" Netanyahu said.First to be freed Thursday was Israeli woman soldier Agam Berger, 20, handed over separately to International Committee of the Red Cross officials in Jabalia in northern Gaza.Before she was freed, footage showed her on a stage with masked Hamas members in distinctive green headbands, being prompted to wave to onlookers.Israel's military said the three Israeli hostages and five Thais were now back in Israel.The two other freed Israelis are civilians Gadi Moses, 80, and Arbel Yehud, 29, both of whom also hold German nationality.Netanyahu's office named the freed Thais as Watchara Sriaoun, Pongsak Tanna, Sathian Suwannakham, Surasak Lamnau and Bannawat Saethao.Thailand's Prime Minister Paetongtarn Shinawatra said she was \"elated\" that they were out of captivity.In devastated Khan Yunis, dense crowds gathered to catch a glimpse of Yehud and Moses ahead of their release near the childhood home of Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar, who Israel killed in October.&nbsp;On Wednesday, the Moses family said it had \"received with great excitement the wonderful news of our beloved Gadi's return\".The January 19 ceasefire hinges on the release of Israeli hostages taken during Hamas's October 7, 2023 attack, in exchange for around 1,900 people -- mostly Palestinians -- in Israeli custody.Before Thursday, Hamas had released seven hostages, with 290 prisoners freed in exchange.&nbsp;The halt to the prisoner releases led to disappointment for around 300 Palestinians waiting for relatives in Ramallah, in the occupied West Bank.\"I am so tired. This isn't fair. See for yourself all the families that came to wait and now are uncertain when we will see them,\" said Raghed Nasser, 21, whose father Hussein was jailed 22 years ago while her mother was pregnant with her.- Aid trucks row -The truce deal has allowed a surge of aid into the devastated Gaza Strip, where the war has created a long-running humanitarian crisis.However, senior Hamas officials accused Israel of slowing aid deliveries, with one citing key items such as fuel, tents, heavy machinery and other equipment.COGAT, the Israeli defence ministry body that oversees civilian affairs in the Palestinian territories, called this \"totally fake news\".As the text of the agreement -- mediated by Qatar, Egypt and the United States -- has not been made public, AFP was not able to verify its terms on aid.- Displacement 'injustice' -The ceasefire deal is currently in its first, 42-day phase, which should see 33 hostages freed. The Thai hostages are not included in that number.US President Donald Trump has repeatedly claimed credit for sealing the agreement, which took effect before his inauguration, and his Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff, who took part in the talks, met Netanyahu in Israel on Wednesday.Trump has invited Netanyahu to the White House on February 4, according to the premier's office.After the truce began, Trump touted a plan to \"clean out\" Gaza, calling for Palestinians to relocate to neighbouring countries such as Egypt or Jordan.However, both Egyptian President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi and Jordan's King Abdullah II rejected this.More than 376,000 displaced Palestinians have gone back to northern Gaza since Israel reopened access earlier this week, according to the UN humanitarian office OCHA, with many returning to little more than rubble.\"My house is destroyed,\" 33-year-old Mohammed Al-Faleh told AFP.\"The biggest problem is that there is no water,\" he added. \"Food aid is reaching Gaza... but there is no gas or electricity. We bake bread on a fire fuelled by wood and nylon.\"Israel cut ties with the UN agency for Palestinian refugees (UNRWA) from Thursday following accusations it provided cover for Hamas, a move likely to hamper delivery of vital services after 15 months of war in Gaza.UNRWA, which has long been the lead agency in coordinating aid to Gaza, will be banned from operating on Israeli soil, and contact between it and Israeli officials will also be forbidden.UN chief Antonio Guterres had demanded Israel retract its order.&nbsp;bur-srm/it\nJessica Tarlov knocked Jesse Watters over his sarcastic remark on federal workers that have been offered buyouts by the president's administration.\nU.S. President Donald Trump has refused to pay 290,000 pounds ($360,000) in legal fees after his English lawsuit against a private investigations firm was dismissed, a London court heard on Wednesday.

The situation underscores the challenges of engaging with the new regime, which is closely related to the militant group Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS).

German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock joined him later, a ministry source told AFP, for talks on behalf of the European Union.\nSharaa, head of the Islamist group Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS), led the offensive that toppled Syria\u2019s longtime ruler Bashar al-Assad in early December.\nThe HTS-dominated interim authorities now face the daunting task of rebuilding state institutions, with growing calls to ensure an inclusive transition and guarantee minority rights.\nBarrot, in a post in X, said: \u201cTogether, France and Germany stand alongside the Syrian people, in all their diversity.\u201d\nHe added that the two European powers wanted to promote a \u201cpeaceful transition\u201d.\nIn Damascus, he expressed hope for a \u201csovereign, stable and peaceful\u201d Syria.\nIt was also a \u201chope that the aspirations of all Syrians can be realised\u201d, he added, \u201cbut it is a fragile hope\u201d.\nIn a statement, Baerbock said Germany wanted to help Syria become a \u201csafe home\u201d for all its people, and a \u201cfunctioning state, with full control over its territory\u201d.\nShe said the visit was a \u201cclear signal\u201d to Damascus of the possibility for a new relationship between Syria and Germany, and Europe more broadly.\nDespite \u201cscepticism\u201d about HTS \u2014 which is rooted in the Syrian branch of Al-Qaeda and is designated a terrorist organisation by numerous governments \u2014 Baerbock said that \u201cwe must not miss the opportunity to support the Syrian people at this important crossroads\u201d.\nShe also asked the new regime to avoid \u201cacts of vengeance against groups within the population\u201d, to avoid a long delay before elections, and to avert attempts to Islamise the judicial and education systems.\n\u201cThis must be our common objective,\u201d she added.\n\u2013 Prison visit \u2013\nThe two ministers also plan to visit the notorious Saydnaya prison, not far from the capital.\nSaydnaya was the site of extrajudicial executions, torture and forced disappearances, and epitomised the atrocities committed against Assad\u2019s opponents.\nSince his ouster, a bevy of foreign envoys have travelled to Damascus to meet with the country\u2019s new leaders.\nFrance and Germany had both already sent lower-level delegations last month.\nAt the start of his visit, Barrot met with representatives of Syria\u2019s Christian communities.\nDiplomatic sources said Barrot told the Christian leaders that France was committed to a pluralistic Syria with equal rights for all, including minority groups.\nSyria\u2019s civil war \u2014 which started in 2011, sparked by the Assad government\u2019s brutal repression of democracy protests \u2014 saw Germany, France and a host of other countries shutter their diplomatic missions in Damascus.\nThe conflict killed more than 500,000 people, displaced millions and left Syria fragmented and ravaged.\nThe new authorities have called for the lifting of sanctions imposed on Syria under Assad to allow for reconstruction.\nParis is due to host an international summit on Syria later this month, following a similar meeting in December in Jordan.\nWith 2,400 staff representing 100 different nationalities, AFP covers the world as a leading global news agency.

Discussions are now emerging about withdrawing from energy agreements, further destabilizing Europe\u00e2\u0080\u0099s energy landscape.\n Germany\u00e2\u0080\u0099s energy missteps serve as a stark reminder of the need for balanced, pragmatic energy policies.

It questions whether Western countries will leverage this to reduce dependence on autocratic regimes. The piece critiques Europe and the UK for their rapid transition to renewable energy, which has led to industrial decline and high energy prices. It highlights Germany's vulnerability due to energy policies and emphasizes the need for a diverse energy strategy, suggesting that fossil fuels will remain essential in the near future.",
            "content": "Teddy Roosevelt believed in speaking softly and carrying a big stick. Donald Trump will never speak softly, or even politely, but he will soon pack the power inherent in presiding over the world\u2019s number one producer of oil and gas.\nFifty years ago, the US was the world\u2019s largest importer of oil, as demonstrated by the pain suffered during the Arab oil embargo. Now, largely due to fracking, any such future threat is moot while Texas\u2019s Permian basin, in effect the world\u2019s fifth largest oil producer, is expected soon to be responsible for half of all US oil output.\nThe question now is whether other western countries will embrace this development as a way to break dependence on autocratic regimes like Russia, Iran, Qatar and Saudi Arabia. Particularly promising is natural gas, which provides reliable energy that produces an estimated 40 per cent less carbon dioxide (CO2) than coal and 30 per cent less than oil.\nA shift to natural gas, as an intermediate step in reducing emissions, makes sense \u2013 that is until politics and climate theology come into the picture. In Europe and in the UK, politicians insist that we will soon be able to get along just fine without evil fossil fuels.\nIn Britain, such efforts have succeeded in securing a two thirds drop in UK energy production, while demand has fallen only by a third; once a net energy exporter, the UK increasingly depends on imports, even while an estimated 25 billion barrels of oil remain untapped. Studies have shown that oil imported into the UK produces more carbon emissions per delivered barrel than oil produced in the UK.\nNow with the highest electricity prices in Europe, and with particularly punishing rates for industry, manufacturing has cratered. Since 1990, the manufacturing share of GDP in Britain has dropped by roughly 50 per cent.\nBut this misery is not confined to Britain. In the EU, nearly a million industrial jobs have been lost over the past few years. Many will have gone to China and some developing countries.\nThe primary case study is Germany, a fading industrial power amid high energy prices. The country\u2019s economy is now utterly vulnerable to changes in the weather. Imagine this: Germany\u2019s companies are forced to endure ruinous price increases at times of dunkelflaute \u2013 a combination of cold weather, cloud cover and light wind.\nYet even as energy supplies are constrained, the EU and the UK are insisting on a rapid transition to electric vehicles. If kept in place, this will cause Germany\u2019s entire industrial structure to decline, resulting in the potential loss of upwards of 400,000 of its estimated 800,000 auto jobs by 2030.\nThe only clear winner in this ideology-driven kabuki show is China, which seeks dominion over EVs and other renewable technologies even while it is accused of emitting more greenhouse gases than the entire developed world put together. Now apparently on a coal plant building spree, China\u2019s state-directed economy cynically uses cheap, reliable fossil fuels, and control of critical minerals, to dominate both EVs and the solar-panel industry. Meanwhile, western \u201cgreen companies\u201d, like Swedish battery maker Northvolt, file for bankruptcy while others suffer massive losses, particularly EV startups.\nEven if you accept that China\u2019s dominance is worth the price of \u201csaving the planet\u201d, current energy policies will not create an electrical grid to power it. As demand for EVs and reliance on renewables grow, we could see brownouts even in energy rich Canada and the US in the coming years. The North American Electric Reliability Corporation has found that a deep cold snap would cause outages in swathes of the country.\nAcross the pond, Europe and the UK are already struggling to build enough capacity to support their relatively small number of electrical vehicles. In Britain, in 2021, the House of Commons Public Accounts Committee admitted that there was a \u201cmountain to climb\u201d to meet transition targets, and doubted that the UK government had \u201csufficiently thought through\u201d its EV roll-out plans.\nThe shift to artificial intelligence is likely to intensify this crisis. Microsoft is reported to be opening a new data centre globally every three days. These often loud, intrusive and power-hungry operations could grow from 4.5 per cent of energy demand to 10 per cent by 2035. Firms like Google, a long-time ally of the UN in promoting draconian climate orthodoxy, now admit they are spewing out far more greenhouse gases \u2013 about 50 per cent more than in 2019. Microsoft and Google are already estimated to consume as much energy as whole countries, including Ghana, Iceland and Tunisia.\nThe needs of the tech oligarchs could prove a final push towards energy realism. There has been a growing movement among tech giants like Amazon and Microsoft to encourage the development of nuclear power, although sometimes stymied by the objections of Biden officials. Microsoft even pushed to reopen the shuttered Three Mile Island plant in Pennsylvania.\nWhatever the political class decides, reality suggests that the dominance of fossil fuels, even coal, will persist for the foreseeable future. Trump\u2019s \u201cdrill baby drill\u201d policies could further entrench this pattern, and offer, in the short-term, a solution to the West\u2019s energy shortfalls. For Europe, reversing President Biden\u2019s ill-considered attempt to stymie the growth of LNG exports, as is now likely, should be seen as manna from heaven.\nEnergy realism, open to a diverse and changeable mix of sources, is imperative if the United States is to avoid the fate of the last industrial vestiges of Britain and the rest of the green West. If we continue to place all our bets on the sun and wind, we could soon be enjoying living standards consistent not with an abundant future, but more akin to those of the Middle Ages.\nThis piece first appeared at The Telegraph.\n\nJoel Kotkin is the author of The Coming of Neo-Feudalism: A Warning to the Global Middle Class.

The worst-ranked countries are major oil producers like Iran and Russia. Despite progress in renewables, the EU and Germany received medium ratings due to insufficient climate policies. China is experiencing a renewables boom, but its reliance on coal remains a concern for future emissions reductions.",
            "content": "The world is at a turning point, as CO2 emissions could soon stop rising thanks to a renewable energy boom. But according to a new climate protection ranking, countries aren't doing enough to move away from oil and gas.\nRenewable energies are expanding rapidly in high-emissions countries, but too many states are prolonging the use of fossil fuels, particularly gas, according to the latest Climate Change Performance Index, which ranks states' climate protection measures.\n\"The world is at a turning point. Peak of global emissions is closely in sight,\" said Niklas H\u00f6hne of German climate policy think tank NewClimate Institute,\u00a0and a co-author of the report. But states\u00a0need\u00a0to act quickly to drastically cut emissions and \"prevent further dangerous consequences of climate change,\" he added.\nThe CCPI, published annually, evaluated the 63 countries plus the European Union that are responsible for 90% of global greenhouse gas emissions.\nOf the countries analyzed, 61 have managed to increase the share of green energy sources, like wind and solar, in their energy mixes over the last five years.\n\"Renewables are in the fast lane, especially in the electricity sector,\" said lead author Jan Burck from environment NGO Germanwatch, on the launch of the CCPI during the UN climate summit in Azerbaijan. \"In addition, there is an increasing electrification of the mobility, residential and industrial sectors. The trend toward\u00a0electrification is continuing.\"\nStill, 42 countries' current per capita emissions are not aligned with the Paris goal of limiting global average temperature rise to 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 Fahrenheit).\nThe CCPI, said H\u00f6hne, shows \"how big the resistance from the fossil fuel lobby is.\"\nIn the US presidential election, this was \"a decisive factor in bringing [Donald] Trump back to the White House,\" said H\u00f6hne. The US has experienced a boom in shale gas over the past few years and Trump has promised to further expand domestic fossil fuel production and spend less on clean energy.\nThe countries that ranked worst in the CCPI \u2014 Iran, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and Russia \u2014 are also among the largest oil and gas producers in the world. The share of renewables in their respective energy mixes is under 3%, the analysis found, with the countries showing \"no signs of departing from fossil fuels as a business model.\"\nThe CCPI, put together by experts from Germanwatch, NewClimate Institute and international environment grouping Climate Action Network, ranks countries' progress in cutting carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions and energy use\u00a0as well as expanding renewables and improving climate policy.\nThe top three spots in the ranking remained unclaimed \u2014 as is usually the case \u2014 because none of the countries surveyed are doing enough to \"avoid dangerous climate change\" and achieve a \"very high\" rating.\nDenmark once again clinched the number 4 spot, followed by the Netherlands and the United Kingdom, one of the countries with the biggest ranking improvement this year.\nThe UK moved up 14 positions from 2023 due the recent closure of the country's last coal power plant. The new Labour government has also\u00a0pledged not to issue any new licenses for fossil fuel projects, making\u00a0the country a pioneer among industrialized G7 nations.\nThe CCPI also gave Norway, Sweden, Luxembourg, Estonia and Portugal a \"high\" rating, alongside the Philippines, Morocco, Chile and the world's most populous country, India.\nThe European Union slipped one spot down the ranking to 17th place and scored\u00a0a \"medium\" rating for its overall climate performance.\nWhile the authors described the bloc's climate protection\u00a0\u2014\u00a0based on\u00a0the EU Green Deal\u2014 as major progress, they said measures it had taken so far didn't amount to a fair share of\u00a0global greenhouse gas emissions cuts. The authors called on the bloc to stop financing fossil fuels and fulfill pledges to phase out oil and gas subsidies by 2025.\nGermany, the EU's largest economy, also slipped two places to 16th and was given a \"medium\" rating. \"Although considerable progress has been made in renewables, the political inaction in the transport and building sectors still leads to high emissions,\" said co-author Thea Uhlich from Germanwatch.\nBoth sectors have consistently missed their emissions reductions targets, and German environmental NGO BUND has said it is taking legal action over the country's main climate legislation, calling it insufficient.\nThe authors gave nine other EU countries, as well as Egypt, Nigeria, Brazil, Colombia, Vietnam, Thailand and Pakistan, a \"medium\" rating.\nChina and the US are the\u00a0world's biggest polluters of greenhouse gas CO2 and were rated \"very low\" for climate performance.\nIn the US, the landmark Inflation Reduction Act, a climate bill signed by outgoing President Joe Biden, has been positive for expanding renewables, said the authors. But \"per capita emissions are still very high at 15.8 tons of CO2 equivalent per year,\" added\u00a0H\u00f6hne.\nSome fear a Trump presidency will set back climate action, and while Trump's election is \"certainly not good news\" for the climate, said H\u00f6hne, \"it remains to be seen\" how much legislation\u00a0the new administration can roll back.\n\"Even Trump can't stop the boom in renewable energy,\" he said.\nTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video\nAs for China, the nation is experiencing an \"unprecedented\" renewables boom, pointed out Burck from Germanwatch.\n\"Emissions appear to have almost peaked. That would be a real milestone and an important driver worldwide,\" he said. In the first quarter of 2024, CO2 emissions fell in China without an accompanying economic downturn. This is significant as emissions otherwise usually fall when a country is in recession.\n\"But to reduce the country's immense emissions quickly and sustainably, we now need a clear move away from fossil fuels,\" Burck said.\nThere is currently no indication the country is moving in that direction;\u00a0China is still building a lot of coal plants. But things could change with the\u00a0pending new five-year plan.\n\"This is a huge opportunity for China to gain international recognition \u2014 especially in contrast to the future US government,\" he said.\nThis article was originally written in German.",

            "summary": "Germany faces the highest electricity prices in Europe, burdening consumers and the economy. While renewable sources provided 125% of demand at times, winter months revealed a reliance on coal and gas. In 2024, imports from France, which relies on nuclear power, were significant. The Federal Cartel Office is investigating potential price manipulation by energy companies. Industrial electricity costs remain high, prompting political calls, especially from the CDU/CSU, to reduce grid fees and taxes. The transition to renewable energy is costly, necessitating extensive infrastructure investments before financial benefits materialize.",
            "content": "Electricity is more expensive in Germany than anywhere else in Europe. This burdens consumers, especially the sluggish economy. Politicians are looking for solutions. What options do they have?\nThe new year was ushered in with stormy weather. Wind turbines were operating at top speed and in many places, the sun was shining. As a result, electricity production from renewable energies in Germany accounted for 125% of demand, according to the Fraunhofer Institute for Solar Energy Systems.\nThe oversupply drove down the price of electricity on the exchanges, where prices are determined by supply and demand, and for a few hours, electricity was even available for free.\nIn 2024, an average of 59% of Germany's electricity was generated from renewable sources. But during the winter darkness, this output is far from adequate. December 12, 2024, marked a low point, when only 18% of Germany's electricity needs were met by renewables. The rest had to be generated by coal- and gas-fired power plants, and electricity imports from neighboring EU countries.\nTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video\nThe EU has a common electricity market. This means that during periods of high wind and sunshine, Germany is able to export energy, while during periods of low wind and sunshine, it increasingly has to import energy. Most of the electricity that Germany purchased in 2024 came from France, which meets 70% of its energy needs with nuclear power that is available throughout the year.\nImports and exports are based on the current prices on the European Energy Exchange. In addition, consumers have to pay the national taxes and levies. In Germany, around 30% of the electricity price is made up of grid charges. This refers to the cost of expanding the power grid. Taxes and levies make up about another third.\nHouseholds and companies have barely even noticed the price fluctuations because they often have long-term electricity contracts. They pay their electricity supplier a fixed price for a specified period of time, as agreed in a contract.\nHowever, since the beginning of 2025, suppliers have also had to offer dynamic rates at current prices. In this way, customers who use large amounts of electricity, for example, to charge electric cars or run heat pumps, have had a financial incentive to schedule their energy consumption for times supply is high and thus prices are low.\nTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video\nIn 2024, electricity generation from brown coal continued to decline by a good 8% in Germany, while black coal declined by more than 27%. Since 2015, the percentage of electricity generated from coal has fallen by almost half, significantly reducing CO2 emissions.\n2024 was also the first year that Germany was able to do without producing any of its own nuclear power. The last three nuclear power plants, which were shut down in 2023, accounted for a solid 6% of electricity production.\nBut is too little wind and sun power to blame for the jump in prices? Or have energy companies perhaps been deliberately trying to drive up the price of electricity by not connecting all their coal- and gas-fired power plants to the grid in order to reduce supply? This is the question now being asked by the German Federal Cartel Office. It is part of the Federal Ministry of Economics and is responsible for ensuring fair competition in the market. If it uncovers illegal price fixing, it can impose fines.\nNowhere in Europe is electricity more expensive than in Germany. According to the Federal Statistical Office, a family of three to four had to pay just under 40 cents per kilowatt hour in 2024. In Hungary and Bulgaria, on the other hand, where electricity is subsidized by the state, consumers only had to pay 10 cents per kilowatt hour.\nGermany also has subsidies, but only for industrial companies. However, energy-intensive companies have been complaining that energy costs are still far too high for them to be competitive.\nTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video\nWhile the industry was still paying around 12 cents per kilowatt hour in 2021, the price peaked at more than 50 cents in 2022 following Russia's invasion of Ukraine. On July 1, 2022, taxes and levies were significantly reduced for companies.\nToday, industrial businesses pay\u00a0around 17 cents. However, this is significantly higher than what companies pay in other major competitor countries. In 2023, for example, companies in the German automotive industry paid over twice as much for electricity as their competitors in China and almost three times as much as comparable companies in the US. Significantly reducing electricity prices remains one of the most pressing economic imperatives.\nThe center-right bloc of Christian Democratic Union (CDU) and\u00a0Christian Social Union (CSU), with Friedrich Merz at the head of their ticket for chancellor, have stated in their election platform that they want to halve grid fees and further reduce the electricity tax for energy-intensive companies. However, it is unclear how this is to be financed.\nWhat remains clear is that the continued expansion of renewable energies, electricity grids, and storage facilities will remain costly for many years to come. Only once the infrastructure is in place will the financial benefits of wind and solar energy be felt.\nThis article was originally written in German.\nWhile you're here: Every Tuesday, DW editors round up what is happening in German politics and society.

The book reflects on her life, political career, and key events, including her interactions with Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin. Despite criticisms of her foreign policy, she remains popular in Germany, and the book's launch has generated significant interest. Merkel plans to promote the book in Europe and the U.S. alongside Barack Obama. Speculations about her earnings from the memoir range from 10 to 12 million euros.",
            "content": "Former German Chancellor Angela Merkel's book 'Freedom' caused a stir ahead of its official publication on November 26. There's also the question of what role it might play in Germany\u2019s upcoming snap elections.\nAngela Merkel's book was launched with fanfare in the West but\u00a0also in\u00a0China. Tickets for Tuesday evening's\u00a0initial presentation of the former German chancellor's 736-page opus\u00a0at the Deutsches Theater in Berlin sold out online within minutes of going on sale a few weeks ago.\nMerkel's \"Freedom: Memoirs 1954-2021\" looks back on her life from her childhood and youth in former East Germany, German reunification, and her political rise through the end of her 16-year chancellorship in 2021. The book is being simultaneously published as an audiobook and in translation in several languages, including French and English. After that, the 70-year-old former leader is expected to embark on a tour of major European cities to promote the work.\nTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video\nIn excerpts released ahead of publication and several high-profile newspaper interviews, Merkel reveals her thoughts on current events. For example, she details her experience with\u00a0Donald Trump during his first term as US president, the difficulties of being the first female candidate for chancellor, and her decision to welcome almost large numbers of displaced people in 2015. She also explains her relationship with Russian President Vladimir Putin and her policies on Ukraine \u2014 which are now viewed somewhat skeptically by critics in Berlin.\nHer memoir is unexpectedly coinciding with Germany's federal election campaign following the collapse of the coalition government under her successor as chancellor,\u00a0Olaf Scholz. According to Ralph Bollmann, a journalist and author of a Merkel biography, the election is likely to cast a long shadow over the reception of her book.\nSo, too, will other unexpected political developments internationally, such as Trump's reelection, Bollmann told DW. \"Back then,\" he said, referring to Trump's first term, \"she was downright celebrated in the US as his liberal-democratic opponent. This will certainly help her with marketing now.\"\nMerkel will be in Washington on December 2, when she is set to present her book in the United States alongside her friend and former US President Barack Obama.\nWithin Germany, Bollmann sees it as a \"miscalculation\" on the part of the Berlin establishment to think that Merkel is no longer popular in Germany because of what critics have called her conciliatory approach to Moscow. She still has \"many fans in the country\" and the book will sell well, Bollmann said.\nWhat will be more problematic than her foreign policy decisions, he said, will be her \"unwillingness to reform her domestic policy.\" For example, her reluctance to push ahead with difficult issues such as reforming the military or taking powerful climate change action.\n\"Everyone will simply quote what suits their agenda,\" Bollmann said. What is striking, however, as Germany faces an election, is how all the major candidates for chancellor are trying to appeal to Merkel voters in their own way.\nThe main draw of the book will be to glean Merkel's view of key people and events, political scientist and journalist Andreas P\u00fcttmann told DW. Never, he said, has \"so much broad criticism, retrospective known-it-all attitudes, and hatred been heaped on a top politician as much as Angela Merkel. This is precisely why it is so important for her to \"present things from her perspective to a broader public.\"\nTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video\nAs usual with such projects, it remains unclear how much money the former chancellor is going to make from selling her story. Several German media outlets, without citing sources, have cited sums from 10 million to 12\u00a0million euros. No one from Merkel's team has commented on these conjectures.\nThe closest Merkel got to responding to these rumors was when she was referred to in an interview by Der Spiegel magazine as a soon-to-be \"multimillionaire\" and compared to Obama, who has capitalized on his former job to great success. She said that, like Obama, she hopes to establish a foundation.\n\"I won't be able to set up anything as big as Obama. But let's see,\" she said.\nThe choice of venue for her book launch is considered significant, as the Deutsches Theater is just a few minutes walk away from where Merkel resided in a divided Berlin. She and her husband, Joachim Sauer, are regular guests at the theater, considered one of the most sophisticated theaters in the city. A\u00a0passage from her book quoted in Die Zeit magazine reads that she went to the theater once a year with her parents, including the Deutsches Theater. She writes of how these visits \"always remain in her memory.\"\nThis article was originally written in German.\nWhile you're here: Every Tuesday, DW editors round up what is happening in German politics and society.

            "content": "Germany's ex-Chancellor Angela Merkel backed her record on refugees, Russia and the economy as she presented her new memoir in Berlin. Critics have said that the 700-page tome is light on new insights.\nAngela Merkel, the longest-serving chancellor of a unified postwar Germany, was back in the spotlight on Tuesday evening. The\u00a0Deutsches Theater in Berlin was the first port of call on Merkel's multi-continent tour to promote her autobiography\u00a0Freedom. Memories 1954-2021.\nOn stage, Merkel was given\u00a0the opportunity to defend her more controversial decisions. When pushed by journalist Anne Will to respond to critique that she was soft on Russia in exchange for cheap natural gas, that she did too little to address climate change or\u00a0to fund the Bundeswehr, she pushed back by saying that many of those things were not solely in her control.\nShe also rejected accusations that she \"skimped Germany into destruction\" with her Christian Democratic (CDU) party's focus on saving money over spending it on, for example, aging infrastructure like the beleaguered\u00a0national rail service Deutsche Bahn.\nWill also questioned Merkel\u00a0about her 2015 decision to eschew certain European Union statutes that require refugees to be processed in the first EU country in which they arrive, instead welcoming asylum seekers from countries like Syria, Iraq, and Afghanistan unequivocally.\n\"The alternative was to turn people away,\" perhaps violently, from the German border, \"which for me, was so much worse,\" Merkel said.\nTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video\nAs in her book, the former chancellor largely evaded the question of being too conciliatory towards Russia, particularly after the annexation of Crimea in 2014, in order to procure cheap fuel for Germany.\nShe writes however\u00a0that by accepting Ukraine's bid to join NATO, the West was sending a strong signal\u00a0to the Kremlin.\nRussian President Vladimir Putin, however, features perhaps more prominently than any other leader in the book. She recalls him as someone who was \"always ready to disrespect others,\" particularly by showing up late.\n\"Probably his greatest joy\u00a0was that the American president had to wait for him,\" she writes of Putin's behavior towards Barack Obama, who garners nearly as much attention in her memoir as the Russian president.\nShe describes\u00a0the former US president glowingly, saying she knew right away \"he was someone I could work well with.\" She also appears to accept without question his assertion that he had no personal knowledge that the National Security Agency (NSA) was spying on her personal mobile phone when that information came to light in 2015.\nIn one of the rare unknown insights the book offers, she reveals that Obama was one of the confidantes she sought advice from when deciding whether to run for a fourth term in 2017.\nTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video\nAs for US President-elect Donald Trump, she found him to be one person in front of cameras and another entirely when they were alone. In public, he refused to shake her hand and \"claimed that I had ruined Germany by taking in so many refugees in 2015 and 2016, accused us of spending too little on defense and criticized us for unfair trade practices.\"\nMerkel says that he acted \"as if Germany owed him and America something,\" but was uninterested in finding common ground or working on solutions.\nBehind closed doors, however, he had greeted her appropriately and\u00a0appeared to \"want to like whoever he was talking to.\"\nAnalysts have pointed out that despite its 740-page heft, the book offers little in the way of self-reflection or indeed, little\u00a0information at all that isn't already well known.\nThe book\u00a0is also noticeably light on several topics, such as religion. Despite being the daughter of a pastor, Merkel doesn't speak much about Christian faith. There are a few scattered mentions of Islam, almost exclusively in connection with extremism and terrorism. Also hardly mentioned at length are non-Western world leaders, such as Narendra Modi or Xi Jinping and his predecessor Hu Jintao.\nAt the book launch, she\u00a0did not take questions from the audience. She admitted towards the end, however, that she \"did not leave the country in perfect\u00a0condition,\" in terms of climate protection and digitalization.\nNext, the former chancellor will head to other major European cities to promote her work and then to Washington, where Obama is expected to be on hand to support her.\nAdditional reporting by Christoph Strack",

            "content": "Excerpts from former German Chancellor Angela Merkel's soon-to-be-published autobiography cover everything from growing up in a dictatorship to the conflict in Ukraine. A look at the key quotes.\nAngela Merkel was the longest-serving chancellor of a post-war, united Germany, earning a reputation for calm and pragmatic leadership. On Thursday,\u00a0Die Zeit\u00a0published passages from her highly anticipated book\u00a0Freedom. Memories 1954-2021.\nHere are some of the key takeaways.\nBorn in Hamburg in what was then West Germany in 1954, her father's work took the family to Brandenburg in the former East Germany when she was a baby.\nIn her book, she describes childhood under the East German (GDR) dictatorship as \"a life constantly on the edge. No matter how carefree a day began, everything could change in a matter of seconds\" if someone around her stepped out of line.\n\"The state knew no mercy,\" she writes, adding that realizing what lines could not be crossed was an important skill, even for a child. \"My pragmatic approach helped me\" in that regard, she says.\nThe ex-chancellor writes that despite the GDR's attempts to totally control its citizens, she maintained her carefree attitude and would come to disdain the \"pettiness, narrow-mindedness, tasteless and...humorlessness\" of the East German regime.\nIn Germany's 2005 federal election, Merkel was selected to represent the center-right CDU/CSU bloc over, among others, current CDU leader Friedrich Merz.\nShe says\u00a0she found \"a difference between theory and practice\" in the acceptance of a female candidate for head of government. \"There were doubts about this\" she writes, even \"deep within the ranks of women\" in her party.\nMerkel then explains\u00a0the challenge of going up against then-Chancellor Gerhard Schr\u00f6der and his reputation for being \"energetic and smart.\"\n\"Any man who challenged the chancellor...would have felt the same way. But being a woman, I felt, was definitely not an advantage.\"\nTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video\nIn an excerpt on meeting Russian President Vladimir\u00a0Putin at the 2007 Munich Security Conference, Merkel says Putin presented himself as\u00a0\"someone who was always on his guard, not to be trifled with, and always ready to dish it out.\"\nShe confirms a famous story that Putin brought his large Labrador to a private meeting with her. It is well-known that an earlier incident left Merkel with a phobia of dogs, but Putin has denied doing it on purpose to intimidate her.\nShe also says he regularly arrived late for the purpose of making people wait.\n\"You could find all this childish, reprehensible, you could shake your head at it,\" but that didn't make Russia any less important on the world stage, the ex-chancellor says. She goes on to describe him as singularly preoccupied with the United States, as if longing for the days of the Cold War.\nMerkel also sheds some light on her infamous first meeting with US President Donald Trump in 2017. An incident went viral on social media in which Merkel appeared\u00a0to ask Trump to shake hands for a photo, and he ignored her.\nTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video\nShe writes that he appeared to not understand her request, and then pelted her with questions about growing up under a dictatorship.\nHe was interested in\u00a0\"my East German background and my relationship with Putin. He was clearly very fascinated by the Russian president,\" Merkel says, adding:\u00a0\"In the years that followed, I had the impression that has was captivated by politicians with autocratic and dictatorial tendencies.\"\nShe asserts that Trump\u00a0spent the rest of their first meeting criticizing her.\n\"He claimed that I had ruined Germany by taking in so many refugees in 2015 and 2016, accused us of spending too little on defense and criticized us for unfair trade practices,\" according to Merkel.\nMerkel suggests that Trump saw everything through the eyes of a real estate mogul, and did not appear to understand the intertwined global economy, complaining about German cars on New York City streets.\n\"We were talking on two different levels,\u00a0Trump on the emotional level, me on the factual level. When he did pay attention to my arguments, it was mostly just to turn them into new accusations,\" she says. \"Resolving the issues raised did not appear to be his goal.\"\nIn the book, Merkel admits to being hesitant to accelerate Kyiv's bid to join NATO.\nShe\u00a0describes a 2008 NATO summit in Bucharest, where Ukraine\u00a0and Georgia's applications\u00a0to join the alliance were on the agenda.\nMerkel notes her\u00a0concerns over Kyiv's relationship with\u00a0Russia, although then-Ukrainian President\u00a0Viktor Yushchenko had sought closer ties to Europe. She also claims that at the time, only a minority of Ukrainians supported NATO membership, stressing the need for new NATO states\u00a0to add to the overall security for all members.\nMerkel has faced criticism from Ukrainians for being too hands-off in her approach to their country. She writes, however, that allowing Ukraine's membership bid to stand was a clear signal to Putin as to where the West stood.\nEdited by: Sean M.

            "content": "Angela Merkel was chancellor when Germany pulled the Bundeswehr out of Afghanistan and the Taliban conquered Kabul in 2021. She was the last witness to testify before a Bundestag committee of inquiry this week.\nThe\u00a0international mission in Afghanistan lasted 20 years. Under the leadership of the US, Germany was also involved from the very beginning \u2014 both in a military and in a humanitarian capacity.\nThe mission came to an abrupt end on August 15, 2021, when the Taliban captured the presidential palace in Kabul.\nNobody in the German government, including Chancellor Angela Merkel, apparently saw the Islamists' rapid triumph coming.\u00a0The evacuation of both German citizens and Afghan personnel was\u00a0chaotic.\nSince 2022, a committee of inquiry in the Lower House of Parliament, the Bundestag\u00a0has been trying to find out how this misjudgment came about. As the last witness, the former head of government has to answer several hours of questions from lawmakers.\nTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video\nReading from a prepared statement,\u00a0Merkel said Germany's participation in the US-led military invasion of Afghanistan was the correct decision even in retrospect. She repeated some of the phrases\u00a0she used in a government statement just a few days after the Taliban's triumph.\nMerkel said there had been a \"well-founded hope\" that the military intervention would prevent terrorist attacks from being planned in Afghanistan.\nShe acknowledged\u00a0that foreign governments had failed in Afghanistan on nearly every objective, from encouraging the rule of law to women's rights issues.\nMerkel said a lack of cultural understanding by Afghanistan's Western allies, nepotism and drug trafficking were reasons for the failures.\nMerkel says that initially, she was more reluctant to include local personnel from the field of development cooperation. In doing so, she wanted to avoid giving the impression that Germany was abandoning Afghanistan.\nMerkel's account is consistent with the testimony of her confidant at the time, Helge Braun, who coordinated the German government's Afghanistan policy in the Chancellery. Braun was questioned directly before Merkel in the committee of inquiry and also defended the Federal Intelligence Service (BND). The BND had considered a rapid takeover of power by the Taliban to be \u201crather unlikely\u201d.\nThe Bundestag's committee of inquiry has been looking\u00a0into decision-making procedures and actions of the German government and intelligence services, including the interaction with foreign actors.\nIt will have to present its final report before this legislative period ends in February 2025.\nMerkel-era Foreign Minister Heiko Maas and Development Minister Gerd M\u00fcller were among the last officials of the time to be\u00a0questioned. Even right\u00a0before the Taliban marched unopposed into the Afghan capital, Maas, of the Social Democratic Party\u00a0(SPD), had claimed that such a scenario was very unlikely.\n\"All of us \u2014 the German government, the intelligence services, the international community \u2014 we all misjudged the situation,\" he said later.\nNow, three years later, the inquiry committee asked Maas for his assessment of the German government's policy in Afghanistan. \"The cooperation within the government was very transparent and thorough,\" Maas said.\nMaas acknowledged that, on some specific factual issues, there were different interpretations.\n\"But everyone tried to make the best of the situation,\" Maas said. He added that issuing visas for Afghan personnel who feared Taliban revenge could have been handled better. \"It may have been possible to get a lot of people out earlier if an agreement had been reached more quickly,\" Maas surmised.\nThis article was originally written in German.

            "content": "Former German Chancellor Angela Merkel has told the BBC the gas deals she made with Russia were intended to help German firms and kept the peace with Moscow.\nShe also insisted the war with Ukraine would have started earlier if she hadn\u2019t blocked Kyiv\u2019s entry into Nato in 2008.\nAngela Merkel led Germany for 16 years. She was in office during the financial crisis, the 2015 migrant crisis and, significantly, Russia\u2019s 2014 invasion of Ukraine.\nWas she too soft on Moscow? Too slow to help Kyiv? If she hadn't blocked Ukraine\u2019s Nato membership in 2008, would there be a war there now?\nSpeaking to the BBC in Berlin, Mrs Merkel is robust in her defence of her time in office.\nShe says she believes the war in Ukraine would have started sooner and  would likely have been worse, if Kyiv had begun the path to Nato membership in 2008.\n\"We would have seen military conflict even earlier. It was completely clear to me that President Putin would not have stood idly by and watched Ukraine join Nato.\n\"And back then, Ukraine as a country would certainly not have been as prepared as it was in February 2022.\"\nUkraine President Volodymyr Zelensky disagrees.\nHe describes Mrs Merkel\u2019s Nato decision, backed by then-French President Nicolas Sarkozy, as a clear \"miscalculation\" that emboldened Russia.\nIn a rare interview since she stepped down from politics three years ago, Mrs Merkel expresses concern about Vladimir Putin\u2019s renewed threats of using nuclear weapons.\nThe two leaders got to know each other well over the course of two decades.\n\"We must do everything possible to prevent the use of nuclear weapons,\u201d the former German Chancellor says.\n\"Thankfully, China also spoke about this a while back. We shouldn't be paralysed by fear, but we must also acknowledge that Russia is the biggest, or alongside the US, one of the two biggest nuclear powers in the world.\n\"The potential is frightening.\"\nDespite enjoying high popularity ratings during most of her time in office, Mrs Merkel now finds herself on the defensive.\nShe has just published her memoir, Freedom. And the timing is interesting.\nShe says she did everything in her power to ensure peaceful means of co-operation with Russia.\nIn fact, Mr Putin launched his full-scale invasion of Ukraine just months after she left office.\nThis prompted a thorough re-examination in Europe of energy policies, diplomacy with Russia and also migration policies that had become the norm under Mrs Merkel.\nAt the helm of Europe\u2019s biggest economy, she was, as former Italian premier Matteo Renzi says, the de-facto leader of Europe - \"the boss of the European Union\".\n\"Do you remember when [former US Secretary of State] Henry Kissinger used to say 'what is the telephone number of Europe?',\" he says. \"My answer was: clearly, the mobile number of Angela Merkel.\"\nHe adds that when judging the Merkel legacy - over Russia and otherwise - it is important to remember the norms of the time.\n\"One cannot attack Angela for the relations with Russia,\" he says.\n\"In 2005, 2006 [they] were a goal of everyone in Europe, not only a goal of Angela Merkel.\"\nUnder Mrs Merkel, Germany and its energy-hungry big industries became dependent on Moscow. Germany built two gas pipelines directly linked to Russia.\nPresident Zelensky described that cheap gas as a geopolitical tool of the Kremlin.\nMrs Merkel tells the BBC she had two motives with the pipelines: German business interests but also maintaining peaceful links with Russia.\nFellow EU and Nato members in eastern Europe strongly disagreed with her.\nThe Polish MP, Radoslaw Fogiel, said German gas money filled Russia\u2019s war chest -  used to fund the invasion of Ukraine.\nMrs Merkel insists she tried to curb Russian attacks on Ukraine using diplomacy and negotiations, which - she admits - ultimately failed.\nAnd German industry has been disproportionately hit by sanctions on Russian energy. Forced to look for other suppliers, the country is now buying expensive LNG. Businesses says they are crippled by the costs.\nA new era in Europe\u2019s relations with Russia \"regrettably\" began following the full-scale invasion of Ukraine, says Mrs Merkel.\nOn Monday, defence ministers from the UK, France, Germany, Poland and Italy are meeting to discuss the deteriorating situation on Ukraine\u2019s frontlines.\nMs Merkel, 70, now finds herself having to defend her legacy in other areas too.\nThe migration crisis of 2015, when she famously opened Germany\u2019s doors to over a million asylum seekers, was perhaps the defining moment of her time in office.\nIt was hated by some, hailed by others.\nUS President Barack Obama praised her as a courageous and moral leader.\nBut critics blamed her for breathing life into the then almost redundant far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) party.\nIt is now polling comfortably in second place in German public opinion polls, ahead of a snap general election early next year.\nThe AfD\u2019s main political rallying cry: a strong anti-migrant message.\nAngela Merkel admits the AfD made big gains, but she makes no apology for her political decisions.\nAs for suggestions that her 2015 policies helped fuel anti-immigration and far-right parties elsewhere too, including the Netherlands, Poland and France, after she tried to impose migrant quotas across EU countries, Mrs Merkel says she can\u2019t be held responsible for all of Europe.\nThe only way to combat the far right is to stop illegal migration, she says.\nShe calls on Europe\u2019s leaders to invest more in African nations to improve standards of living there, so fewer people will be tempted to leave their homes.\nBut with Europe\u2019s economies sluggish, and voters worried about the cost of living, governments say there is little cash to spare.\nAngela Merkel appeared to put her country and its economic interests first when it came to buying Russian energy or during the eurozone crisis - when southern EU nations blamed her for squeezing them with austerity measures in order to rescue German banks and businesses.\nBut even at home in Germany, she is now accused of simply \"managing\" successive crises and failing to make far-reaching, perhaps painful reforms to future-proof her country and the EU.\nGermany is now labelled by some as \"the sick man of Europe\".\nOnce an export powerhouse on the world stage, its economy hovers just above recession.\nVoters complain she failed to invest in roads, railways and digitalisation, in favour of maintaining a balanced budget.\nUnder Angela Merkel, Germany not only became reliant on Russia for energy, but on China and the US for trade. Those decisions have not stood the test of time.\nDonald Trump threatens punishing tariffs on imports when he returns to the White House in January.\nMrs Merkel does have some thoughts for Europe\u2019s nervous leaders faced with  Trump 2.0.\nHis first term in office was marked by anger at Europe, particularly Germany, over low defence spending and trade deficits. Those gripes with Europe haven't changed.\nWhat are the Merkel tips for handling him?\n\"It\u2019s really important to know what your priorities are, to present them clearly and not to be scared, because Donald Trump can be very outspoken,\" she says.\n\"He expresses himself very clearly. And if you do that, there is a certain mutual respect. That was my experience anyway.\"\nBut Europe\u2019s leaders facing the US, China, and Russia, are apprehensive - arguably more so than during Angela Merkel\u2019s time.\nEconomies are sluggish, voters unhappy, traditional politics under pressure from the far-right and the far-left.\nChina and Russia are more bullish, the West weaker on the world stage.\nWars burn in the Middle East and in Europe, with Donald Trump appearing less interested in bolstering European security.\nPerhaps that\u2019s why Angela Merkel says, these days, when world leaders she knows well call her for advice, she happily responds.\nBut when I ask if she misses all that power and politics, her swift answer is: \"No, not at all.\"\nIn the UK, you can watch Katya Adler's full interview with Angela Merkel on BBC iPlayer.\nSome have long called for the practice of changing the clock twice a year to end.\nAs Argentina's libertarian President Javier Milei marks one year in office, his policies are keenly observed in the US.\nChina's ambassador is expected to attend and other officials may join him, two people told the BBC's US partner CBS.\nThe US president-elect comes into office with a strong economy, but investors hope for more and current highs may be difficult to sustain.\nThe incoming US president has vowed not to involve America in foreign conflicts, but Assad's dramatic fall has upended the region's balance of power.\nCopyright 2024 BBC.

The EU has identified 42 occupations with labor shortages and is implementing strategies to attract foreign talent. Italy plans to recruit 452,000 foreign workers by 2025, including 10,000 nurses from India. Germany is increasing skilled worker visas and promoting its labor needs, while the Netherlands acknowledges the importance of foreign workers for economic competitiveness. Governments are balancing public anti-immigration stances with the necessity of attracting skilled labor.",
            "content": "As aging populations exacerbate worker shortages, European countries are quietly luring skilled foreign workers \u2014 even as pressure from the far right to keep immigration down has increased.\nWith\u00a0immigration\u00a0the top political issue in Europe, particularly with the surge of the far right, pressure on governments to keep the numbers down has increased.\nAnd yet several countries, even those with a publicly anti-immigrant stance, are luring foreign workers to fill a large labor void and keep the\u00a0economies in an aging continent running.\nThe European Union\u00a0has identified\u00a042 occupations that face labor shortages and has come up with an action plan to attract foreign workers.\u00a0Nearly two-thirds of small and medium-sized businesses in the bloc say they cannot find the talent they need.\nOn the face of it, many European leaders, especially those on the far right, have advocated deals with third countries to curb the entry of immigrants or repatriate them elsewhere. And yet, amid\u00a0much less fanfare, signs of a policy shift acknowledging the need for immigrants have come to light.\nItaly's far-right government, led by Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni, has decided to recruit hundreds of thousands of foreign workers desperately needed to plug the gaping shortages.\n\"For the three-year period [from] 2023-2025, the government expects a total of 452,000 entries,'' the Italian government said last year, also admitting it is much less than the \"detected need of 833,000'' workers over that period of time.\nAccording to the IDOS Study and Research Center, Italy needs\u00a0280,000 foreign workers annually until 2050 to meet the labor shortfall in various sectors such as agriculture, tourism and health care \u2014\u00a0about half the number of asylum applications filed last year. The country faces labor shortages in 37 occupations, with nurses and other health care professionals in the most demand.\nThe government recently\u00a0announced it will recruit 10,000 nurses from India to help make up a shortage that is three times that much. Italian Health Minister Orazio Schillaci said in October that India has\u00a0an oversupply of\u00a0nurses.\u00a0\"There are 3.3 million nurses\" in India, he said. \"We want to bring here about 10,000.\"\nTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video\nSchillaci\u00a0said the Indian nurses are professionally capable and will be recruited directly by Italian regions and placed wherever needed, once their ability to speak in Italian has been determined.\nMaurizio Ambrosini, a professor of sociology and a migration expert at the University of Milan, told DW that Meloni's\u00a0government has been compelled to change policy by employers who are in desperate need of workers.\n\"Italian employers were very silent on the migration debate for years.\u00a0I suppose they didn't want a battle with the right-wing parties,'' he said over the phone. \"But no longer.\"\nMany, even in her own coalition, see the policy as a strong reversal from Meloni, who once referred to pro-immigration policies as part of a left-wing conspiracy to \u201creplace Italians with immigrants.\"\n\"I hoped now that we finally have a right-wing government the situation would change, but the right is getting worse than the left,'' said Attilio Lucia, a member of the far-right League party and the deputy mayor of Lampedusa, a tiny island that is the arriving port for many migrants.\nBusinesses may have also affected the thinking in the new Dutch\u00a0government led by far-right lawmaker Geert Wilders' Freedom Party.\nASML, the country's largest company that manufactures semiconductor equipment, has said its success depends on talented people, wherever they come from. The company has\u00a0suggested that inbound migration must not be restricted. Nearly 40% of the company's employees are foreign workers.\n\"We have built our company with more than 100 nationalities,\" Christophe Fouquet, ASML's CEO, \u00a0said at the Bloomberg Tech Summit in London last month. \"Bringing talent from everywhere has been an absolute condition for success, and this has to continue.\"\nTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video\nThe Netherlands has sought an exemption or an \"opt-out'' from\u00a0the EU asylum system, which treats asylum as \"a fundamental right and an international obligation for countries.\"\u00a0Media reports have suggested that high anti-immigrant rhetoric perpetuated by the far right has made skilled workers feel less welcome in the country.\nBut even the far-right political groups must grapple with the reality of just how much the companies\u00a0need foreign workers to stay competitive.\nThe Netherlands has only marginally reduced the tax incentive for foreign workers \u2014\u00a0from 30%\u00a0to just 27%. This tax break has been among the most attractive features for talented youth to move to the country, or \"knowledge migrants\" as the government calls them.\n\"This is a relatively small change in the total net income of highly skilled foreign workers,\"\u00a0said Lisa Timm, a researcher on\u00a0migration at the University of Amsterdam,\u00a0\"I think it will have a negligible effect on migrant arrivals.\"\nGermany is on course to issue 200,000 visas to skilled workers this year, a 10% increase from 2023. This is due to an \"Opportunity Card\"\u00a0scheme,\u00a0residence permits that allow\u00a0workers from countries outside the EU to come to Germany and seek employment, introduced in June.\nOn a recent visit to India, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz said Germany is \"open for skilled workers\"\u00a0and agreed to smooth out bureaucratic hurdles and increase visas for Indians from 20,000 to 90,000 annually.\nGermany needs around 400,000 new skilled employees a year to cover worker shortages, especially in the fields of engineering, IT and health care, and sees a potential workforce in trained Indians.\nOn the other hand, the rise of the far-right, anti-immigrant\u00a0Alternative for Germany (AfD) in regional elections and a knife attack in the western German town of Solingen over the summer compelled\u00a0Scholz\u00a0to sign off on internal border checks in the EU \"to curb migration.\"\nSpeaking on the issue in July, Scholz\u00a0said irregular migration to Germany\u00a0must \"come down\" but also stressed\u00a0the country's need for skilled foreigners.\nNearly all European countries face the same problem \u2014\u00a0labor shortages in an aging population. Despite an influx of immigrants, they don't want to appear to be allowing for migrant arrivals without\u00a0visas.\nAmbrosini, the University of Milan professor,\u00a0said European countries are\u00a0having\u00a0trouble reconciling\u00a0two different immigration policies, one for public consumption that calls for \"border enforcement agreements with transit countries like Tunisia, or deportation to external facilities like Italy's Albania agreement.\n\"On the other hand, it is becoming clearer that they need workers, and they are coming up with new policies to attract a workforce that is not only skilled but also seasonal workers,\" he said. \"This second policy is kept a bit hidden, not too much publicized, and can be visible only to the employer associations.\"\nIn the end, it's about the governments being able to say they are in control of who is coming in and who gets to stay,\u00a0said Ambrosini.\u00a0But that's a myth, at least regarding blue-collar jobs, since employers receive references from those already in Europe for whom to hire.\n\"How will the employer know who to get from Peru, for instance?\"\nEdited by: Davis VanOpdorp",

Their situation prompted public outcry and political advocacy, leading to temporary work permits for training. German health minister Karl Lauterbach emphasized the necessity of foreign workers in healthcare. The government aims to streamline labor migration and decrease asylum applications from Colombians, advocating for proper immigration pathways to prevent similar cases. Current policies are focused on establishing migration partnerships to facilitate skilled labor entry and reduce reliance on asylum processes.",
            "content": "The case of 10 Colombian care workers has caused outrage in Germany where there's a desperate shortage of nursing staff. Experts say it illustrates the problems with the immigration system.\nAndrea and Tino Wohlmacher ought to be celebrating. But the managers of a home for 48 dementia patients in Wilstedt, near Bremen, simply have too much to do before Christmas. They've just scored their first small victory against Germany's labyrinthine bureaucratic system of asylum applications, skilled worker immigration\u00a0and deportations.\nThe 10 caregivers from Colombia that they employ have been granted permission to stay for the time being. Two- or three-year training contracts will allow them to stay and will prevent\u00a0them from being repatriated. \"We all breathed a huge sigh of relief,\" Andrea Wohlmacher told DW.\nThe story of the 10 Colombians illustrates the difficulties Germany faces in attracting and retaining urgently needed workers while maintaining a clear distinction between asylum and labor migration at the same time. This is because the untrained workers from South America submitted applications for asylum \u2014 and they were rejected.\nFor this reason, they were not permitted to change their applicant status to that of skilled workers. This meant that the Colombians were in danger of being forced to leave Germany, and as a result, the care facility would likely be forced to close due to a lack of staff.\nTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video\n\"We are, I think, a perfect example of why migration is necessary. And not just for skilled workers. In Germany, we've had a shortage of workers for decades, especially in the care sector,\" said Andrea Wohlmacher.\nAccording to the German Council for Nursing (DPR), there is already a shortage of around 115,000 professional nursing staff in full-time positions. The labor market is in dire straits and many hospitals, care services, and retirement homes can only survive with staff from abroad.\nWhen their 10 employees were threatened with deportation, the two directors in Wilstedt pulled out all the stops and made their case public. They wrote an open letter to eight politicians, prompting dozens of television crews to flock to Wilstedt. A petition to the German government received 83,782 signatures and German health minister Karl Lauterbach even accepted the petition in person.\nThe case sparked outrage throughout Germany: How can it be that people who are well integrated, who pay their taxes, and who are there day and night for people in need of care, are being told to leave the country?\nBut there is also another aspect to consider: What kind of signal is Germany sending abroad if rejected asylum-seekers can somehow remain in the country even without the appropriate training? The final decision now lies with a commission in the state of Lower Saxony responsible for handling exceptional cases.\nWhen the petition was handed to Lauterbach, he promised to do whatever was in his power, adding: \"We wouldn't be able to provide the same standard of care in Germany if we didn't have so many care workers from abroad.\" He said he wants to send a clear message: \"Foreign care workers are more than welcome here because we depend on them and have had very positive experiences with them.\"\nAndrea Wohlmacher firmly believes that without the publicity and talks with politicians at every level, the Colombian caregivers would probably still be facing the threat of deportation. The education permit that has staved off their deportation for the time being will now give the care home and its team a little breathing room. The 10 caregivers are currently being trained as nursing assistants, nurses and cooks.\nThat is why the man who is tasked with ensuring that the immigration of skilled workers to Germany takes place in an orderly manner \u2014 in other words, not by means of a potentially hopeless asylum application \u2014 recently held talks in the Colombian capital Bogota.\nFor almost two years, Joachim Stamp has been the German government's special advisor for migration agreements.\n\"We want to reduce unauthorized migration and enable better management of labor migration. I have also made it clear in the Colombian media that the way into the German labor market is not through asylum law, but only through the proper immigration of skilled workers,\" Stamp told DW.\nTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video\nThis is because the latest approval rate for asylum seekers from Colombia was 0.4%, meaning that only one in 250 Colombians had their asylum application approved. At the same time, however, an increasing number of Colombians are trying to immigrate to Germany by making applications for asylum. While the number of applications was 138 in 2018, last year 3,337 people from Colombia applied for asylum in Germany.\nThere are currently 14,000 Colombians living in Germany who are working and paying social security contributions. In addition, there are 3,500 students and postgraduates, as well as around 500 academics.\nGermany aims to promote the regular migration of workers and decrease the number of ineligible asylum applications by establishing comprehensive migration partnerships with countries such as Colombia, Georgia, Uzbekistan, Morocco and Kenya. The aim is to prevent cases like the one in the Wilstedt care facility from happening again in the future.\n\"It is a tragedy when nice and hard-working people are exploited by smugglers and misled into seeking asylum. Many people are clearly being purposefully misinformed by the smuggling networks,\" said Joachim Stamp. \"Colombians who want to come to Germany should find their way into the job market and not into refugee shelters.\"\nThis article was originally published in German.\nWhile you're here: Every Tuesday, DW editors round up what is happening in German politics and society.

A significant concern is the potential return of Donald Trump as U.S. president, which could disrupt transatlantic relations and impact support for Ukraine. German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock affirmed Germany's commitment to Ukraine, while experts suggest Germany may need to increase military spending amid security threats. Additionally, the situation in the Middle East, including the aftermath of the Hamas attack on Israel, adds complexity to Germany's foreign policy. Public opinion shows mixed support for a more active German role in global security.",
            "content": "Germany will hold new federal elections in February 2025. But regardless of who leads the next government, foreign policy will remain challenging.\nIt seems likely that Germany's biggest foreign policy challenge in 2025 will stem from the next US president, Donald Trump. He is expected to oppose much of what was prioritized by\u00a0Chancellor Olaf Scholzand his recently ruptured center-left coalition government.\n\"It is now clear that the old formula \u2014 that we can rely on the US to safeguard our security \u2014 no longer applies,\" Thorsten Benner, director of the Global Public Policy Institute (GPPI) in Berlin, told DW.\u00a0\"Trump is the new rule \u2014 and four years under Biden were the last twitches of the old transatlanticism.\"\nAs a consequence, Germany must prepare for a world \"in which we have to pay much more for our own security in Europe, and to do that while there is a war\u00a0on the European continent,\" Brenner added.\nTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video\nNext year's foreign policy shifts may well be most obvious in the way they affect\u00a0the war in Ukraine. Trump recently reiterated that he would \"certainly\" cut support to Ukraine \u2014 and called for an \"immediate ceasefire.\"\nWhat would that mean for Germany? Foreign Minister\u00a0Annalena Baerbock of the Greens, set out some of the country's positions at the Berlin Foreign Policy Forum\u00a0in mid-November: \"Germany stands by Ukraine, irrespective of the US election results,\" she said, adding that \"there can be no peace negotiations over Ukrainian heads.\" With that statement, Baerbock was responding to Trump's hints that he could end the war in Ukraine through direct talks with Russian President Vladimir Putin.\nTo avoid that scenario, Benner believes Germany should \"approach the Trump administration with an offer.\" One possibility might be: \"We will pay you to continue to supply\u00a0military goods to Ukraine.\" Europe simply doesn't have the manufacturing capacity to supply\u00a0the same level of military aid to Ukraine that the US has \u2014 but it could finance it.\nBenner is convinced that Germany must increase its spending on Ukraine, as well as on general security. However, given Germany's tight budget, it could only do so by taking on new debt.\nThe second major foreign policy challenge is the Middle East. The ousting of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad by rebel groups in early December has greatly complicated the situation there. While Syrians are celebrating the end of Assad's rule, which was supported by Russia and Iran, Germany is still waiting to see whether Islamists will enforce religious rule in Syria, which could trigger new streams of refugees coming to Europe. But the upheaval in Syria is only one event, albeit the most recent, in the Middle East.\nFollowing the Hamas terrorist attack on Israel on October 7, 2023, the subsequent retaliation by Israel in the Gaza Strip, and its fight against Hezbollah in southern Lebanon, Germany has been attempting a balancing act.\nTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video\nOn the one hand, it has supplied Israel with weapons\u00a0on the basis of what Germany calls a \"reason of state.\" On the other, in numerous trips to the region, Baerbock has advocated for Palestinians and de-escalation.\n\"The balancing act was not perfect, but doing it any other way than it has been done so far\u00a0would have been difficult,\" said Hans-Jakob Schindler, Middle East expert at the Counter Extremism Project (CEP).\nThe entire European Union substantially reduced its involvement in the Middle East conflict many years ago, and\u00a0Schindler notes that since October 7, the EU and Germany have had \"hardly any weight in the talks, when it came to the decisions.\" \"So it was really an American-Israeli dialogue, and the Europeans were \u2014 at most \u2014 spectators, offering comments from the sidelines,\" he told DW.\nWith Trump as\u00a0US president, the question is: \"How will he reconcile his very pro-Israeli position with his goal of ending conflicts?\"\nSchindler is convinced that \"Germany and Europe will not develop any kind of stronger position that might influence the conflict.\" He believes that only\u00a0in the best case scenario \u2014 some future reconstruction in the Gaza Strip and southern Lebanon \u2014 may Europe be able to\u00a0reassert itself\u00a0by becoming actively involved.\nFor three years, Baerbock has been Germany's primary foreign policy figure \u2014 and has occasionally tried to champion\u00a0human rights, openly addressing\u00a0human rights violations with important trading partners like China.\nHowever, during a 2023 press conference with then-Chinese Foreign Minister Qin Gang, he responded by saying, \"What China needs least of all is a teacher from the West.\"\nThorsten Benner says that values-based foreign policies are difficult to implement. \"Of course, it's good to have an ambitious target \u2014 to avoid falling into overly complicated realpolitik compromises too easily. But I believe even Ms. Baerbock herself, in any future German coalition, might no longer wish to anchor a values-based foreign policy in the same way,\" he said.\nTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video\nOpinion polls suggest that\u00a0the next German government will most likely be led by the Christian Democratic Union (CDU)\u00a0and its Bavarian sister-party the\u00a0Christian Social Union (CSU), under a Chancellor Friedrich Merz. Henning Hoff of the German Council on Foreign Relations (DGAP), believes a Merz-led foreign policy won't actually be that different from Germany's current one. \"There's a consensus on foreign policy that we have in Germany. This is a stabilizing factor during this time of crisis,\" Hoff told DW. That consensus holds that the country must become more active in foreign and security policy.\nThe German population, however, is not fully on board with this. In a survey commissioned by the K\u00f6rber Foundation right after the US election \u2014 and shortly after Scholz's coalition collapsed \u2014 73% of respondents said Germany should invest more in European security. However, 58% were against Germany taking on a leading role in the West, should the US withdraw from the international stage.\nAs far as NATO is concerned, a YouGov survey conducted in mid-November after Trump's election showed that only 33% of Germans felt their country should play a greater role in NATO leadership. Another 41% wanted it to play an equally strong role, and 16% wanted it to play a lesser role.\nIt seems that any new German government, no matter who leads it, will also face a challenge on the domestic front: Convincing Germans that their country should assume more global responsibility.\nThis article was originally written in German.\nWhile you're here: Every Tuesday, DW editors round up what is happening in German politics and society.

Flagship German companies like Volkswagen are in deep trouble, people are worried about their jobs and are struggling with rising prices and rents.\nMarco Wanderwitz of the center-right Christian Democrats (CDU) was the federal commissioner for the eastern German states until 2021, and told DW: \"The biggest problem we have in this country right now is that our economy is stuttering. And that is really affecting the foundations and the future. The big problem is that we have a loss of confidence in politics among economic leaders.\"\nTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video\nThe government is being blamed for high energy prices, high wage levels, the deterioration of infrastructure, a shortage of skilled workers and too much bureaucracy.\nAccording to Omid Nouripour, former leader of the Green Party, the last point in particular is showcased by the country's sluggish digitalization.\n\"We have a twofold crisis, both economically and structurally,\" he told DW. \"You can see this, for example, in government offices, where fax machines are still considered a top means of communication. And you can see that in the investment backlog in this country.\"\nThese problems are exacerbated by external cyber-attacks, many from Russia, on infrastructure such as the country's power grids. \"The most important thing is to protect critical infrastructure,\" Nouripour said. \"We have too many vulnerabilities in this area. And there are too many players putting pressure on critical infrastructure.\"\nThis is why strengthening the police and intelligence services is an important task\u00a0for the coming year.\nTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video\nTwo other issues that have long been identified as problems will pose a far greater challenge for a future government than they have so far: Immigration and the question of how the country should deal with the apparent rise of populism and far-right extremism.\u00a0The Christmas market attack in Magdeburg highlighted this problem.\nBoth the number of applications for asylum and the estimated number of irregular immigrants have actually gone down in recent years, even though the European border protection agency Frontex estimates that around 166,000 people attempted to enter the EU irregularly in the first nine months of 2024.\nGermany has reintroduced controls at all its borders, and the conservative CDU, which has a good chance of leading the next government after the February election, has now come out in favor of turning back refugees at the borders.\nMany local authorities say they have reached their limit when it comes to receiving and caring for refugees. Stefan Seidler from the S\u00fcdschleswigscher W\u00e4hlerverband (SSW), a party representing Germany's Frisian and Danish minority in the north of the country, says he has seen this first-hand.\n\"What I can say from my perspective is that the municipalities are currently facing a huge task that they can hardly cope with,\" he told DW. \"What they need is support from the federal government.\"\nWanderwitz, who is not running as a candidate for the Bundestag again, begs to differ. He believes immigration is manageable, though he knows how polarizing the issue is. \"The numbers have gone down,\" he explained, and he feels the problems have been exaggerated. \"I actually only know local politicians who say it's much less bad than in 2014 or 2015. But despite this, everyone has somehow raised the white flag,\" Wanderwitz said.\nNouripour believes the number of refugees heading to Germany may rise again. \"We know that the situation in Ukraine could lead to more refugees, and we can see that one conflict or another could escalate further in the Middle East,\" he cautioned.\nTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video\nMeanwhile, the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) is expected to make gains in February's election.\n\"We are currently experiencing massive pressure from the far right,\" Seidler warned. He is concerned about safeguarding the rights of minorities. \"We are currently seeing those gain momentum who think that it is the majority alone who decides. But as a minority politician, I can only say clearly and unequivocally: A good democracy also shows consideration for its minorities.\"\nThis is part of the reason why Seidler supported a motion tabled in the Bundestag by the opposition CDU/CSU bloc, the center-left Social Democrats (SPD) and\u00a0Greens currently forming a minority government and their former coalition partner, the neoliberal Free Democrats (FDP) to protect the independence of the Federal Constitutional Court against political interference. The reform raises the bar to alter the rules of the court, one thing that could be agreed on by the required two-thirds majority in the German parliament \u2014 even at a time of fierce election campaigning.\nAll politicians agree that 2025 will be another tough year, with fierce disputes and many crises to solve.\nThis article was originally written in German.\nWhile you're here: Every Tuesday, DW editors round up what is happening in German politics and society.
