Western sanctions imposed on Russia are “killing” German companies and enriching the American economy, Sahra Wagenknecht, the leader of Germany’s left-wing BSW party, said during an election conference on Sunday.
Delegates of the Sahra Wagenknecht Alliance – Reason and Justice (BSW) gathered in the city of Bonn to adopt their platform for the Bundestag election, set to take place next month. During her speech, Wagenknecht refused to blame Russia for the Ukraine conflict.
“The sanctions have nothing to do with morality, they have nothing to do with human rights, they have nothing to do with the love of peace, they are simply a stimulus program for the US economy and a killer program for German and European companies,” Wagenknecht said.
She called for the restoration of natural gas imports from Russia. “We simply have to tie our energy imports with the criteria of the lowest price and not any kind of double standards or ideology,” she stated.
The left-wing politician condemned Washington’s foreign policy, and “the blood trail of US proxy wars” around the globe. She stressed that the German chancellor must not be “a vassal” of the US.
BSW co-leader Amira Mohamed Ali said the party stands for “a strong, fair and sovereign Germany.”
The right-wing Alternative for Germany (AfD) party held its conference in Riesa, Saxony on Saturday. The delegates rejected a motion condemning Russia, and called for a diplomatic resolution of the conflict.
The snap election was called after Germany’s ruling three-party coalition collapsed last month due to disagreements over the budget.
