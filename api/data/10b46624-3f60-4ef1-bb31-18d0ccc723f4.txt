  Elon Musk has been condemned as "a mixture of mad and right-wing extremist" by professor Jens-Christian Wagner, a historian who runs the Buchenwald concentration camp memorial, the largest in Germany.Wagner made the comments during an interview with The Times of London in which he urged the billionaire businessman to "please be quiet with the poison he's spreading."Newsweek contacted Wagner, via the Buchenwald memorial, and Musk, using the Tesla and SpaceX press offices, for comment on Friday by email outside of regular office hours.Why It MattersMusk has emerged as one of the most influential figures associated with President Donald Trump's second administration, having spent more than $250 million supporting the Republican firebrand's election campaign. On Monday, Trump created the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) via executive order, which will be co-led by Musk.In recent weeks, Musk has endorsed a number of right-wing groups and individuals in Europe, including British anti-Islam campaigner Tommy Robinson and the Alternative for Germany (AfD) party, leaders of which have made "antisemitic, anti-Muslim and anti-democratic statements," according to the anti-Defamation League.

  What To KnowSpeaking to The Times about Musk, Wagner, an expert on Nazi persecution, said: "One can only say to him, 'Take a history book and withdraw for three days, read the history book and please be quiet with the poison he's spreading.'"I think Musk is a mixture of mad and right-wing extremist and that is particularly dangerous."An estimated 56,000 people were murdered by the Nazis at Buchenwald between 1937 and its liberation by American soldiers in 1945, including Jews, Soviet prisoners of war and political prisoners.In December, Musk wrote an article for the German Welt am Sonntag newspaper in which he called the AfD the "last spark of hope" for the country, which he claimed was on "the brink of economic and cultural collapse."Musk went on to host a livestream on X, the social media platform formerly known as Twitter that he now owns, with AfD co-leader Alice Weidel. During the conversation, he said: "People really need to get behind the AfD, otherwise things are going to get very, very much worse in Germany."The AfD says its aim is to radically reduce immigration to Germany and improve economic growth by slashing taxes and regulations. However, a 2023 report by the German Institute for Human Rights concluded that its aim is "to eliminate the free democratic basic order."In May 2024, the AfD suffered a wave of infighting after Maximilian Krah, one of its members of the European Parliament, sparked controversy by saying members of the Nazi SS weren't automatically "criminals."On Monday, Musk was accused of giving two fascist salutes at Trump's "presidential parade" shortly after his inauguration. However, the business tycoon insisted he was merely gesturing to the crowd after commenting "my heart goes out to you," and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Musk was being "falsely smeared" in a post on X.What People Are SayingElon Musk, on X: "It was astonishing how insanely hard legacy media tried to cancel me for saying 'my heart goes out to you' and moving my hand from my heart to the audience."In the end, this deception will just be another nail in the coffin of legacy media."Bari Weiss, founder of The Free Press: "The people that are making such a fuss about this arm gesture are the people who have been completely silent or morally equivocating since October 7 [the Hamas attack in Israel in 2023]."Democratic Representative Jerry Nadler of New York, on X: "I never imagined we would see the day when what appears to be a Heil Hitler salute would be made behind the Presidential seal. This abhorrent gesture has no place in our society and belongs in the darkest chapters of human history."Jewish conservative commentator Ben Shapiro described the incident as "another episode of everybody I don't like is Hitler."What Happens NextIf Musk continued promoting fringe right-wing political figures and parties in Europe, it risks creating a rift between the Trump administration and some of America's closest allies in NATO.There has been widespread speculation in Britain that Musk could make a donation of up to $100 million to Reform UK, a right-wing party, though nothing has been officially confirmed.
