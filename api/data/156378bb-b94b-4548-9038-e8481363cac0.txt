Vice President-elect JD Vance promoted Elon Musk’s recent op-ed in support of Germany’s far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) party. Vance shared the op-ed on Thursday and wrote, “I’m not endorsing a party in the German elections, as it’s not my country and we hope to have good relations with all Germans. But this is an interesting piece.”
“Also interesting; American media slanders AfD as Nazi-lite, But AfD is most popular in the same areas of Germany that were most resistant to the Nazis,” Vance added. Vance’s claim was quickly shot down by German journalist James Jackson who shared electoral maps from 1932 and 2024 showing that regional overlap for the AfD and the Nazi party in northeastern Germany.

The German Ambassador to the US, Andreas Michaelis, also refuted Vance’s claim, replying, “Interesting observation, Senator JD Vance. Historical context can be tricky – while some areas you are referring to resisted the Nazi party early on, others did not, or later became strongholds of the regime. Germany’s history reminds us how important it is to challenge extremism in all its forms.”

Musk stirred controversy last month when he endorsed the party, which has long been controversial both across Europe and in the U.S. Musk wrote on his X platform that “only the AfD can save Germany.” The AfD is polling strongly in Germany’s upcoming election, but is seen as unlikely to be voted into a position to govern the country as the other parties have vowed not to work with them. Germany publicly accused Musk earlier in the week of trying to influence its elections.
Sen. Chris Murphy (D-CT) addressed Musk’s support for the AfD in late December on CNN, “Yeah. I mean, this is not normal. So AfD is essentially the neo-Nazi party in Germany. They exist to try to rehabilitate the image of the Nazi party. And they have all sorts of very dangerous ideas about ridding Germany of anyone who is not naturally born in that country. They are an extremist group,” Murphy replied, adding:
And it is just extraordinary that maybe the most important advisor to the president of the United States, somebody that has been, you know, parading around the halls of Congress as a key advisor to the president, is endorsing a neo-Nazi party inside Germany.
Germany’s DW news agency describes the party’s platform as one that “insists on the primacy of “traditional” German culture and rejects Islam as a part of German society. It also questions the notion that climate change is man-made, wants to uphold family values and opposes diversity and gender issues. The AfD wants to limit NATO’s operational area to the territory of its member states and replace the EU with a new organization.”
DW also noted, “The AfD has a powerful extremist section which the domestic intelligence service is keeping tabs on.”
