Protests organized on Saturday by an alliance of activists against the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) have delayed the start of the party's conference in the eastern German state of Saxony.
The protests come as three of Germany's major political parties are holding gatherings on the same day to finalize their election platforms and candidate nominations ahead of the national elections on February 23.
Early polls were called following the collapse of Chancellor Olaf Scholz's three-party coalition in November.
Several demonstrators blocked access roads leading to the venue and by 10 am (0900 GMT) only a fraction of the approximately 600 delegates had reportedly arrived at the venue.
Protest organizers said they expected more than 10,000 people to participate in the demonstrations against the AfD.
AfD party chairwoman, Alice Weidel, who is to be named as the party's candidate for chancellor at the two-day convention, was also held up, according to information from AfD sources.
Authorities were braced for violent protests, with a large police presence, water cannons and a helicopter monitoring the situation.
Police said there were already isolated attempts to breach barriers upon the protesters' arrival in the morning.
According to a dpa reporter, irritant gas was used to disperse protesters who had trapped police cars. Demonstrators had deflated the tires of several police vehicles. Pyrotechnics were also thrown at police during another protest march.
