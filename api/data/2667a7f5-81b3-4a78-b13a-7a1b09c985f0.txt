BERLIN – Welcome to Friedrich Merz’s nightmare. 
For months, the standard-bearer of Germany’s centre-right Christian Democrats (CDU/CSU) did everything he could to keep migration, the one issue he knew he couldn’t dominate, from becoming the focus of the election.
Faced with a resurgent anti-migrant Alternative for Germany (AfD) to his right, and weighed down by the open borders legacy of long-time CDU Chancellor Angela Merkel, Merz tried hard to focus attention on the economy. With his centre-right bloc favoured to win the country’s 23 February election by a wide margin, Merz was playing it safe.
The murder of a two-year-old boy by a deranged asylum-seeker this month – the latest in a string of similar killings – forced Merz to embrace a radical change in tack.
After years of insisting he would never under any circumstances collaborate with the AfD, even passively, he relented this week. 
On Wednesday, Merz pushed through a non-binding motion in favour of an immigration crackdown with support from the AfD, breaking with Germany’s tradition of consensus-driven, centrist politics. Many fear it will only further embolden the far right.
The ensuing German turmoil could be a precursor of what is to follow in the EU, as cracks are starting to show in Merz’s European centre-right camp.
The CDU leader has committed to implementing an explosive five-point plan, laid out in his motion, “on Day 1” if he becomes chancellor. If enacted, Germany would permanently reinstate border checks and indiscriminately turn away all irregular arrivals, including asylum seekers – a “de-facto freeze of admissions”.
In the eyes of his opponents, it means that “the largest country in the EU would openly violate EU law like only Viktor Orban has done previously”, as the incumbent chancellor, Olaf Scholz, told lawmakers on Wednesday.
Final brick  
The Merz plan is only the final brick in the wall that Germany has gradually raised around the country since Angela Merkel’s decision to keep Germany’s borders open to refugees in 2015.
It comes as a response to a new surge in migration: Between 2021 and 2023 the number of asylum applications and registered illegal arrivals in Germany roughly doubled.
Scholz’s government has since enacted previously unthinkable measures – from temporary controls at all borders to greenlighting detention centres for irregular migrants.
But while arrivals and asylum applications are falling, deportations remain an eye-catching problem. Over the last two years, Germany consistently deported fewer than 10 per cent of 'Dublin cases' – asylum seekers who end up in Germany that other EU countries are legally responsible for handling. Rejected refugees were named as suspects in three fatal attacks over the last 12 months.
Scholz’s government has so far refused to pull out the final stop and indiscriminately block the entry of all illegal arrivals.
If he becomes chancellor, Merz has made clear he would be willing to take that step.



Schengen’s vision of a border-free Europe under pressure in Germany
German opposition parties and parts of the government coalition are calling for more border checks to tackle irregular migration, questioning the consensus on Schengen that has long been taken for granted in the country that borders most EU member states.

Confrontation
The government is uneasy, mainly because many experts deem this a violation of EU law.
“If someone applies for asylum, they cannot be turned away, even if they do not have any papers,” said Winfried Kluth, the chair of the German government’s Expert Council on Integration and Migration, pointing to European law.
The identification of ‘Dublin’ cases also requires admitting asylum-seekers first. While the CDU suggests that an emergency clause in EU law could overrule such provisions, the European Court of Justice has so far rejected all its applications.
Merz risks an unprecedented confrontation with European courts but also with Germany’s neighbours. They are predominantly ruled by leaders from Merz's own European People’s Party (EPP) and have been keen to pass on migratory burdens to Germany.
This is a problem for Merz, who has promised a new era of European coordination. After a meeting with EPP leaders two weeks ago, he vowed that they would take steps "to jointly solve the problem of illegal migration in Europe”.
But little unity is left when it comes to the German border. Austria’s chancellor, Alexander Schallenberg of the Christian Democratic Austrian People’s Party (ÖVP), all but distanced himself from Merz on Monday.
When the CDU floated similar plans last autumn, Austrian interior minister Gerhard Karner (ÖVP) had vowed that Austria “won’t take back” any rejected migrants. Similar comments came from EPP-led Poland.
The CDU has in turn reacted with indignation. Merz’s right-hand man on migration, the CDU’s chief whip Thorsten Frei, argued that rejections at the border would not require neighbouring countries to take migrants back.
“That's why we have to tell the Austrian interior minister – that person is in Austria and is staying in Austria and if you want to prevent him from being there, make sure that he doesn't enter Austria,” Frei told journalists, among them Euractiv, on Tuesday.
Pointing to the ratio between size and arrivals, Frei said: “If there is one country in Europe that is disproportionately burdened with migration, it is Germany and no other.”
The day before, Merz had indicated that his patience is running out.
It was important to talk to neighbours, who were asking many questions, he said.
“But I believe that we can't just talk now, we have to act.”
The EU's likely next leadership trio believe they are keeping Europe from sliding far-right – it won't be so easy.
Breakdown?
Opinions are divided on what would happen if Merz enacts his plans against European resistance.
The CDU hopes for a domino effect, which would eventually lead to a stricter enforcement of European rules by its neighbours and fewer arrivals in Germany.
The current government does not think so.
“If we opt out of the European rules, others will opt out too,” Scholz said.
His interior ministry described a worst-case scenario, in which any cooperation on migration breaks down. That is already the case with Italy, to which Germany only managed to return three ‘Dublin’ cases last year.
Kluth said, rejections increase the risk that asylum-seekers go into hiding after being turned down or become “refugees in orbit” that get deported repeatedly without anyone taking responsibility.
“It would amount to declaring the Common European Asylum System defunct,” he added.
He therefore has little understanding for the solo efforts Merz is teasing.
“Desired improvements can be negotiated and implemented together. It does not seem impossible that majorities can be found for this.”
