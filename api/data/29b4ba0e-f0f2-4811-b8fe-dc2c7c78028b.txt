Alice Weidel, a co-leader of the right-wing Alternative for Germany (AfD) party, has apparently adapted US President-elect Donald Trump’s MAGA (‘Make America Great Again’) slogan, but for her own continent. The politician has called to ‘Make Europe Great Again’ in a post on X on Wednesday, which has since been deleted.
Weidel was responding to a post drawing parallels between her party’s program and policies advocated by Trump and US-based tech billionaire Elon Musk. The SpaceX and Tesla CEO, who also owns X, has endorsed AfD and interviewed Weidel live on his platform last week.
The German politician later deleted her post. According to Berliner Zeitung, the move could have reflected her suspicion that the post she had responded to was published by a fake account.
During the interview, the German politician described AfD as a “libertarian conservative party” that is seeking to reduce bureaucracy and “free the people from the state.” Musk also repeatedly stated that “only AfD can save Germany” ahead of the 2025 snap parliamentary election in the EU nation scheduled for late February.
The early vote was announced following the collapse of a three-party coalition led by Chancellor Olaf Scholz’s Social Democrats and a subsequent vote of no confidence in his remaining minority government in December.

Musk also interviewed Donald Trump last year as a gesture of support for the Republican's ultimately successful presidential bid.
The ‘Make America Great Again’ (MAGA) slogan was popularized by Trump during his first successful election campaign in 2016 and then used by him again in 2024. The MAGA acronym is also often used to describe his supporters and political base.
The tech billionaire’s interview with Weidel last week drew some controversy in Germany. Over 60 German universities and research institutes announced their departure from X, citing the supposedly “increasing radicalization” on the site. Two labor unions and the top federal court have also departed from the platform.
The German Defense Ministry and the Armed Forces (the Bundeswehr) followed suit on Wednesday by announcing that they will no longer make any posts on the platform, claiming that X makes it “difficult to have a factual exchange.”
