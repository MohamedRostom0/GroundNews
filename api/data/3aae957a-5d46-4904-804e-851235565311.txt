By becoming the moderate face of the AfD, Alice Weidel helped transform the party from a fringe movement into a dominant force, forcing its rivals to rethink their electoral strategy.


 


Weidel's private life reveals contradictions some argue clash with the traditional values of the far-right movement. She has lived abroad, is openly in a same-sex relationship, and splits her time between Germany and Switzerland. But rather than hindering her rise, these complexities have fuelled Weidel's climb to power, positioning the 46-year-old as a contender for the chancellorship.


 


In this episode, host Giada Santana is joined by Berlin-based politics reporter Nick Alipour to examine the AfD's transformation under Weidel’s leadership.
