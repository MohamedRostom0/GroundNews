A desire to increase support to Ukraine was one of the reasons Germany’s centre-left Chancellor gave for sacking his fiscally-conservative finance minister, but now he’s backpedalling.

BERLIN – German Chancellor Olaf Scholz's latest dithering over promised funding for Ukraine underscores the indecisiveness that has characterised his government's handling of Ukraine and Germany’s rearmament ever since Russia began its all-out invasion nearly three years ago.
On Monday, Scholz backpedalled on his plan for a €3 billion top-up to his country's €4 billion military-aid budget for Ukraine.
BERLIN – German Chancellor Olaf Scholz's latest dithering over promised funding for Ukraine underscores the indecisiveness that has characterised his government's handling of Ukraine and Germany’s rearmament ever since Russia began its all-out invasion nearly three years ago.
"I had suggested extending this at some point, but if you do that, you also have to say where the money is coming from," Scholz said at an event in Bielefeld, North-Rhine Westphalia.
The chancellor, not for the first time, has changed his tune. In November, he sacked his finance minister, Christian Lindner, partly because Lindner opposed Scholz's plan to fund the top-up with extra borrowing.
The decision to sack Lindner finally scuttled the beleaguered governing coalition of Scholz's centre-left Social Democratic Party (SDP), Lindner's liberal and fiscally conservative Free Democratic Party (FDP), and the Greens.
Germany will hold a national election in February, with the centre-right Christian Democratic Union (CDU) poised to oust the SPD and Greens.
Yet now, having spent the last of his political capital on the matter, Scholz isn't even sure he wants to spend the money.
"I'm against taking it from pensions. I'm against us doing this by making cuts to the municipalities. I'm against investing less money in roads," the chancellor said.
He argued that the collapse of the "traffic light" coalition – named for the three parties' official colours of red, yellow and green – meant there remained a budget gap, as well as failure to pass a 2025 national budget.
'Extortion'
Lindner characterised Scholz's "manoeuvre" on raising the debt ceiling as "extortion." That he's now holding-up the aid shows that the chancellor's priorities do not lie with Ukraine, Lindner told Mediengruppe Bayern.
The Greens aren't happy either. "Why the chancellery has now completely changed its mind and suddenly no longer sees a need, is beyond the comprehension of anyone with a sense of reason," said Green lawmaker Agnieskza Burgger.
It's been almost three years since Scholz promised to give his country's atrophied defence forces a massive shot in the arm, at the same time as providing substantial military aid to Ukraine's defensive war against the Russian invasion. At the time, he proclaimed a "Zeitenwende," a 'turning point.'
The German rearmament that started with a €100 billion fund has withered so much that it would take the country up to a century to restore the military stockpiles it had 20 years ago, according to the Kiel Institute, a think tank.
In the meantime, the government prevaricated over whether it would be a step too far to send helmets to the Ukrainian armed forces.
Sahra Wagenknecht applies pressure
One reason for Scholz's dithering could be electoral pressure in eastern Germany from the from Bundnis Sahra Wagenknecht (BSW), a new left-wing party that could drain votes from traditional SPD supporters who are suspicious of German rearmament.
BSW's eponymous and charismatic leader broke away from the radical party Die Linke (The Left) because of its laissez-faire approach to immigration. Sahra Wagenknecht grew up in the communist German Democratic Republic (GDR) and has spoken nostalgically about the old East German regime. Die Linke itself emerged from the wreckage of the old Socialist Unity Party that controlled the GDR.
Likewise, the CDU risks losing votes to the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD), which wants friendlier relations with Russia, including the reinstatement of the controversial Nord Stream pipeline that until recently served Germany with Russian gas. Polls currently place the AfD second behind the CDU.
No blockage, promises Pistorius
For now, Germany remains Ukraine’s biggest military supporter in Europe. But Scholz’s see-sawing between full-throated support and denying what Kyiv asks for has often disappointed Kyiv.
"Any additional contribution” would be “welcome,” Ukraine's foreign minister, Andrij Sybiha, told German public broadcaster ARD on Monday.
Ukraine is under intense pressure from daily Russian attacks with hundreds of drones and dozens of missiles. Sybiha says the additional funds could be used to “create an air defence umbrella over Ukraine”.
German Defence Minister Boris Pistorius, who arrived for talks in Kyiv on Tuesday, rushed to defend Scholz.
There was no blockage, merely a “political decision” to make, he said.
"We have prepared a new aid package for Ukraine in the ministry of defence," Pistorius said. "As soon as all issues have been clarified, I expect a corresponding decision to be made."
