I dunno, it strikes me that Elon Musk’s politics are quite easily scrutable:

 Elon Musk made a surprise appearance during Germany’s AfD (Alternative fuer Deutschland) election campaign event in Halle in eastern Germany on Saturday, speaking publicly in support of the far right party for the second time in as many weeks.



Addressing a hall of 4,500 people alongside party leader Alice Weidel, Musk spoke live via video link about preserving German culture and protecting the German people.



“It’s good to be proud of German culture, German values, and not to lose that in some sort of multiculturalism that dilutes everything,” Musk said.



Last week, the U.S. billionaire caused uproar after he made a gesture that drew online comparisons to a Nazi salute during U.S. President Donald Trump’s inauguration festivities.



On Saturday, he said “children should not be guilty of the sins of their parents, let alone their great grandparents,” apparently referring to Germany’s Nazi past.



“There is too much focus on past guilt, and we need to move beyond that,” he said.

Anybody who doesn’t understand what these comments in this context mean doesn’t want to know.



In related news, it’s worth noting that banks are trying to bail out of their Twitter purchase debt, because the financing deal made no sense:

Banks are getting ready to sell billions of dollars in debt borrowed by Elon Musk’s X, bringing Wall Street a step closer to exiting the nerve-racking deal that financed the social-media company’s buyout.



Morgan Stanley bankers have reached out to investors ahead of a planned sale next week of up to $3 billion of debt the bank and others such as Bank of America and Barclays lent to complete Musk’s 2022 buyout of the company then known as Twitter, people familiar with the matter said. 



The banks hope to sell senior debt at 90-95 cents on the dollar, while retaining more-junior holdings, the people said. The banks just sold approximately $1 billion of debt in a private transaction to several investors, some of the people said.



The debt has been an albatross on the banks since they backed Musk’s $44 billion deal with around $13 billion in financing. The price Musk paid for Twitter was high, even at the time of his purchase, and the company’s rocky performance had knocked down the value. The deal is considered one of the worst that banks agreed to finance since the 2008 financial crisis.

One of the worst deals in history if the point is to make money on that particular investment, but once the reconciliation bill passes we will see that there were so major side benefits.
