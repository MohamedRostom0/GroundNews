A cake to the face was thrown at FDP leader Christian Lindner by a young woman, who was later revealed to be a member of the Left Party in Germany, during a campaign speech in the state of Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania.
In the circulated video, the former German Finance Minister is seen at the podium when the woman suddenly stands up, approaches him, and forcefully throws the plate with the cake at his face. Although initially startled, he moves to wipe his face and manages to “respond” by returning some of the cake to her. Meanwhile, attendees intervene and bring her to the ground.
He then attempted to make light of the situation, saying, “Unfortunately, it wasn’t cream, just whipped cream. At the very least, they could have done that better,” as he wiped his face with a napkin. “I wear these battle scars with pride,” Lindner added.
