				Due to a "rapid expansion of solar capacity," Germany generated 72.2 TWh of solar power in 2024, reports PV magazine, "accounting for 14% of its total electricity output, according to Germany's Fraunhofer Institute for Solar Energy Systems. 

"Wind power remained Germany's largest source of electricity in 2024, generating 136.4 TWh..."

Hydropower also saw a slight increase, contributing 21.7 TWh in 2024. Total renewable energy generation reached 275.2 TWh, up 4.4% from 2023. Biomass plants, with an installed capacity of 9.1 GW, generated 36 TWh of electricity. 

Generation from coal-fired power plants declined sharply in Germany in 2024, with lignite production dropping 8.4% and hard coal falling 27.6%, according to Energy Charts. Lignite-fired plants produced 71.1 TWh, roughly matching the total output from photovoltaic systems, while hard coal plants generated 24.2 TWh...  Germany's CO2 emissions continued their downward trend, falling to 152 million tons in 2024, a 58% reduction from 1990 levels and more than half of 2014 levels... 

Battery storage capacity saw substantial growth, with installed capacity rising from 8.6 GW to 12.1 GW and associated energy storage increasing from 12.7 GWh to 17.7 GWh. Germany's battery storage capacity now surpasses pumped storage by approximately 10 GW, underscoring the shift toward renewable energy integration.

They didn't do it. They dragged their feet because they didn't really think Putin would invade Ukraine and if he did they thought it would be over quickly and they could go back to buying cheap gas after sacrificing the people of Ukraine. Not really a smart long-term decision given that with climate change bearing down on everyone the rest of Europe needs Ukraine's wheat but Germany has become remarkably short-sighted as long as they can keep getting cheap gas and oil.  

The nuclear reactors were shut down because they didn't trust them in a post Fukushima world. I don't blame them. If you could keep the nuclear reactors being run publicly that would be fine but that's not politically tenable. Sooner or later somebody's going to privatize those things.  

So now Germany is playing catch up doing the renewable switch over They should have done ages ago.  

To be fair Germany wasn't just after cheap oil and gas They wanted to tie Russia up economically so that Russia would be less likely to do things like invade other countries. The problem is that doesn't work because they underestimated just how much control Putin has over his population. Russia's economy is a smoldering crater and their people are facing runaway inflation and still the war continues. It's been going so long their entire economy is now transitioned into a permanent wartime economy and they don't know what to do about that either. It's a complete fucking mess.  

The point being that since Russia just doesn't care how their people suffer you can't use that against them. You can't use those kind of economic entanglements

Thanks. Here is a better source https://www.berliner-zeitung.d... [berliner-zeitung.de] (Firefox can translate that for you).My take: of course you're right the EU does not have the power to cancel any election, and Breton isn't even in any position of power right now. Therefore when he says "we did it in Romania" (we annulled the Romanian presidential election), he means "we" in a generic sense ("we Europeans", not "we the powers of EU"), as in "we" he can only be a regular citizen, not a person of power.His implication isn't "if AfD wins", but "if Elon uses Twitter to influence the election", like an unidentified power (most likely Russia) used TikTok to manipulate the Romanian election. Breton implies there was backstage discussion that lead to the Romanian election being annulled. It is reasonable to expect that important decisions are discussed before decisions are made, so I'm not shocked that the Romanian leadership discussed the topic with EU counterparts.Now the thing is Elon used Twitter/X to support AfD in next German elections. (At least, contrary to the TikTok case, he does it in the clear.) It was said (chancellor Scholz) that Elon is in his right to give his opinions. Breton seems to be opposite opinion. My opinion is that if Elon gets an official position in the new US administration, his words might start to be considered interference from a foreign power. Romania suspended TikTok on that ground, maybe we can get a combo with Twitter in Germany.

The chart shows that electricity generation has climbed steadily since the gas shutoff from Russia and now exceeds 2020 production."Energy Charts noted that Germany has sufficient capacity to produce and export electricity during winter, unlike Austria, Switzerland, and France, which face seasonal shortfalls."

Indeed, France in particular is an interesting example. Their nuclear plants can't handle the summer heat, and can't meet winter demand. They were reliant on neighbours to keep the lights on, which is fine within the EU, but it does lead to very expensive electricity when they have excess and renewables in Spain are exporting for pennies.

The price of electricity in Germany has been somewhat higher than most of the EU for more than 10 years, and it still tracks with the rest of the EU. There has been a spike in cost recently as a result of the Ukraine war.

The price of electricity in Germany has been somewhat higher than most of the EU for more than 10 years, and it still tracks with the rest of the EU. The prices for electricity, and all energy more generally, will track across the EU because there's plenty of trade among the nations of the EU.  What I wonder is if Germany's energy policies are driving up prices.  I may have found my answer in the fine article. Electricity prices on the exchange surged in November and December, making fossil fuel power plants more profitable and reducing imports. There has been a spike in cost recently as a result of the Ukraine war. The price actually dropped some last year and maybe that is due to the renewables being cheaper than fossil.My guess is the price drop was from improved ability to ship in LNG from Canada, USA, and other nations.
