The far-right party’s candidate for chancellor, Alice Weidel, tries to woo voters with her extreme views.
Since its founding in 2013, the Alternative for Germany (AfD) party has become a major political force in Germany.
The far-right party is polling second ahead of a general election next month.
The party’s candidate for chancellor, Alice Weidel, is calling for a tough policy on immigrants.
Her manifesto also includes Germany leaving the euro and reversing its decision to abandon nuclear power.
Could Weidel’s views strike a chord with voters and enable the AfD to become an important player in German politics?
