Emmanuel Macron has added his voice to a growing chorus of European criticism of Elon Musk, accusing the world‚Äôs richest man of intervening directly in the continent‚Äôs democratic processes, including Germany‚Äôs snap federal elections next month. The French president joined the Norwegian and British prime ministers and a German government spokesperson on Monday in responding to a barrage of hostile posts by Musk backing far-right political parties and attacking leftwing politicians in Europe. The owner of the social media platform X is a close ally of Donald Trump and, after spending more than $250m (¬£210m) to help get him re-elected, has been asked by the incoming US president to cut the federal budget as a special adviser. ‚ÄúTen years ago, who would have imagined that the owner of one of the world‚Äôs largest social networks would be supporting a new international reactionary movement and intervening directly in elections, including in Germany,‚Äù Macron said. In a speech to French ambassadors, the French president, who has previously cultivated a constructive relationship with Musk, most recently inviting him to the reopening of Notre Dame cathedral, refrained from mentioning the billionaire by name ‚Äì as did Norway‚Äôs centre-left prime minister, Jonas Gahr St√∏re. There was no doubt, however, who either leader was talking about. ‚ÄúI find it worrying that a man with enormous access to social media and huge economic resources involves himself so directly in the internal affairs of other countries,‚Äù St√∏re told public broadcaster NRK. ‚ÄúThis is not the way things should be between democracies and allies.‚Äù In response to a question about what would happen were Musk to involve himself directly in Norwegian politics, St√∏re added that he hoped the country‚Äôs politicians ‚Äì who face a general election in September ‚Äì ‚Äúwould warn against, and distance themselves from, such efforts‚Äù.

    Re: "After Elon Musk spent more than $250m to help get Trump re-elected..." Slightly off topic... Can voters donate the maximum individual contribution ($3,300 max in the general election) to the Presidential nominee AND to the Vice President nominee? I know huge $250m donations are a completely different category and set of rules.

‚ÄúTen years ago, who would have imagined that the owner of one of the world‚Äôs largest social networks would be supporting a new international reactionary movement and intervening directly in elections, including in Germany,‚Äù Macron said. In a speech to French ambassadors, the French president, who has previously cultivated a constructive relationship with Musk, most recently inviting him to the reopening of Notre Dame cathedral, refrained from mentioning the billionaire by name ‚Äì as did Norway‚Äôs centre-left prime minister, Jonas Gahr St√∏re. There was no doubt, however, who either leader was talking about. ‚ÄúI find it worrying that a man with enormous access to social media and huge economic resources involves himself so directly in the internal affairs of other countries,‚Äù St√∏re told public broadcaster NRK. ‚ÄúThis is not the way things should be between democracies and allies.‚Äù In response to a question about what would happen were Musk to involve himself directly in Norwegian politics, St√∏re added that he hoped the country‚Äôs politicians ‚Äì who face a general election in September ‚Äì ‚Äúwould warn against, and distance themselves from, such efforts‚Äù.

    Re: "After Elon Musk spent more than $250m to help get Trump re-elected..." Slightly off topic... Can voters donate the maximum individual contribution ($3,300 max in the general election) to the Presidential nominee AND to the Vice President nominee? I know huge $250m donations are a completely different category and set of rules.

    Re: "After Elon Musk spent more than $250m to help get Trump re-elected..." Slightly off topic... Can voters donate the maximum individual contribution ($3,300 max in the general election) to the Presidential nominee AND to the Vice President nominee? I know huge $250m donations are a completely different category and set of rules.
