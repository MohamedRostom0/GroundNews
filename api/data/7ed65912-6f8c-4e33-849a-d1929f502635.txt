  What to KnowMusk has expressed support on X for the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) party and its leader, Alice Weidel. He also published an opinion piece in the German newspaper Welt am Sonntag endorsing the party. Eva Marie Kogel, the paper's opinion editor, resigned in protest.On Thursday, Musk participated in a livestream on X with Weidel, where he encouraged voters to support the anti-immigration AfD in Germany's February elections.The administration of Germany's lower house of parliament, the Bundestag, is investigating whether Musk's support for the AfD on the platform where he has 210 million followers could constitute an illegal party donation.Under German law, campaigning by third parties is considered a party donation. LobbyControl, a non-governmental advocacy group promoting transparency and democracy, suggested on Wednesday that Musk's online discussion with Weidel might amount to such a donation.Damian Boeselager, a German member of the European Parliament, has called on the European Commission to look into Musk's alleged "interference" in Germany's and other European elections. Boeselager outlined his concerns in a January 4 letter to Henna Maria Virkkunen, executive vice president of the European Commission for Technological Sovereignty, Security and Democracy.Musk has also targeted Britain's Labour government and Prime Minister Keir Starmer. He accused Starmer of failing to prosecute child grooming gangs in northern England during his tenure as director of public prosecutions from 2008 to 2013. Starmer responded by warning against "those who are spreading lies and misinformation."On Thursday, The Financial Times, citing unnamed sources, reported that Musk is exploring ways to remove Starmer before the U.K.'s next election and replace the current center-left government with a right-wing party.Musk has shown support for the right-wing party Reform UK but has suggested that its leader, key Brexit campaigner Nigel Farage, be replaced.On Monday, French President Emmanuel Macron criticized Musk's attempts to "intervene directly in elections," including those in Germany.During a Wednesday interview with France Inter radio, French Foreign Minister Jean-Noël Barrot urged the European Commission to protect member states from election interference "with the greatest firmness" when asked about Musk.What People Are SayingA Bundestag spokesman told Die Welt regarding the investigation into Musk: "In this case, the facts are currently being clarified."Elon Musk, posting on X on January 8: "First, the EU tried to stop me from having an online conversation with President Donald Trump. Now, they want to prevent people from hearing a conversation with Alice Weidel, who might be the next chancellor of Germany. These guys really hate democracy!"Damian Boeselager in his January 4 letter to Henna Maria Virkkunen: "Many German and European citizens are increasingly concerned about the concentration of economic and political power in the hands of Elon Musk—especially since he seems to have no moral or other inhibitions about using his power to influence elections. Given that he is voicing election recommendations within Germany, would you constitute this as a serious risk of foreign interference?"French President Emmanuel Macron in a January 6 speech to French ambassadors: "Ten years ago, who could have imagined that the owner of one of the largest social networks in the world would support a new international reactionary movement and intervene directly in elections, including in Germany?"French Foreign Minister Jean-Noël Barrot on France Inter radio Wednesday: "Either the European Commission applies with the greatest firmness the laws we have given ourselves to protect our public space, or it does not, and then it must agree to give back that capacity to the EU member states. We have to wake up."What Happens NextGermany's February election will determine the makeup of the Bundestag and potentially a new chancellor for the country.Polls suggest the Social Democrats (SPD), the party of incumbent Chancellor Olaf Scholz, will win the most votes, with the AfD potentially securing the second-highest total.
