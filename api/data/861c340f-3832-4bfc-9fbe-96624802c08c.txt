The German parliament is debating a motion of no confidence in the government.
The German Chancellor, Olaf Scholz, faces a confidence vote in parliament after his coalition collapsed. But his party thinks it can defy the odds and win another election soon.
Also on the programme: French ministers arrive in the Indian Ocean territory of Mayotte, two days after it was hit by a cyclone that is thought to have killed hundreds; and archaeologists say they have evidence that some Bronze Age Britons were cannibals who ate their enemies.
