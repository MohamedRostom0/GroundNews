Concrete plans are under way for an online meeting between US billionaire Elon Musk and the leader of the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD), Alice Weidel, her spokesman said on Tuesday.
"We are already in contact about an X Space between the two," spokesman Daniel Tapp told Spiegel magazine and dpa. Spaces is a feature to enable live broadcasts of conversations on Musk's platform X.
South African-born Musk, who is known for posting provocative messages on his platform, has been provoking debate in German politics, as the country prepares for elections on February 23.
Over the weekend, he once again promoted the AfD in an opinion column for the Welt am Sonntag newspaper which has sparked widespread discussion and criticism.
"Wait until Alice and I do an X Spaces conversation. They will lose their minds," Musk wrote on Monday in response to an influencer close to the AfD.
Weidel previously thanked Musk for his support in a video on X.
So far, there has been no personal phone call or meeting between Weidel and Musk. "But that will surely change soon," said the AfD spokesman.
