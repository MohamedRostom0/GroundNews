In response to the warning from Friedrich Merz, German Christian Democratic candidate for chancellor, who warned of "great risks" for companies investing in China, Mao Ning, spokesperson from China's Foreign Ministry, said Germany should objectively and rationally view China's development, uphold the tradition of China-Germany friendship, recognize the mutually beneficial nature of China-Germany cooperation, and do more that align with the interests of both countries and peoples.
Merz, whose party is currently leading in the polls for next month's elections, stated "I say to all representatives of the German economy that the decision to invest in China is a decision involving great risk," after a policy speech in which he advocated for Berlin to take a more active role on the global stage, according to Financial Times.
In response, Mao stated during Friday's press briefing that China and Germany are comprehensive strategic partners. Over the past 53 years since the establishment of diplomatic relations, the two countries have developed bilateral relations based on the principles of mutual respect, seeking common ground while reserving differences, mutual learning, and win-win cooperation. This has fostered a story of pragmatic cooperation that has delivered tangible benefits to the people of both countries.
Mao further stated that China hopes Germany to objectively and rationally view China's development, uphold the tradition of China-Germany friendship, recognize the mutually beneficial nature of China-Germany cooperation, and do more that align with the interests of both countries and peoples.
We also welcome German politicians to come to China, take a look, and experience the real China, as well as the vitality and dynamism of China in the new era, said Mao.
