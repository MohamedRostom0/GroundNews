Thousands of Germans on Saturday protested in Berlin and other cities against the rise of the far-right and anti-immigrant Alternative for Germany (AfD) party ahead of a Feb. 23 general election.
At Berlin's Brandenburg Gate, participants lighted up their phones, blew whistles and sang anti-fascist songs, and in Cologne, protesters carried banners denouncing AfD.
An opposition bloc of Germany’s center-right parties, the Union, led by Friedrich Merz, is leading pre-election polls with AfD in second place.
Merz said Friday that his party will bring motions to toughen migration policy — one of the main election issues — to parliament next week, a move seen risky in case the motions go to a vote and pass with the help of AfD.
Merz had earlier vowed to bar people from entering the country without proper papers and to step up deportations if he is elected chancellor. Those comments came after a knife attack in Aschaffenburg by a rejected asylum-seeker left a man and a 2-year-old boy dead and spilled over into the election campaign.
Activists including the group calling itself Fridays for Future dubbed the Berlin rally the “sea of light against the right turn.” They hope it will draw attention to the actions by the new administration of U.S. President Donald Trump and to the political lineup ahead of Germany’s election.
A protester in Cologne, Thomas Schneemann, said it was most important for him to ”stay united against the far right."
"Especially after yesterday and what we heard from Friedrich Merz we have to stand together to fight the far right,” Schneemann said.
The protests took place place while AfD was opening its election campaign in the central city of Halle on Saturday. Party leaders Alice Weidel, AfD's candidate for chancellor, and Tino Chrupalla were expected to speak to an audience of some 4,500 people.
Weidel again received the backing of Elon Musk, who addressed the rally remotely, but she has no realistic chance of becoming Germany’s leader as other parties refuse to work with AfD.

“Wiesel again received the backing of Elon Musk, who addressed the rally remotely”
I think he should attend a rally in person and thank them ‘from the heart’.
The silent majority don’t express their views with placards and loud speakers demanding this and that.
The silent majority expresses their view peacefully and quietly at the ballot box.
U.S.A. , Hungary, Austria, Slovakia, Croatia, Italy, Argentina, El Salvador have all risen up in defiance of Globalism.
Germany, the Czech Republic, Germany and the UK are next.
The Davos elite are panicking.

Now that was a mic drop!!! Absolutely!

All 4?
Germany, the Czech Republic, Germany and the UK are next.
The Labour Party won the UK General Election last year.

And the conservatives aren't getting back in any time soon.
The only threat from the right comes from Reform, as the world's most famous fascist bank-roller is backing them. However, they're not in the kind of league which plays seriously at the general election level.
Germany, the Czech Republic, Germany and the UK are next.
All 4?
Probably pining for the days of East and West.
Little comparisons between Czech Republic, Germany and the UK.

The voting system
https://www.bmi.bund.de/EN/topics/constitution/electoral-law/voting-system/voting-system-node.html
The German system focuses on a system of proportional representation, more over it must be stressed heavily biased towards a overwhelming need to form alliances, coalition ruling governments.
AfD Party leader Alice Weidel, will have to lobby persuade a right of centre party to form and coalition.
Alice Weidel should have been smart and given Elon Musk a wide berth.
That crowd don't look too big in the photo. Hundreds more like than thousands.

The very first sentence of the article:

If you’re going to criticize something make sure you have a valid point first. Just looks stupid otherwise.
Germany, the Czech Republic, Germany and the UK are next.
All 4?
You're right, it's 5, I forgot to add Canada.
Klaus Schwab's little socialist pet, Justin Trudeau is getting booted out.
Canadians are sick of Globalist Woke policies.
Germany counts as two biggest it's gonna be a big win for the resistance. It's Klaus Schwab's home country and they're going to reject the WEF Davos billionaire agenda.
commies to the left of me, fascists to the right, here i am stuck in the middle again..
The AfD are the true defenders of real Germans. The last chance to save the soul and culture of the nation.

They are the German UKip and have had the same level of success. 11 years of nothing much. Last chance? They’ll reform as something else and same as UKip line their pockets with gammon money.
The AfD are an extreme right-wing party based on Nazism and they have been prosecuted.
The UKip is a right-wing nationalist group more tame than the German AfD.
The AfD are an extreme right-wing party based on Nazism and they have been prosecuted.
Not based on Nazism, stop trying to spread the usual anti AfD propaganda.
Certainly to the right of center on many issues but some of their social welfare agenda is far left..

The leader of the AfD was prosecuted for Nazism.
A prominent far-right German politician has been found guilty of knowingly using a Nazi slogan in a speech.

Founded in 2013 as an anti-European Union party, AfD has since radicalized and become an extremist, anti-immigrant party whose aim is “to eliminate the free democratic basic order,” according to a 2023 report by the German Institute for Human Rights.

So do you trust Google big tech or not?
The AfD is not anti immigrant. They are quite rightly anti illegal immigrant and want immigrants who fit into German culture and follow German law. It would be true to say they see Islam as a negative influence for their country. A view increasing shared by many in Europe.
Elon Musk appears to reference Nazis again as he makes a surprise appearance at a rally of the German right-wing party AfD.
Elon Musk tells Germany's radical far-right AfD party there's too much 'guilt' over the 'sins' of Nazi grandparents.
I hear that they had to tie Elon's hands together to prevent him from him doing his special 'wave' to them.
