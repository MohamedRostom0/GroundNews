German Chancellor Olaf Scholz amped up on criticism of U.S. President-elect Donald Trump over the integrity of borders during an animated speech meant to motivate Social Democrats ahead of a federal election next month.Scholz’s main competitors to lead Germany, Friedrich Merz and Alice Weidel, also spoke on Saturday at meetings of their respective parties as campaigning gains steam.In power since 2021 as the senior member of a now-defunct three-party coalition, support for Scholz’s SPD has slumped as an early election looms for Europe’s largest economy on Feb. 23.
