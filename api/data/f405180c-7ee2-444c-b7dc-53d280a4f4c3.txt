Planned protests organized by an alliance of activists have begun ahead of the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) two-day party conference, which kicks off Saturday morning in the eastern German town of Riesa in Saxony.
Three of Germany's major parties are holding gatherings on Saturday to firm up their programmes and candidates ahead of the nationwide elections on February 23, following the collapse of Chancellor Olaf Scholz's three-party coalition.
Organizers expect more than 10,000 people to attend demonstrations against the AfD. Participants from about 70 cities are due to arrive in more than 100 buses, they said.
A "small group" was said to be blocking the eastbound lane of a nearby highway.
Demonstrators also planned to block the access routes and entrances to the conference venue where the AfD rally is to be held.
While the situation remained calm in the morning, authorities anticipate the presence of violent protesters and have established a control zone within the town, located some 130 kilometres south of Berlin.
Counter-demonstrators were being directed to the indicated assembly points, the police said.
The police operation will be coordinated with a helicopter over the city area, it was reported. The police are also using drones and are being supported by forces from several federal states.
The AfD intends to adopt its election manifesto in Riesa and officially nominate party leader Alice Weidel as its chancellor candidate.
Saxony is one of the AfD's strongholds: in the last election, it won 24.6 % of the vote there, leaving the Christian Democratic Union (CDU), the traditional party of Germanyâ€™s conservatives, far behind with 17.2 %.
