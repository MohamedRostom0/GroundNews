The German-language Stuttgarter Zeitung reported that the first six RCH 155 wheeled self-propelled howitzers (SPHs) have been handed over to the Ukrainian military at Rheinmetall’s plant in Kassel. The initial half-dozen vehicles will be employed to train Ukrainian military personnel on the German-made SPH. 

Berlin has pledged to provide fifty-four RCH 155 SPHs to Kyiv, but the timeline on when the remaining vehicles could reach Ukraine and then the frontline is unclear.
“Ukraine, and that is the signal, can count on us. And Germany is ready to assume responsibility in Europe,” German defense minister Boris Pistorius said during a ceremony at the Kassel facility where the vehicles are produced. 

Kyiv had first announced plans to purchase eighteen of the weapon systems in 2022, while the order was increased to thirty-six before being expanded to fifty-four. “Due to production delays at Rheinmetall, the first deliveries were postponed. Additionally, the United Kingdom has also placed orders for the RCH 155,” United24Media reported, adding, “The RCH 155 will be deployed as part of both Ukrainian and German artillery forces.”
In accepting the delivery of the half-dozen SPHs, Ukrainian ambassador Oleksii Makeiev praised the aid from Germany.


“We don’t need mediators, we need allies,” said the ambassador with a view to possible negotiations on ending the war. Peace must be fought for. It is good to know that Germany is on Ukraine’s side.”
The RCH 155 in the Crosshairs
Development of the RCH 155 (Remote Controlled Howitzer 155mm) began in 2014, and production on the first vehicles started up in 2022. According to the platform’s developer, Krauss-Maffei Wegmann (KNDS Deutschland), the RCH 155 was designed to combine “the firepower and range of the automatic and remote-controllable Artillery Gun Module (AGM) with the protection and mobility of the field-tested BOXER wheeled armoured vehicle.”
It is armed with a 155mm/L52 main gun, which is mounted to an 8×8 wheeled armored BOXER chassis. Unlike other self-propelled howitzers, which must stop to fire, the RCH 155 is capable of firing while on the move, enhancing its flexibility.
The turret is remotely operated, resulting in a reduction in crew to just a commander and driver, yet it is still able to fire nine rounds per minute—providing “multiple round simultaneous impact” (MRSI) capability. The main gun, which is equipped with an autoloader, has a range of up to 40 km (25 miles) with base bleed (base burn) ordnance, and up to 54 km (33.5 miles) with Velocity Enhanced Long-Range Artillery Projectile (V-LAP) rounds. Even longer ranges are reported to be possible depending on the ammunition employed. The RCH 155 can carry thirty primed projectiles or up to 144 modular charges. The main gun has an elevation that ranges from -2.5 to +65 degrees, which—unusual for an SPH—allows it to employ the main gun as a direct-fire weapon to engage other vehicles in its “hunter-killer” mode.


It is powered by an MTU 8V199 TE21 engine that provides upwards of 816 hp (600 kW). It has an operational range of 700 km (400 miles) on the road and can reach a top speed of 103 km/h (60 mph).
The vehicle’s turret is made of lightweight aluminum armor, which reduces its weight but still offers protection from small arms fire—up to 7.62mm calibers—as well as from artillery shell splinters. The front of the hull can also withstand fire from Russian 30x165mm armor-piercing rounds.

The turret is remotely operated, resulting in a reduction in crew to just a commander and driver, yet it is still able to fire nine rounds per minute—providing “multiple round simultaneous impact” (MRSI) capability. The main gun, which is equipped with an autoloader, has a range of up to 40 km (25 miles) with base bleed (base burn) ordnance, and up to 54 km (33.5 miles) with Velocity Enhanced Long-Range Artillery Projectile (V-LAP) rounds. Even longer ranges are reported to be possible depending on the ammunition employed. The RCH 155 can carry thirty primed projectiles or up to 144 modular charges. The main gun has an elevation that ranges from -2.5 to +65 degrees, which—unusual for an SPH—allows it to employ the main gun as a direct-fire weapon to engage other vehicles in its “hunter-killer” mode.


It is powered by an MTU 8V199 TE21 engine that provides upwards of 816 hp (600 kW). It has an operational range of 700 km (400 miles) on the road and can reach a top speed of 103 km/h (60 mph).
The vehicle’s turret is made of lightweight aluminum armor, which reduces its weight but still offers protection from small arms fire—up to 7.62mm calibers—as well as from artillery shell splinters. The front of the hull can also withstand fire from Russian 30x165mm armor-piercing rounds.
