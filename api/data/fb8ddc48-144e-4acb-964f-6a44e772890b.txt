Elon Musk is the last hope for European citizens. Europe’s nations teeter on the brink of socialist autocracy, even as they accuse Musk of being an existential threat to “democracy” in Europe. Across Europe, increasingly totalitarian European governments are desperate to destroy Musk, whom they say (echoing Democrats at home) threatens democracy: Zlatti71 @Zlatti_71 🇩🇪Scholz called Musk a threat to democracy in Europe. Speaking at a press conference in Berlin, the German chancellor accused the businessman of supporting far-right parties in the EU: "This endangers the democratic development of Europe, it endangers our community and must be criticised." Earlier, Musk supported the German opposition party AfG, saying that only it could save Germany. As a reminder, parliamentary elections will be held in Germany on 23 February. Scholz is taking part in them. "Alternative for Germany nominated Alice Weidel. Orwell must be spinning in his grave at this perversion of reality. All that Musk is doing is allowing the people of Europe to access information and opinions, as well as to talk amongst themselves. Freedom of speech has always been the single most important foundation of democracy and the greatest bulwark against tyranny. No need to believe me. Take it from John Milton, the man who penned Areopagitica, perhaps the most powerful political argument for freedom of speech in 1644, at the height of England’s civil war. And that is why Europe needs Musk. It is a story in several parts. First, Europe is failing economically. It used to be vibrant, at least while the US government largely underwrote their defense costs.

Europeans need to vote or fight their way out of marxism. Elon can help, but it is the fight for Europeans to win or they don’t deserve freedom.

“First, Europe is failing economically. It used to be vibrant, at least while the US government largely underwrote their defense costs. In 2010, the GDP of the EU equaled that of the United States. However, that is drying up with Trump forcing the EU nations to pay their way in NATO. Moreover, the EU nations are cutting their own throats with utopian energy policies. It is stunning but in no way surprising then, that the GDP of the EU has decreased in 15 years to half that of the U.S.”
I had no idea. That is huge. If we had real journalists, this would be front page news.
I imagine that you was trying to hush this up, just as their leaders are performing criminal acts just stay in power. Deja vu. Maybe they can follow our lead, with musk’s help.

Europeans need to vote or fight their way out of marxism. Elon can help, but it is the fight for Europeans to win or they don’t deserve freedom.

Refuse to submit to your Deep State.Which is why they're making an example of Tommy Robinson. So the peasants will know they have to submit to their Lords.

“First, Europe is failing economically. It used to be vibrant, at least while the US government largely underwrote their defense costs. In 2010, the GDP of the EU equaled that of the United States. However, that is drying up with Trump forcing the EU nations to pay their way in NATO. Moreover, the EU nations are cutting their own throats with utopian energy policies. It is stunning but in no way surprising then, that the GDP of the EU has decreased in 15 years to half that of the U.S.”
I had no idea. That is huge. If we had real journalists, this would be front page news.
I imagine that you was trying to hush this up, just as their leaders are performing criminal acts just stay in power. Deja vu. Maybe they can follow our lead, with musk’s help.

Orwell must be spinning in his grave at this perversion of reality. All that Musk is doing is allowing the people of Europe to access information and opinions, as well as to talk amongst themselves. Freedom of speech has always been the single most important foundation of democracy and the greatest bulwark against tyranny. No need to believe me. Take it from John Milton, the man who penned Areopagitica, perhaps the most powerful political argument for freedom of speech in 1644, at the height of England’s civil war. And that is why Europe needs Musk. It is a story in several parts. First, Europe is failing economically. It used to be vibrant, at least while the US government largely underwrote their defense costs.
