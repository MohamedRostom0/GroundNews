‘Today it’s cool to hang far-right slogans in your bedroom’
Olaf Scholz’s lame-duck coalition faces the voters in parliamentary elections next month. It does so after a year in which the far-right AfD made striking electoral gains, most worryingly among the young.
Last year was a good one for the AfD (Alternative für Deutschland). The far-right party, formed in 2013, won 15.9% of the vote in June’s EU election, becoming Germany’s biggest party after the CDU (Christian Democratic Union, 30%). If that seemed impressive, September elections in three eastern states (Länder) sent shockwaves through the traditional parties: the AfD amassed 29.2% in Brandenburg – where the SDP (Social Democratic Party) squeaked in with 30.9% – and 30.6% in Saxony, just behind the CDU (31.9%). And it took first place in Thuringia (32.8%). This means a far-right party now holds the majority in a German state parliament, something not seen since the second world war. Though a united firewall will prevent it from governing there, it will have a blocking minority that local leader Björn Höcke won’t be shy about using.
Even more concerning, the AfD scored higher with 18-24-year-olds than among the general population in the 2024 local elections (31% in both Saxony and Brandenburg, 38% in Thuringia), which is particularly striking given its radical calls for largescale ‘remigration’ (removal of immigrants). In June’s European election, 16% of Germans aged 16-24 chose the AfD, just behind the CDU on 17%. The Greens plummeted to 11% – a far cry from their 33% in 2019, at the height of the Fridays for Future climate movement – paying the price for their failures and broken promises as part of the Olaf Scholz coalition.
Why do East German youth no longer vote red or green, but blue? First, the AfD has an effective youth organisation, Junge Alternative für Deutschland (JA), geared to 14-35-year-olds. Legal independence from its parent has allowed the group to adopt more extreme positions and rhetoric: in 2023 the Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution classified it a ‘certified rightwing extremist endeavour’. Wanting to reassure voters before the 23 February snap parliamentary election, the AfD has cut ties with the JA and announced (...)
