            "title": "German politics stall DB's punctuality drive",
            "summary": "Deutsche Bahn (DB) is undertaking a comprehensive reconstruction plan to improve its notoriously unreliable rail service, with 40 major projects aimed at enhancing punctuality and capacity. However, political instability in Germany, following the collapse of the government coalition, threatens funding and progress, as a national budget is uncertain. The government had allocated \u20ac30 billion-\u20ac50 billion for this initiative over three years, but delays are likely. Despite the challenges, train driver Tyler Bosselman remains optimistic about the future of DB, which he views as critical infrastructure, and is pursuing further education to contribute to its transformation.",
            "content": "Deutsche Bahn is investing big in addressing public perceptions of the German national rail carrier as hugely dysfunctional. But political disarray in Berlin has knocked it off track.\nTyler Bosselman was wearing the\u00a0dark blue vest and\u00a0the red tie of a\u00a0Deutsche Bahntrain driver. As he sat comfortably in the operator's seat\u00a0of his regional DB train, the\u00a0landscapes of southern Germany rushed by outside, reflected\u00a0in\u00a0his sunglasses.\nConstruction is underway on one of the routes that the 24-year-old Bosselman drives. It's the busy Riedbahn route between Frankfurt and Mannheim in Germany, which is getting new switches and signals to make rail traffic run more smoothly. The goal is to finish the overhaul by the end of December, and Bosselman hopes that the upgrade will make Deutsche Bahn \"more reliable overall.\"\nReconstruction of the Riedbahn route marks the beginning of what Germany's state-owned railway operator touted as a reboot of the company, with routes to Hanover, Hamburg and other busy sections of its nationwide network set to follow soon.\nDB's so-called comprehensive reconstruction\u00a0plan involves a total of 40 major construction projects\u00a0and aims to ensure that the operator's infamously unpunctual trains will be running on time again by the end of\u00a0the decade. At the program's launch this summer, German Transportation Minister Volker Wissing called it Germany's \"largest reconstruction\u00a0and modernization program in recent decades.\"\nDB's\u00a0plans could soon come to\u00a0a screeching halt. The collapse of the three-party German government coalition on November 6, and fresh elections to be held on February 23 next year at the earliest, mean the country is stuck in political limbo for half a year, and so is funding for the rail program.\nMartin Burkert, chairman of the EVG rail workers union, has already warned that, without a 2025 national budget, there would be a lack of money to carry on with the projects. \"Years of planning work to finally get the infrastructure up to date and improve the punctuality and capacity of the network is now at risk,\" Burkert told the German news agency, dpa, recently.\nBosselman knows all too well how necessary the overhaul of DB's rail network\u00a0is. Every day, the train driver navigates his engine through a web of construction sites in and around the Frankfurt rail hub. \"It's like when you are going to a casino. It's like you're gambling and hoping that you are on time. During rush hours, there is absolutely no guarantee that you are getting there in any reasonable time,\" Bosselman told DW.\nAn active union member, Bosselman can share many stories about what goes wrong at DB. While most regional trains still manage to be fairly punctual, he says, almost one in three long-distance trains in Germany now arrives late. Yet they are usually given priority on the crowded tracks thus holding up slower trains or idling them on sidetracks until they pass by. \"It doesn't matter if it is on a Monday, a Wednesday or any other day in the week. You can basically mark the day in your calendar that you make it into Frankfurt central station without having to slow down once.\"\nDB's infrastructure backlog is not only evident in the carrier's\u00a0lack of punctuality, but has also increasingly manifested itself in a thinned-out network that has been shrinking for years. Surprisingly, this has happened against the backdrop of rising demand for its services, with goods volumes and passenger numbers having increased at the same time.\nBosselman said you could see the ruins left by a chronically underfunded rail company every day. As we pass a steel bridge, he points\u00a0to rusty, moss-covered tracks nearby, which he says have been disused for a long time. \"You could have a much higher volume of traffic here, if you invested a few euros into this replacement track.\"\nAt the end of the 1990s, Germany was hit by a severe economic crisis, with the government cutting spending wherever possible. Deutsche Bahn, which is fully owned by the state, became an easy target for the cuts leading to a dramatic decline of investment in rail infrastructure.\nAlthough this has changed in recent years, the government still spends comparatively little money on Germany's railway infrastructure. According to the Pro-Rail Alliance \u2014 a lobby group that unites nonprofit pro-rail campaigners with railway sector companies \u2014 Germany spends about \u20ac115 ($121) per capita on its railways\u00a0annually, while countries such as Austria or Switzerland invest three to four times as much.\nTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video\nThe Federal Court of Auditors \u2014 an independent body that audits the federal budget and oversees the management of public funds\u00a0\u2014 highlighted the years of neglect and current underfunding in a recent report. It declared Deutsche Bahn a \"case for restructuring,\" and lambasted the government for having \"failed to address key rail policy questions for three decades.\"\nThe comprehensive reconstruction plan was supposed to be the answer to many of DB's woes, with the government earmarking \u20ac30 billion-\u20ac50 billion for\u00a0the endeavor over the next three years. But now, after the collapse of the government, Germany has no budget for the next year which could threaten the funding for some of the rail projects.\nChristian B\u00f6ttger, a professor at\u00a0the Berlin University of Applied Sciences for Technology and Economics whose research areas include railroads, said he believed that DB would get the money one day, but only after a new government has been formed. \"A cancellation by a new government seems politically very unlikely to me, but even the already imminent postponement of construction projects is, of course, a disaster,\" he told DW.\nBosselman is not too worried about deep cuts to railway funding in the future. He said politicians had realized that DB is part of Germany's \"critical infrastructure.\" However,\u00a0he believes that the current budget shortfalls will come at the expense of DB's\u00a0reboot. \"In Germany, roads have always taken precedence over rail, and that's why I feel that cuts to rail are more likely.\"\nBosselman intends to stay positive, as he believes that there's already \"a lot of negativity\u00a0going around\" in German politics. \"If you kind of give in to all that negativity, your life won't be too positive down the road,\" he said. \"I can't see myself sad or disappointed in everything,\" he added. \"There is always something to look up for.\"\nSo, instead of complaining about his employer, he aims to boost his career at the end of the year\u00a0with a master's degree in railway operations, which, he said, could be a \"door-opener to a leadership role\" so that he can try to \"transform Deutsche Bahn from the inside.\"\nAnd some German passengers, though small in numbers, also have a reason for hope regarding improvements in\u00a0rail services. DB announced a few weeks ago that the reconstruction of the Riedbahn would soon be completed, with service on the route scheduled to resume by mid-December \u2014 surprisingly for the rail operator, this would be right on schedule and just in time to complete the first project of the reconstruction plan ahead of the country's fresh elections.\nThis article was originally written in German.\nEditor's note:\u00a0An earlier version of this article incorrectly stated that the German ruling coalition collapsed on November 4. It has been corrected to state that the coalition collapsed on November 6.\nWhile you're here: Every Tuesday, DW editors round up what is happening in German politics and society.

But political disarray in Berlin has knocked it off track.\nTyler Bosselman was wearing the\u00a0dark blue vest and\u00a0the red tie of a\u00a0Deutsche Bahntrain driver. As he sat comfortably in the operator's seat\u00a0of his regional DB train, the\u00a0landscapes of southern Germany rushed by outside, reflected\u00a0in\u00a0his sunglasses.\nConstruction is underway on one of the routes that the 24-year-old Bosselman drives. It's the busy Riedbahn route between Frankfurt and Mannheim in Germany, which is getting new switches and signals to make rail traffic run more smoothly. The goal is to finish the overhaul by the end of December, and Bosselman hopes that the upgrade will make Deutsche Bahn \"more reliable overall.\"\nReconstruction of the Riedbahn route marks the beginning of what Germany's state-owned railway operator touted as a reboot of the company, with routes to Hanover, Hamburg and other busy sections of its nationwide network set to follow soon.\nDB's so-called comprehensive reconstruction\u00a0plan involves a total of 40 major construction projects\u00a0and aims to ensure that the operator's infamously unpunctual trains will be running on time again by the end of\u00a0the decade. At the program's launch this summer, German Transportation Minister Volker Wissing called it Germany's \"largest reconstruction\u00a0and modernization program in recent decades.\"\nDB's\u00a0plans could soon come to\u00a0a screeching halt. The collapse of the three-party German government coalition on November 6, and fresh elections to be held on February 23 next year at the earliest, mean the country is stuck in political limbo for half a year, and so is funding for the rail program.\nMartin Burkert, chairman of the EVG rail workers union, has already warned that, without a 2025 national budget, there would be a lack of money to carry on with the projects. \"Years of planning work to finally get the infrastructure up to date and improve the punctuality and capacity of the network is now at risk,\" Burkert told the German news agency, dpa, recently.\nBosselman knows all too well how necessary the overhaul of DB's rail network\u00a0is. Every day, the train driver navigates his engine through a web of construction sites in and around the Frankfurt rail hub. \"It's like when you are going to a casino. It's like you're gambling and hoping that you are on time. During rush hours, there is absolutely no guarantee that you are getting there in any reasonable time,\" Bosselman told DW.\nAn active union member, Bosselman can share many stories about what goes wrong at DB. While most regional trains still manage to be fairly punctual, he says, almost one in three long-distance trains in Germany now arrives late. Yet they are usually given priority on the crowded tracks thus holding up slower trains or idling them on sidetracks until they pass by. \"It doesn't matter if it is on a Monday, a Wednesday or any other day in the week. You can basically mark the day in your calendar that you make it into Frankfurt central station without having to slow down once.\"\nDB's infrastructure backlog is not only evident in the carrier's\u00a0lack of punctuality, but has also increasingly manifested itself in a thinned-out network that has been shrinking for years. Surprisingly, this has happened against the backdrop of rising demand for its services, with goods volumes and passenger numbers having increased at the same time.\nBosselman said you could see the ruins left by a chronically underfunded rail company every day. As we pass a steel bridge, he points\u00a0to rusty, moss-covered tracks nearby, which he says have been disused for a long time. \"You could have a much higher volume of traffic here, if you invested a few euros into this replacement track.\"\nAt the end of the 1990s, Germany was hit by a severe economic crisis, with the government cutting spending wherever possible. Deutsche Bahn, which is fully owned by the state, became an easy target for the cuts leading to a dramatic decline of investment in rail infrastructure.\nAlthough this has changed in recent years, the government still spends comparatively little money on Germany's railway infrastructure. According to the Pro-Rail Alliance \u2014 a lobby group that unites nonprofit pro-rail campaigners with railway sector companies \u2014 Germany spends about \u20ac115 ($121) per capita on its railways\u00a0annually, while countries such as Austria or Switzerland invest three to four times as much.\nTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video\nThe Federal Court of Auditors \u2014 an independent body that audits the federal budget and oversees the management of public funds\u00a0\u2014 highlighted the years of neglect and current underfunding in a recent report. It declared Deutsche Bahn a \"case for restructuring,\" and lambasted the government for having \"failed to address key rail policy questions for three decades.\"\nThe comprehensive reconstruction plan was supposed to be the answer to many of DB's woes, with the government earmarking \u20ac30 billion-\u20ac50 billion for\u00a0the endeavor over the next three years. But now, after the collapse of the government, Germany has no budget for the next year which could threaten the funding for some of the rail projects.\nChristian B\u00f6ttger, a professor at\u00a0the Berlin University of Applied Sciences for Technology and Economics whose research areas include railroads, said he believed that DB would get the money one day, but only after a new government has been formed. \"A cancellation by a new government seems politically very unlikely to me, but even the already imminent postponement of construction projects is, of course, a disaster,\" he told DW.\nBosselman is not too worried about deep cuts to railway funding in the future. He said politicians had realized that DB is part of Germany's \"critical infrastructure.\" However,\u00a0he believes that the current budget shortfalls will come at the expense of DB's\u00a0reboot. \"In Germany, roads have always taken precedence over rail, and that's why I feel that cuts to rail are more likely.\"\nBosselman intends to stay positive, as he believes that there's already \"a lot of negativity\u00a0going around\" in German politics. \"If you kind of give in to all that negativity, your life won't be too positive down the road,\" he said. \"I can't see myself sad or disappointed in everything,\" he added. \"There is always something to look up for.\"\nSo, instead of complaining about his employer, he aims to boost his career at the end of the year\u00a0with a master's degree in railway operations, which, he said, could be a \"door-opener to a leadership role\" so that he can try to \"transform Deutsche Bahn from the inside.\"\nAnd some German passengers, though small in numbers, also have a reason for hope regarding improvements in\u00a0rail services. DB announced a few weeks ago that the reconstruction of the Riedbahn would soon be completed, with service on the route scheduled to resume by mid-December \u2014 surprisingly for the rail operator, this would be right on schedule and just in time to complete the first project of the reconstruction plan ahead of the country's fresh elections.\nThis article was originally written in German.\nEditor's note:\u00a0An earlier version of this article incorrectly stated that the German ruling coalition collapsed on November 4.

            "summary": "Defense Minister Boris Pistorius has emerged as a leading candidate for the chancellorship within the Social Democratic Party (SPD), following the collapse of the coalition government. Despite his popularity and support from party members, Pistorius has remained loyal to current Chancellor Olaf Scholz. Since taking office in January 2023, Pistorius has focused on reforming the underfunded German armed forces amid the Ukraine conflict, pushing for significant arms purchases and the establishment of a permanent brigade in Lithuania. His straightforward approach has earned him respect, making him the most favored politician in Germany.",
            "content": "Defense Minister Boris Pistorius is the most popular German politician. Many party supporters would like to see him as the SPD's candidate for chancellor.\nIn recent days,\u00a0Boris Pistorius has been talked about as a possible candidate for chancellor for his center-left Social Democratic Party (SPD).\nAfter the collapse of the center-left coalition government at the beginning of November, this discussion has gathered pace: Pistorius was repeatedly brought into play as an alternative to Chancellor Olaf Scholz, who wants to lead his party into the election campaign again as the chancellor candidate, despite his poor approval ratings.\nSupport for Pistorius' possible candidacy comes\u00a0from the rank-and-file of his Social Democrat Party\u00a0as well as from prominent SPD members. Pistorius has refused to be drawn into the discussion, and has repeatedly emphasized his loyalty to Scholz.\nTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video\nWhen Pistorius was offered the position of German defense minister in January 2023, he\u00a0was confident enough to accept what is often regarded as a hot seat in Berlin politics.\u00a0Whoever is in charge of the chronically underfunded and poorly equipped Bundeswehr has been likely to make many mistakes.\nPistorius took office as defense minister on January 19, 2023, at a difficult time. The Russian invasion of Ukraine and subsequent German arms shipments to Kyiv revealed once again how poorly equipped the Bundeswehr was. Handing over some of its most powerful weapons systems to Ukraine, the Bundeswehr was left nearly empty-handed.\nHowever, Pistorius acted swiftly and decisively. A one-time appropriation budget of \u20ac100 billion ($105 billion) for the German army was approved by the government in June 2022, and Pistorius pushed ahead with a number of major arms purchases. This included urgently needed air defense systems, helicopters, tanks\u00a0and frigate warships.\nPistorius\u00a0pushed for a Bundeswehr brigade \u2014 around 5,000 soldiers \u2014 to be stationed permanently in Lithuania, where it is due to be operational by 2027. This decision marked a first in the history of German defense policy and was not without controversy, partly due to the high costs involved \u2014 all the more so as Pistorius had failed to secure significantly more money for the German army in the regular defense budget for 2025.\nPistorius' stated aim has been to successfully transform the German armed forces and make them operational again, while at the same time supporting Ukraine. The German armed forces are to\u00a0become \"ready for war\" again, as he put it \u2014 a choice of words that some critics found too aggressive. But for Pistorius, this simply means \"being ready to go to war in order to avoid having one.\"\nTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video\nPistorius quickly earned the respect and esteem of both the Cabinet and the troops. His hands-on, unpretentious manner and his straight talking has gone down well with the soldiers.\nWithin weeks of taking office, the new defense minister had climbed to the top of popularity polls, ahead of his colleagues in the Cabinet and Chancellor Scholz himself.\nPistorius is a candidate for the lower house of parliament, the Bundestag, in his home district of Hanover in Lower Saxony. This is where he gained his political experience at the local and state level,\u00a0serving for many years as regional interior minister.\nBorn on March 14, 1960, Pistorius grew up with his two brothers in Osnabr\u00fcck, a northern city in the German state of Lower Saxony. His mother was a local SPD politician, and he himself joined the SPD in 1976. After doing a business apprenticeship and the completion of his compulsory military service, he studied law. He then worked as a lawyer before deciding to pursue a career in local and state politics.\nIn 2006, Pistorius became mayor of Osnabr\u00fcck, where he had always been a loyal supporter of the local VFL soccer team. When the Social Democrats won the state election\u00a0in Lower Saxony in 2013, he became interior minister in the new coalition government between the SPD and the Greens.\nIn this new position, Pistorius made domestic security his main issue, strengthening the police force and initiating legislation to tighten gun laws. Pistorius remained interior minister in Lower Saxony for 10 years.\nBut while his political career was taking off, it was a difficult time for him privately. In 2015, his wife, with whom he has two daughters, died of cancer. Pistorius, who has described himself as \"a real family man,\"\u00a0remarried at the end of 2023.\nThis article was originally written in German.\nWhile you're here: Every Tuesday, DW editors round up what is happening in German politics and society.

He sees himself as a fact-oriented pragmatist who, rather than putting on a show,\u00a0only says as much as is absolutely necessary, while working quietly and efficiently.\nThat strategy worked well for him during his time as finance minister, when he quickly provided billions in aid to companies affected by the shutdowns during the COVID-19 pandemic.\nHowever, he has failed to realize that the job of chancellor requires far more communication.

But with Scholz's low popularity ratings and the election campaign already heating up, calls in the party came up to\u00a0replace Scholz with 64-year-old Defense Minister Boris Pistorius, who has been Germany's\u00a0most popular politician in polls for months.\nIf,\u00a0as predicted,\u00a0the center-right bloc of the\u00a0Christian Democratic Union (CDU) and the\u00a0Christian Social Union (CSU) takes over the chancellorship, Scholz will have had the shortest term of office of any of the four\u00a0chancellors of the SPD in the history of the Federal Republic of Germany.\nBut Scholz is determined to win.

            "content": "Germans will head to the polls early next year after the coalition led by Chancellor Olaf Scholz collapsed.\nBerlin, Germany \u2013 In some countries, a snap election is held in a matter of weeks.\nGermany, by contrast, will enjoy a leisurely three months before it goes to the polls in an election that is likely to be overshadowed by the return of Donald Trump to the White House, an increasingly perilous situation in Ukraine, and a flagging domestic economy.\n\n\n\n\nGermany\u2019s ruling \u201ctraffic light\u201d coalition, formed by the Social Democratic Party (SPD), Greens and Free Democrats (FDP) collapsed on November 6, after Chancellor Olaf Scholz dismissed his finance minister, FDP leader Christian Lindner.\nScholz has announced a vote of confidence will take place on December 16. The snap poll is expected to take place on February 23.\nThe three-way alliance formed after the 2021 elections was a rarity for Germany, and the FDP\u2019s fiscal hawkishness always made an uneasy marriage with its centre-left partners, who campaigned in the 2021 elections on increased social and climate spending.\nThe final break came during preparations for the 2025 budget, with Scholz arguing to pause Germany\u2019s \u201cdebt brake\u201d, which tightly limits public borrowing. Lindner insisted on demanding major public spending cuts and rolling back climate targets.\nLast week in the Bundestag, Scholz accused the FDP leader of pitting the government\u2019s financial and military support for Ukraine against German pensioners.\nThe national weekly newspaper Die Zeit reported that the FDP had deliberately provoked Scholz to collapse the coalition and force an early election, which the party has denied.\n\u201cIt was difficult to reconcile those three very different political ideas and ideologies,\u201d said Markus Ziener, a senior fellow at the German Marshall Fund think tank, who believes infighting has weakened Germany\u2019s position within the European Union at a time when the bloc is sorely in need of leadership.\n\u201cThe hope could be that the next elections will bring much more stable conditions to form a reliable government.\u201d\nThe Christian Democratic Union (CDU) and its Bavarian sister party are currently polling at 32 percent, according to a recent INSA poll, more than all three of the coalition parties put together.\nFriedrich Merz, a former BlackRock board member who has moved the party rightward since becoming leader in 2022, is therefore well-placed to become the next chancellor.\nBased on current polling, he could lead a government with the SPD \u2013 based on the latest predictions likely to secure 16 percent, as a junior partner, a return to the familiar \u201cgrand coalition\u201d that was in place for three of Angela Merkel\u2019s four terms, or with the Greens, which are polling at 12 percent.\nMerz has promised to roll back several of the coalition\u2019s reforms, including on climate. He wants to lower taxes, reduce social welfare spending and tighten the country\u2019s borders.\n\u201cIt is time for a fundamental course correction in migration, security, foreign and economic policy,\u201d Merz told the Bundestag last week.\nScholz, now the least popular chancellor in post-war German history according to polls, has indicated that he will run again as the party\u2019s candidate.\nBut many senior figures in the SPD want to make a clear break with his tenure, and quickly. If he is to be deposed, Defence Minister Boris Pistorius is likely to replace him.\nThe far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) is on course to record a historic result.\nAssessments from Germany\u2019s domestic intelligence agency that several of the party\u2019s state branches are right-wing extremist organisations have not prevented the party from polling second, at 20 percent.\nThough all other parties refuse to form a coalition with the AfD, a strong performance could increase its influence on powerful parliamentary committees.\nMeanwhile, the FDP and the socialist Left party are currently below the 5 percent threshold required to enter parliament. The newly formed, left-wing Sahra Wagenknecht Alliance is at 7 percent.\nTrump\u2019s campaign promise to bring a quick end to the conflict in Ukraine, and threats to pull military assistance to President Volodymr Zelenskyy\u2019s government, come at a time when the war-torn nation is losing ground to Russia in the east and facing major attacks on its energy infrastructure ahead of winter.\nIf Trump follows through, Germany, Ukraine\u2019s second-largest backer, will be expected to dig deep and massively increase its military spending.\nScholz recently spoke with Russian President Vladimir Putin for the first time in two years. He tends to tread a more careful approach and has refused to deliver long-range Taurus missiles out of fears of escalating the conflict.\nBy comparison, Merz has been more hawkish on weapons deliveries and indicated he would approve the transfer, in line with the policies of the United Kingdom, France and the United States.\nPotentially adding further strain to the budget, Trump\u2019s plans to slap 20 percent tariffs on all imports and 60 percent on Chinese imports would have severe consequences for the economy, as Germany remains heavily reliant on exporting manufactured goods.\nEurope\u2019s largest economy is also its slowest growing.\nThough it has narrowly skirted recession, Germany\u2019s central bank said on Tuesday that the present stagnation is likely to continue in the face of weak international demand and investment, and the prospect of new US tariffs.\n\u201cWe\u2019re basically in a squeeze here. On the one hand, we probably have to deal with direct additional customs in the United States,\u201d said Ziener.\n\u201cOn the other hand, we will probably be very much affected by high duties against Chinese products.\u201d\nWith no end in sight to the economic woes, more financial institutions and business representatives are calling for a reform of Germany\u2019s debt brake to increase public investment, which has lagged for years.\nMerz, long known as a fiscal disciplinarian, has recently suggested an openness to reforming it, a possible sign of a shifting consensus.\nThe constitutional-anchored measure limits borrowing to 0.35 percent of gross domestic product (GDP), but special investment off-budget funds worth hundreds of billions have been used to circumvent it.\nDezernat Zukunft, a research institute that advocates for reform of the debt brake, estimates that Germany requires public spending of $782bn before 2030, which it says can be achieved without constitutional amendments.\n\u201cThe deeper question is whether there\u2019s a political majority for debt finance in Germany,\u201d said Max Krahe, director of research at Dezernat Zukunft, a research institute that campaigns for reform of the debt brake.\n\u201cTo say, yes, we are willing to use debt as a financing instrument to tackle all the problems in front of us, whether it\u2019s defence, decarbonisation, infrastructure, competitiveness, education, healthcare.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFollow Al Jazeera English:",

            "content": "Germany's political parties have begun presenting their draft election manifestos ahead of the snap election in February 2025. They focus on income, the economy and jobs.\nGermany's center-right bloc of Christian Democratic Union (CDU) and its Bavarian sister party Christian Social Union (CSU) has unanimously voted in favor of an election program that promises to lower taxes and stop illegal migration.\nThe CDU/CSU wants to reduce income tax and gradually lower taxes for companies to 25%. It promises not to cut old age pensions and plans to encourage those who want to continue working beyond retirement age of 67, allowing them to earn up to \u20ac2,000 ($2,100) per month tax-free on top of their pension.\nThe problem: The bold ideas of CDU chancellor candidate Friedrich Merz will cost billions of euros, and will be extremely hard to implement\u00a0if the CDU/CSU refuses to ease the \"debt brake.\" Enshrined in\u00a0\u00a0Germany's Basic Law, the brake limits fresh debt to a maximum of 0.35% of economic output (GDP).\nAlthough he himself is not popular with the electorate, Merz's party is currently significantly ahead in opinion polls, and he has a good chance of becoming the next chancellor after the snap election on February 23.\nTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video\nThe Social Democrats (SPD) want to reform the debt brake in order to make billions of euros available for urgently needed investments, for example in the ailing infrastructure. The party is also focusing on tax incentives for companies hoping to increase investment.\nIn line with its message to low-income voters, the SPD wants the super-rich with assets of more than \u20ac100 million to pay a wealth tax. In the Bundestag this week, Chancellor Olaf Scholz announced that he would raise the statutory minimum wage once again: \"In the last election campaign, I promised a minimum wage of \u20ac12, and I have kept that promise. That's why I'm fighting for a \u20ac15 minimum wage in the next federal election.\"\nIn the past three years of government, the Greens have been facing criticism over their climate protection plans. Now the party has scaled back its demands to reduce greenhouse gases compared to the 2021 election campaign.\nThe Greens also want to reform the debt brake, introduce subsidies for electric cars, and propose a new \"citizens' fund\" to secure pensions. This fund should also be fed with state money. And they want a billionaire's tax, as vice-chancellor and leading candidate Robert Habeck said in an interview with the tabloid Bild.\nAccording to expert estimates, there are currently 249 billionaires in Germany: \"If you taxed a small proportion of their wealth, you would have around five to six billion euros,\" was Habeck's calculation. He said this money could be invested in education.\nLike the Greens, the Free Democratic Party (FDP) is also calling for a reform of pensions. Party leader Christian Lindner is campaigning for the introduction of a share-based pension. The FDP's demands for a fundamentally different economic policy were the main reason for the break-up of the coalition government with SPD and the Greens in November.\nMany of those demands have now appeared in the party's election program: Easing the tax burden on companies with high energy prices, and less bureaucracy.\nThe socialist Left Party wants to introduce higher taxes for the wealthy, including an inheritance tax of 60% for those with an inheritance of \u20ac3 million or more.\nThe Left Party also wants to raise the minimum wage to \u20ac15 and pensions to 53% (from currently 48%) of the recipient's net income. It wants to boost public transport to make sure there is at least an hourly bus and train service for rural areas, and to ban flights that are shorter than 500 kilometers or five hours by train.\nAccording to its draft election manifesto, the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) wants Germany to leave the EU and abolish the euro. It denies the existence of man-made climate change and advocates setting up new coal-fired power plants and nuclear power stations, and to resume the import of Russian natural gas.\nThe AfD\u00a0also wants even tougher border controls that push back refugees who have traveled through other EU countries to get to Germany. They even want to detain asylum-seekers at the border while their applications are processed.\nThe CDU/CSU is also in favor of turning back refugees at the borders. Following the fall of Syrian ruler Bashar Assad, CDU chancellor candidate Merz does not want to allow any more people from Syria to come to Germany. The SPD, FDP and Greens also agree to a more consistent deportation of asylum seekers who have committed crimes.\nChancellor Olaf Scholz wants to address voter concerns about the war in Ukraine. His SPD has vowed to continue to support Ukraine but does not want to supply long-range missiles that could reach targets in Russia. However, this is precisely what Merz has repeatedly spoken out in favor of in recent months.\nAll the parties will vote on their draft manifestos at special party conferences in the New Year. This will be followed by a short and certainly heated campaign until the election on February 23.\nThis article was originally written in German.\nTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video\nWhile you're here: Every Tuesday, DW editors round up what is happening in German politics and society.

The rise of the far-right AfD party complicates the political landscape further.",
            "content": "Follow:\nGermany, Europe\u2019s largest economy and normally a pillar of stability, is facing snap elections next year after Chancellor Olaf Scholz lost a vote of confidence.\nHis government collapsed in November in a budget dispute but his coalition had been unsteady for months.\nScholz lost the vote, which he called himself as a step toward securing an early national election, with 394 ballots against him, 207 in his favor and 116 abstentions.\nWith the election date set for February 23 next year, here\u2019s what\u2019s at stake.\nThere will be seven major parties for which Germans will vote. Four of the seven have made official announcements about their Kanzlerkandidaten \u2013 candidates for chancellor.\nThe ever-present two dominant parties of German politics, the Christian Democrats (CDU) and Christian Social Union (CSU), unofficially known as the Union, make up one grouping. The Social Democrats, or SPD, form another.\nGiven the German system of proportional representation, the government tends to be formed in a coalition, usually headed by the CDU/CSU or the SPD.\nThe winner looks for a partner to form a majority. Since 2021, Scholz\u2019s SPD had governed in an uneasy coalition with the liberal Free Democrats Party (FDP) and the Green Party. In the 16 years before Scholz\u2019s three-party coalition, the CDU, under Angela Merkel, had relied on both the SPD and the FDP as partners in different governments.\nRelated video\n\u2018Complete chaos\u2019: CNN reporter breaks down Germany\u2019s political crisis\nThe CDU/CSU this time around will be led by Friedrich Merz, and the SPD by the incumbent but deeply unpopular chancellor, Scholz.\nThe far-right Alternative for Deutschland party (AfD) has seen strong performances in regional elections give it a national boost. The party\u2019s co-leader, Alice Weidel, is its Kanzlerkandidat. She is known for slick talking and populist policies, particularly on migration. She\u2019s an ardent supporter of upholding traditional German values, famously saying \u201cno one touch my schnitzel!\u201d \u2013 a reference to the popular dish.\nThe Green Party should also be considered one to watch. It is unlikely to gather enough votes to be the biggest party, but nonetheless could play an important role in the formation of the next government. The Greens will be led by Robert Habeck, currently the nation\u2019s Economics Minister.\nThe three other major parties will be the Free Democrats; the BSW, a left-wing socialist group named after its leader, Sahra Wagenknecht; and lastly Die Linke, a left-wing political party. All three have yet to officially announce their candidates.\nBarring a major and unexpected reversal in the polls, Merz of the CDU/CSU is highly likely to be Germany\u2019s new chancellor.\nNational opinion polls currently have the CDU/CSU way out ahead of the others, with 32% of support from those surveyed. The AfD are currently polling in second place with 18%, the SPD in third with 16%, and the Greens with 14%.\nMerz is not a newcomer to German politics, but this is his second iteration as a politician.\nBetween 1989 and 1994, Merz was a member of the European Parliament (MEP) for Germany. He subsequently became a member of the Bundestag, or German parliament, representing the CDU there until 2009. He then left politics to work as a corporate lawyer, where he sat on many supervisory boards, including at investment giant BlackRock.\nMerz represents the constituency of Hochsauerlandkreis in the Bundestag, the region in which he was born, and currently lives in his hometown of Brilon. He is also widely reputed to be a millionaire and has a private pilot\u2019s license.\nMerz made two failed attempts to become CDU head in 2018 and 2020. In 2021 he returned as a member of the Bundestag, for the first time in 12 years, and subsequently went on to secure the nomination as head of the CDU, officially taking over in September 2022.\nRelated article\nZelensky accuses German chancellor of opening \u2018Pandora\u2019s box\u2019 with Putin\nHe is known for having shifted the CDU to the right, with a tougher stance on migration, and a strong economic mind. During his bid to become party leader, he campaigned on not being a Merkel-style heir, unlike his challengers, thus marking the end of the centrist policies of the CDU during her era as chancellor.\nLeonie von Randow, a political reporter at German broadcaster WELT TV who will be covering the election campaign, told CNN that Merz \u201cknows a thing or two about the economy, and that is obviously something that many people care about. Many people hope (he) can move things forward.\u201d\nMerz is a very strong proponent of backing Ukraine as it fights Russia\u2019s full-scale invasion. He has been a vocal supporter of giving Ukraine German-made Taurus missiles, weapons that could be used to attack Russian targets far beyond Ukraine\u2019s front lines. Scholz, by contrast, has consistently refused to supply them to Kyiv.\nMerz made a surprise trip to the Ukrainian capital earlier this month, where he urged European nations to form a \u201ccommon vision\u201d for peace in Ukraine, especially given the impending arrival of US President-elect Donald Trump in the White House.\nThe economy is going to play a central role in the election, particularly given its sluggish performance under Scholz.\nIn recent days the German Central Bank has revised down predicted growth forecasts by 0.2%, stating that \u201cthe German economy is set to stagnate in the winter half-year 2024-25 and only begins to make a slow recovery over the course of 2025.\u201d\nConnected to the debate on the economy will be a focus on reviving the country\u2019s important automotive industry. The Central Bank has said that problems within the industry are \u201cstructural,\u201d and are thus exacerbating the drag on the economy.\nMajor companies including Volkswagen, one of world\u2019s largest car manufacturers, are facing major layoffs and plant closures.\nArguments over immigration will also be critical in this election, particularly as parties look to lure votes away from a surging AfD, which has made it a core issue.\n\u201cThe election is probably coming at a very good time for the AfD\u2026 this is a moment when many people are generally very unhappy with the government, so they kind of want to make a point and vote for an extreme party to show how unhappy they are,\u201d von Randow told CNN.\nScholz reintroduced checks on borders with neighboring European nations in recent months, a move many saw as him trying to curry favor with voters who may be turning towards the populist AfD.\nThe collapse of the Assad regime in Syria will also play into the national debate. Germany took in more Syrian migrants than any other European nation during its civil war. Campaigning around how each party would handle immigrants has already started.\nIt is very hard to see an outcome where the CDU/CSU and Friedrich Merz do not emerge victorious.\nTheir lead appears cemented and unassailable, but the major question surrounds the formation of a stable government. The CDU/CSU are unlikely to win an outright majority of the 630 seats up for grabs. That means they will have to form a coalition with one (or more) of the other parties. The question is who?\nShould the AfD perform as the opinion polls suggest, it would mark a major sea change in German politics. Since its formation in 2013, the party has never gained more than 94 seats. It finished as the fifth biggest party in 2021 and third largest in 2017.\nWhile the AfD will see themselves as potential kingmakers, the CDU/CSU may be unwilling to give them such a prominent voice in running the country.\nThat leaves the SPD, with whom they have worked previously, particularly in the Merkel era. Or, they could look further left towards the Greens, but that also may come with a clash of principles and policies, given their more left-leaning nature.\nEither way, the federal election looks likely to leave the SPD and Scholz deeply humbled, and entering into a period of self-reflection. \u201cIt is probably the end of his political career,\u201d von Randow told CNN.\nCNN\u2019s Benjamin Brown contributed to this report.\n\u00a9 2025 Cable News Network.

            "content": "Olaf Scholz has said he hopes to meet the incoming US president before Germans vote in February. Campaigning has officially kicked off a day after the German government lost a confidence vote. DW has the latest.\nGermany will hold snap elections on February 23.\nThe conservative Christian Democratic Union\u00a0(CDU), the center-left Social Democrats (SPD) and the neoliberal Free Democratic Party\u00a0(FDP) are all unveiling their election platforms on Tuesday.\nThe announcements come a day after Chancellor Olaf Scholz of the SPD lost a confidence vote in the Bundestag, or parliament, paving the way for it to be dissolved.\nHere are the latest developments about the start of the German election campaign on Tuesday, December\u00a017. This blog has now closed.\nThe Green Party and the\u00a0Alternative for Germany (AfD) have slammed German public broadcasters for scheduling an election TV debate featuring only\u00a0Social Democratic (SPD) candidate and incumbent Chancellor Olaf Scholz and the leader of the conservative opposite Christian Democrats (CDU), Friedrich Merz.\nGreen Party leader Franziska Brantner took to social media to accuse license-fee-funded\u00a0ARD and ZDF of \"interfering in an open election\" by not inviting other party representatives, including the Greens' chancellor candidate Robert Habeck. \"The reality of the options to form the next government cannot reflected by a two-way debate,\" she continued. \"It requires equal opportunities.\"\nGreen Party parliamentary leader Katharina Dr\u00f6ge said: \"Are they serious? They've only invited the SPD and CDU? Some friendly support on the way back to the GroKo*?\"\nHer party colleague Irene Mihalic added: \"In an extremely short election campaign, ARD and ZDF are manufacturing a political landscape which has nothing to do with reality.\"\nThe far-right populist AfD, meanwhile, says it is considering legal action against the exclusion of party leader Alice Weidel from the debate, complaining that \"the party currently with the second-highest poll ratings\" was being relegated to the sidelines.\nThe AfD were excluded from a three-way TV debate ahead of the 2021 federal election featuring Scholz, Armin Laschet (CDU) and Annalena Baerbock (Greens).\n\"Now a new standard has been set whereby the current chancellor only faces the supposedly strongest challenger,\" said a spokesperson. \"The Greens are collateral damage and have been left behind with the AfD.\"\nScholz and Merz will face each other on free-to-air channels ARD and ZDF on February 9 and again on private channel RTL on February 16.\n*GroKo is a commonly used abbreviation for Grosse Koalition (\"Grand Coalition\"), the nickname given to a coalition government formed by Germany's two largest traditional parites, the SPD and the CDU. The GroKo last formed the German government between 2013 and 2021 under former Chancellor Angela Merkel.\nGermany's political parties have begun presenting their draft election manifestos. And with Europe's largest economy struggling, they focus on income, the economy and jobs.\nDW looks at the campaign platforms of the major parties.\nOne day after losing a vote of confidence in parliament, outgoing German Chancellor Olaf Scholz has said he hopes to visit US President-elect Donald Trump after he is formally sworn in on January 20, 2025.\nGermany's dpa news agency has reported that Scholz \"expressed his wish to visit him very soon after taking office\" when the chancellor called Trump in early November to congratulate him on defeating Joe Biden to return to the White House.\nThough Germany will likely vote on February 23 after the collapse of its government, sources in Berlin told dpa it \"cannot be ruled out\" that Scholz could meet Trump in DC.\nThough Trump took the unusual step of inviting Chinese President Xi Jinping to his swearing-in there has been no word yet as to which other leaders had been asked to attend.\nNeither Berlin nor Washington have given any indication that Scholz's name was on the list of invitees.\nThe Greens have presented their 70-page policy draft to party members, including a raft of social programs aimed at helping families and addressing climate change.\nThese include increased rent controls, keeping the 49-euro public transport ticket for all of Germany,\u00a0a minimum wage of 15 euros, and benefits for people dealing with skyrocketing energy prices.\nThe program\u00a0is \"full of measures that will make this country fairer and life more affordable,\"\u00a0party leader Felix Banaszak stressed at the presentation.\nForeign Minister Annalena Baerbock and Green chancellor candidate Robert Habeck also attended the event.\nHabeck said that addressing climate change was the party's \"top priority.\" In order to finance their ambitious climate plans, the party wants to introduce a billionaires' tax, reform the debt brake, and close tax loopholes for companies.\nFDP leader Lindner and party secretary Marco Buschmann kept their policy proposals to their party's bread and butter: the economy.\nThe business-friendly FDP said they want to lower taxes on individual earners who make less than\u00a096,600\u20ac ($101, 400) a year, as well as lower taxes on companies and on inheritance.\nChanging Germany's debt brake, which limits the amount of money the government can borrow, is \"absolutely forbidden,\" the pair confirmed.\nArguments about the debt brake were central to Lindner's falling out with Chancellor Olaf Scholz, as some economists argue that Germany's infrastructure and industry will continue to stagnate if it does not borrow money to modernize.\nThe FDP also wants to \"completely reform\" social welfare for the country's lowest earners, they said.\nAnother facet of the program is to limit the ability of \"essential workers\" to strike, such as those in the health, energy, and education sectors.\nTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video\nFormer Finance Minister Christian Lindner, whose dismissal precipitated the collapse of Germany's coalition in November, was the main speaker at his pro-business Free Democrats (FDP)'s conference on Thursday.\nThe election on \"February 23 of next year\u00a0marks a directional decision for our country,\" he said. He warned that without implementing the economic reforms his party is suggesting, \"more and more people will look for an alternative to the democratic center.\"\nHis use of the word alternative alluded to the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD), which is currently in second place in most voter surveys.\nAlthough the FDP is currently only polling at 5%, barely clearing the hurdle to enter the Bundestag, Lindner delivered his remarks with the seriousness of one who expects his party to become kingmakers in future coalition talks.\nAs it has in the past, Lindner said he was sure the FDP \"would play a key role in building the future government.\"\nLindner's open disagreements with the SPD and Green parties about policy, despite being the most junior member of the coalition, were at the heart of why Chancellor Scholz demanded his resignation.\nDuring an event to announce the party\u2019s election program, CDU and CSU leaders took to criticizing the current government and its head, Chancellor Olaf Scholz.\nCSU head Markus S\u00f6der went as far as calling Scholz \"the most embarrassing chancellor Germany has ever had.\"\nThis comes after Scholz said on television that\u00a0CDU leader Friedrich Merz \"likes to talk nonsense.\"\nS\u00f6der also criticized Germany\u2019s Green party for being \"incompetent,\"\u00a0also saying Germany\u2019s conservatives are currently unlikely to cooperate with the Greens due to their policies.\nThe conservative coalition of the CDU and CSU said that \"business as usual is not an option.\"\nGermany's conservative coalition, made of the Christian Democratic Union (CDU) and Bavarian sister party Christian Social Union (CSU) unanimously voted in favor of the party\u2019s program for the 2025 elections.\nThe program includes a promise to lower taxes and de-facto stop illegal migration.\nThe party will also continue its support for Ukraine and will re-introduce compulsory military service, previously canceled in 2011, according to a report by German news agency DPA.\nThe party\u2019s leader and Chancellor candidate\u00a0Friedrich Merz\u00a0said he believes the conservative Union \"must become the guarantors of peace and freedom.\"\nAs Germany heads for elections, authorities in Berlin fear that the February 23 vote will also be a target for pro-Russian propaganda.\nMedia investigations have pointed to Kremlin-linked efforts to support the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) and boost the Russia-friendly views of the left-wing populist Sahra Wagenknecht\u00a0Alliance (BSW).\nGermany\u2019s Interior Ministry has set up a taskforce to take \"the necessary protection measures\"\u00a0against any disinformation, sabotage, espionage and cyber attacks.\n\"Whether we like it or not, we are in a direct confrontation with Moscow,\"\u00a0Germany\u2019s foreign intelligence chief Bruno Kahl has warned.\nGermany is officially going to elections, and debate preparations are now underway.\nThis comes after the current government, under the leadership of Chancellor Olaf Scholz\u00a0of the SPD\u00a0lost a confidence vote on Monday, resulting in him asking President Frank-Walter Steinmeier to call early elections.\nScholz is expected to face his main opponent, conservative CDU\u00a0leader Friedrich Merz, in at least two televised debates prior to the elections, which are expected to take place on February 23.\nPublic broadcasters ARD and ZDF are planning one debate on February 9, while private broadcaster RTL will hold another debate on February 16.\nTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video\nftm/zc (dpa, Reuters, AFP)",

            "content": "Chancellor Olaf Sholz\u2019s government coalition imploded and his poll numbers are dismal. But, at his party\u2019s conference this weekend, he made it clear that he won\u2019t give up without a fight.\nThe majority of the 600 delegates at Saturday's conference for the center-left Social Democratic Party (SPD) in Berlin officially confirmed Chancellor Olaf Scholz as the\u00a0party's\u00a0top candidate in Germany's upcoming parliamentary election.\nThe 66-year-old Scholz's governing coalition of the SPD, Greens and neoliberal Free Democrats (FDP) failed dramatically at the end of 2024, sparking a vote of no confidence that resulted in the snap election\\ scheduled for February 23.\nNow, according to a poll by public broadcaster ARD, 77% of Germans are dissatisfied with Scholz's leadership, and the SPD squabbled for weeks about whether one of their more popular members should\u00a0lead the campaign.\nScholz, who possesses a singular self-confidence and avoids basing his actions on polls, is likely to have been unmoved by these concerns. With his political survival at stake, Scholz seemed decisive and combative at the party conference. If the SPD loses the Bundestag elections on February 23 as polls suggest that they will, Scholz's three-year term of office will have been the shortest in the last fifty years.\nThe SPD currently has just under half of the support that poll respondents have expressed for the conservative Christian Democrats (CDU) and their Bavarian allies, the Christian Social Union (CSU). But a lot could still happen between now and election day \u2014 at least that's what SPD members are telling each other.\n\"It's a damn serious time, a time when dramatic things are happening,\" Scholz said in his nearly hourlong speech to SPD members.\u00a0\"These are things that no one would have thought possible just a few years ago, perhaps even a few months or even weeks ago.\"\nThe January 20 swearing-in of\u00a0Donald Trump\u00a0as US president is already fomenting diplomatic angst, as he makes territorial claims to Greenland, the Panama Canal and Canada. He has also made the breathtaking demand that every NATO country contribute 5% of their economic output to defense, when only two-thirds of the members currently manage to meet their 2% commitment.\nTrump's antics could offer Scholz opportunities in the election campaign. At the party conference, he once again rejected Trump's claims: \"The principle of the inviolability of borders applies to every country, regardless of whether it is to the east or west of us. Every state must adhere to this principle. No country is the backyard of another. No small country should have to fear its larger neighbor. That is at the core of what we call Western values, our values,\"\u00a0he said.\nFor some, the speech was a hopeful reminder of 2003, when the SPD chancellor,\u00a0Gerhard Schr\u00f6der, opposed US President George W. Bush's invasion of Iraq during his election campaign. His opposition earned him enough support to land a surprise win in the Bundestag elections.\nSPD members know that international affairs are likely to become even more turbulent after Trump takes office. \"This is also a time when certain forces in America are working very specifically to destroy our democratic institutions in the West,\"\u00a0Scholz warned. \"A time in which we cannot be sure how our relationship with the US will develop in the coming years.\"\nRussia invaded Ukraine almost three years ago, and the war has been raging ever since. The SPD stands by Ukraine \"without ifs or buts,\"\u00a0Scholz said, but added that as chancellor, he and his party would ensure \"that we are not dragged into this war.\"\n\"I will remain steadfast and level-headed, and all citizens in Germany can rely on that,\" Scholz said. \"My principles always apply. I never apply double standards.\"\nThe SPD hopes to mobilize nonvoters. In its 63-page program entitled \"More for you. Better for Germany,\"\u00a0the SPD focuses on a strong state, equity between rich and poor, and more investment in the economy, infrastructure and defense, financed by higher taxes for the rich and a bigger national debt. The reintroduction of a wealth tax and increased taxation of large inheritances are also included.\nTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video\nThe plan states that the welfare state should be preserved. \"Are we now making sure that ordinary people in Germany can get by with decent wages, affordable food and affordable rents? Or will ordinary people end up footing the bill for the CDU/CSU's tax giveaways to the rich and super-rich?\"\u00a0Scholz asked delegates. \"Are we now ensuring stable pensions, good health and care, intact schools and daycare centers \u2014 or are we cutting back everywhere on these things?\"\nThe SPD wants to set up what it calls the \"Germany Fund\"\u00a0to invest in electricity and heating grids, charging stations and housing construction. Additionally, the party wants to implement a \"Made in Germany\"\u00a0bonus: investments in machinery and equipment that would be subsidized with 10% of the purchase price via a tax refund.\nThe cost of these proposals hasn't been fully calculated. The German Economic Institute estimates that the funding gap amounts to \u20ac30 billion ($30.7 billion) per year, though the gap for the CDU and CSU program is three times that size.\nThe SPD also warns against turning \"to the right\"\u00a0on migration and asylum policy, saying Germany must remain a country that supports immigration. \"Three out of 10 people in our country have a history of immigration. Those who live and work here permanently, who are well integrated, who speak German, should be able to belong to our country, they should be able to have a say in our democracy,\"\u00a0Scholz said.\nThe country is at a \"crossroads,\"\u00a0Scholz said. \"If we take a wrong turn in Germany on February 23, we will wake up the next morning in a different country.\"\nThis article was originally written in German.",

Lindner said that ultimately his choice was between upholding the constitution or not.\nBavarian State Premier Markus S\u00f6der on Wednesday demanded expediency from Germany's outgoing SPD/Greens/FDP coalition, demanding, \"The confidence question must be put immediately and not next year\" and adding, \"there must be no tactical delays.\"\nS\u00f6der was in Berlin Wednesday to meet with Christian Democratic Union (CDU) leader Friedrich Merz after the collapse of Chancellor Olaf Scholz's government last week.\nS\u00f6der, who leads the CDU's Bavarian sister party the Christian Social Union (CSU), was himself in contention for the top spot on the CSU/CDU ballot early next year but bowed out in favor of Merz.\nSpeaking to reporters, S\u00f6der said, \"the chancellor question is decided. Friedrich Merz is doing it.\"\nDespite differences, S\u00f6der said he fully backed Merz, stressing that they were united by the shared aim of unseating the current government to \"get Germany back on track.\"\nMerz thanked S\u00f6der for his support and said his party had the \"firm intention of taking over leadership responsibility in this country again.\"\nBy stepping aside, S\u00f6der has left the path to the Chancellory open for Merz, an ambitious politician who served (in a strained relationship) under former Chancellor Angela Merkel before taking a job at the investment firm BlackRock and then returning to politics as an economic liberal with right-leaning tendencies on social issues and especially immigration.\nBavarian State Premier Markus S\u00f6der on Wednesday leveled harsh criticism at Olaf Scholz.\nS\u00f6der, who leads the Christian Social Union (CSU), the Bavarian sister party of the larger center-right Christian Democratic Union (CDU), said Scholz and Vice Chancellor Robert Habeck of the Greens were to blame for the \"disastrous situation\" that Germany now finds itself in.\n\"It takes courage to act as if you having nothing at all to do with the whole disaster. That is, ultimately, it was wholly failed finance policies that are the cause of all of Germany's budget problems.\"\nHabeck, said S\u00f6der, had become the face of the crisis, and continued to lambaste the outgoing coalition, saying it had left Germany, \"ungovernable.\"\nS\u00f6der's appearance in Berlin marked the first time the Bavarian had ever spoken in the Bundestag and he pulled no punches delivering his message, saying the coalition had severely damaged Germany's reputation at home and abroad.\n\"Laughter in Moscow, wrinkled foreheads in Europe and a grin from the US. You will go down as the weakest government in the history of the Federal Republic of Germany.\"\nFDP leader and former German Finance Minister Christian Lindneraccused Chancellor Olaf Scholz of failed economic policies.\u00a0Commenting on his resignation from the Chancellor last week, Lindner said: \"Sometimes a dismissal is also a liberation.\"\n\"Olaf Scholz's text says agenda, but there is no agenda in the text,\" he said\u00a0in the Bundestag, referring to a Chancellor's paper on economic policy presented to the coalition committee last week.\n\"If you're just running around in circles, you can't lead a progressive coalition,\" Lindner said.\nHowever,\u00a0Lindner still believes that Germany has what it takes to overcome the economic slump. \"Germany still has the potential for a strong comeback. We have the know-how, the capital, the brains,\" he said.\nTo achieve this, an economic policy that has been holding Germany back for more than a decade must be changed.\u00a0He added that Germany's values and interests could not be secured internationally \"by Germany lecturing others with a raised index finger\".\nLindner said: \"It is not moral feelings of superiority in foreign policy that secure our influence. Our economic strength is also our geopolitical strength.\"\n\"Our country must move from left to center,\" Lindner said, adding that\u00a0this election gives Germany such\u00a0an opportunity.\nForeign Minister Annalena Baerbock of the Green party spoke after Scholz's speech instead of Economy Minister Robert Habeck, who has been unable to attend the debate because of a problem with the\u00a0Bundeswehr\u00a0plane that was to bring him back from Lisbon.\nIn her speech, Baerbock emphasized Germany's strength and democratic principles despite insecurity in much of the rest of the world.\nShe stressed that she believed the German government under Scholz had taken responsibility for the problems the country does have, including in the field of energy supply, such as by weaning Germany off Russian gas amid Moscow's invasion of Ukraine.\nBaerbock also emphasized the need for a united Europe and strong Germany to face the challenges posed by the conflict in Ukraine and the climate crise.\nCDU leader Friedrich Merz accused Scholz of having rejected all his party's proposals to come to grips with illegal immigration.\nHe said any new government had to regain control over migration with expulsions at the border.\nMerz's Christian Democrats have been polling around 30% or more in the polls for a year now, while Scholz's Social Democrats, currently poll in\u00a0third place with around 16%, behind the AfD, which is at around 19%.\nWhile the main campaign issue will likely be the country's economy, immigration is another topic on the mind of German voters.\nThe leader of the Christian Democratic Union (CDU), Friedrich Merz, slammed Scholz after his speech, accusing him of being the person to split the country.\nHe called Scholz's alleged delay of the vote of confidence necessary for new elections \"simply unacceptable\" and a speech last week by the chancellor as \"unworthy of the leader of Germany.\"\nMerz insisted that the Bundestag was still capable of taking action, despite Scholz's no longer possessing a majority.\nHe said Germany needed a government that did not argue among itself along with a completely different political approach.\nMerz also stressed that he would not work together with the far-right AfD party, no matter how strong it became at new elections.\nThe CDU has been leading nationwide surveys for some months now, with Merz seen widely as favorite to win the planned snap elections in February.\nTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video\nScholz used his speech to call for more harmony in society, using the rifts made apparent by the recent US elections as a warning example.\nHe said he never wanted the degree of polarization in Germany to reach the same pitch.\nScholz said he had talked with US President-elect Donald Trump, stressing that US-Germany ties should remain good.\nScholz said he had a \"good conversation\" with Trump.\n\"We should do everything we can in the coming decades, regardless of who is in power here or there, to ensure that this relationship continues to develop well,\" Scholz said.\nScholz said that although he believed Europe had a responsibility to ensure Ukraine has a good future as the country fights against a Russian invasion, any support from Germany should not come at the cost of German prosperity.\nSupport for Ukraine must not lead to cuts in pensions or care, he said.\nAt the same time, Scholz vowed that Ukraine would \"not be left alone.\"\nHis remarks are possibly a response to calls by parties such as the AfD, the Left Party and the Alliance Sarah Wagenknecht to reduce or completely cut\u00a0German military aid to Kyiv.\nTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a

This follows the collapse of his center-left coalition government on November 6. Early elections are rare in Germany and require the president's approval, as parliament cannot dissolve itself. Historical precedents include past chancellors like Willy Brandt and Helmut Kohl, who similarly called for votes of confidence to trigger new elections, often in response to political crises and declining support.",
            "content": "German Chancellor Olaf Scholz is seeking a vote of confidence, which he is expected to lose. Does such a move work as a path to restore political stability?\nGerman Chancellor Olaf Scholz is seeking a vote of confidence in the lower house of Parliament, the Bundestag, which he is expected to lose, triggering an\u00a0early general election.\nScholz's three-way center-left government broke apart on November 6, paving the way for an early federal election\u00a0expected on\u00a0February 23, 2025.\nEarly elections have been extremely rare in Germany, but they are a vital democratic measure. They are regulated by the German constitution and require the approval of several constitutional bodies, not least of the head of state, the president.\nAccording to the German constitution, a decision to hold an early federal election\u00a0cannot be made by the members of the Bundestag, nor by the chancellor. An early dissolution of parliament can only come about in one of two ways.\nIn the first case, if a candidate for chancellor does not win an absolute parliamentary majority \u2014 at least 367 votes in the 733-seat Bundestag \u2014 the German president can dissolve the parliament. This has never happened in the history of the Federal Republic of Germany.\nTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video\nIn the second case, a chancellor can call for a vote of confidence in the Bundestag to confirm whether he or she still has sufficient parliamentary support. If the chancellor fails to win a majority, he or she can formally ask the president to dissolve the Bundestag within 21 days.\nFollowing the dissolution of parliament, an election\u00a0must be held within 60 days. They are organized in the same way as normal general elections, with the federal returning officer and the Federal Interior Ministry responsible for their implementation.\nThree early Bundestag elections have been held to date in the Federal Republic of Germany: in 1972, 1983 and 2005.\nWilly Brandt, the first chancellor from the center-left Social Democratic Party (SPD), governed in a coalition with the neoliberal Free Democratic Party (FDP)\u00a0beginning in 1969. His \"Ostpolitik\" (politics toward the East) led to a vote of confidence in 1972.\nBrandt had pushed ahead with his policy of rapprochement during the Cold War to ease relations with the socialist Eastern European bloc, a\u00a0highly controversial move in West Germany. Major splits emerged within the government, causing several SPD and FDP Bundestag lawmakers to quit. The government's majority was dramatically reduced, and Brandt's support fell to parity with the opposition conservatives, the Christian Democratic Union (CDU) and the regional Bavarian Christian Socialist Union (CSU): each side had 248 representatives in the Bundestag.\nThat stalemate paralyzed proceedings, so Brandt sought a solution. On June 24, 1972, he stated that \"the citizens\" had a \"right to ensure that legislation does not come to a standstill.\" He also said there was a growing danger \"that the opposition will fundamentally refuse to cooperate constructively. Therefore, I am\u00a0announcing that we are seeking new elections.\"\nBrandt called for a vote of confidence in the Bundestag with the aim of losing it, so that his chancellorship could be reconfirmed by voters in fresh elections. This move was fiercely criticized, also by constitutional lawyers who argued that deliberately losing a vote of confidence was not consistent with the spirit of the constitution, the Basic Law.\nBrandt stuck to his plan and called a vote of confidence on September 20, 1972 \u2014 and lost, as he had planned. That set the path for the Bundestag's dissolution and a\u00a0new election, which was held on November 19, 1972.\nBrandt was reelected as chancellor, and the SPD received 45.8% of the vote \u2014 its best result to date. Voter turnout was the highest ever for a Bundestag election, at 91.1%.\nHelmut Kohl, of the CDU, was responsible for the second early Bundestag election, in 1983. Kohl assumed power following a constructive vote of confidence in the then Chancellor Helmut Schmidt (SPD), in October 1982. The majority of parliamentarians had withdrawn their confidence in Schmidt due to differences over his economic and security policy.\nBecause Kohl's coalition of the CDU/CSU and FDP came to power through a vote of confidence and not a general election, Kohl wished for additional legitimacy through a general election. He called for a vote of confidence, which he, too, deliberately lost on December 17, 1982, resulting\u00a0in the dissolution of the Bundestag. Kohl said at the time, \"I opened the way to new elections in order to stabilize the government and obtain a clear majority in the Bundestag.\"\nSome Bundestag members found that unacceptable and filed a complaint with the Federal Constitutional Court. After 41 days of hearings, the Karlsruhe judges approved Kohl's path to a new election\u00a0by a deliberate vote of no confidence. However, they emphasized that a vote of confidence was only permissible during a \"genuine\" crisis.\nThe subsequent election\u00a0held on March 6, 1983, confirmed Kohl as chancellor, and his government was able to carry on with a clear majority.\nThe\u00a0SPD's\u00a0Gerhard Schr\u00f6der initiated Germany's third early election\u00a0in 2005. He was\u00a0chancellor at the time,\u00a0heading\u00a0a coalition with the Greens.\nThe SPD was struggling after a series of state election defeats and declining support in the Bundestag. The dwindling support was mostly due to Schr\u00f6der's controversial Agenda 2010 reforms, which had drastically changed the social system and the labor market. Schr\u00f6der called for a vote of confidence, which he deliberately lost on July 1, 2005, thus triggering a new election.\n\"I am firmly convinced that the majority of Germans want me to continue along this path. But I can only gain the necessary clarity only through a new election,\" Schr\u00f6der said after the vote.\nBut his calculation went afoul. The early election, held on September 18, 2005, gave Angela Merkel's CDU/CSU a narrow majority. She\u00a0became chancellor, heading a CDU/CSU-led\u00a0coalition supported by the SPD. That was the start of 16 years in office for Merkel.\nThis article was originally written in German.

But the list ends there.\n\"Some decisions, Mr. Chancellor, that you might like to see will objectively not be possible at all since we will enter the next year without an approved federal budget.\"\nDuring the ensuing debate, during which all the parties fired off several broadsides against one another, it became clear that the coming election campaign would be key to determining Germany's direction.\nScholz once again asserted that his coalition had failed because of a row over finances. The SPD and the Greens had repeatedly called for the so-called \"debt brake\" to be reformed and unsuccessfully pushed the FDP to take on additional loans.\nTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video\nAccording to Scholz, the FDP had insisted on playing foreign, domestic, economic and social security policies against each other financially. He said he could not allow that.\n\"I will never ask people to choose between investing in our security or in good jobs and the economy and infrastructure,\" said Scholz. He added\u00a0that it was irresponsible to choose between either spending money on the Bundeswehr or secure pensions, or: \"Either we support Ukraine or we invest in Germany.\"\nMerz did not make any specific comments on how his conservatives\u00a0would deal with finances if they won the election. However, it's clear that a government led by him would want to spend less money on social welfare.\nThe CDU/CSU has also decided to roll back the Greens' energy policy.\u00a0\"We want to move away from the one-sided focus on wind and solar energy, e-mobility and heating systems using renewables,\" the CDU leader told lawmakers.\nMerz also sees a real need for change in other policy areas. \"Germany needs a fundamentally different policy, especially in migration policy, in foreign, security and European policy and in economic policy,\"\u00a0he said on Wednesday.\nTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video\nThe CDU/CSU are clearly ahead in the polls.

However, new treaties cannot be signed until a new government takes over.\nTomorrow, the opposition Christian Democrats\u00a0are going to\u00a0launch\u00a0their party program.\nThe party is led by Friedrich Merz, who is widely expected to become the next chancellor.\nScholz's Social Democrats also look\u00a0set to launch their\u00a0party program in the afternoon.\nOlaf Scholz did not show enough leadership during his tenure as German chancellor, the Greens'\u00a0parliamentary group leader said on Monday.\n\"The long tugging and wrangling\"\u00a0over some legislative projects would have been avoidable \"if our Chancellor Olaf Scholz had shown more leadership,\"\u00a0Britta Hasselmann said after Monday's vote in the Bundestag.\nThe co-chair of the parliamentary group, Katharina Dr\u00f6ge, said\u00a0the opposition leader Friedrich Merz (CDU) was not ready for the snap election, penciled in for\u00a0February 23.\nAs for policies, Dr\u00f6ge said that the Greens wanted to ensure \"that the 49-euro ticket remains a 49-euro ticket.\"\nThe price of the ticket, which allows the holder to use public transport across many parts of Germany without extra charge, is set to increase to \u20ac58 in January.\nAfter Monday's\u00a0vote of no confidence, Olaf Scholz is no longer the chancellor of Germany as part of a minority coalition, but he does still act as the head of government.\nHowever, both the government and the Bundestag will remain fully functional in terms of global issues\u00a0in the transition phase until a new government is formed.\nWhen Scholz was confirmed as the future chancellor in 2021, his predecessor Angela Merkel, while\u00a0still in office, took the future German leader\u00a0to international appointments, for example with US President Joe Biden.\nThere will likely be a weeks-long transition phase after the parliamentary elections until a new coalition government is agreed upon.\nTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video\nAccording to the latest polls, Friedrich Merz's CDU holds a lead of more than 10 points over Olaf Scholz's SPD, though the advantage\u00a0has been narrowing recently.\nThe polls suggest Merz's CDU\u00a0and its Bavarian sister party, the Christian Social Union (CSU), have a\u00a032%\u00a0share of the vote.\nThe far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD), led by Alice Wiedel,\u00a0is slightly ahead of the SPD, while the Greens are in fourth place.\nThe mainstream parties have refused to govern with the AfD, but its presence complicates the parliamentary arithmetic, making unwieldy coalitions more likely.\nMerz said he wants to see the CDU and the CSU\u00a0be the strongest force in the Bundestag.\n\"We can do that. We are doing well in the polls at the moment,\" he said. \"But not as well as I see and think possible. However, an election campaign comes first from fighting and then from voting.\"\nScholz has traveled\u00a0to Berlin's\u00a0Bellevue Palace and proposed to German President Frank-Walter Steinmeier that the Bundestag be dissolved.\nThe president, Germany's head of state, will then have 21 days to decide whether to agree and to call a new election within 60 days.\nSteinmeier's approval is considered certain and\u00a0he has already indicated that he agrees with the proposed election date of February 23.\nHowever, it is expected that he will wait until after the Christmas holidays to make the decision, particularly as he\u00a0first wants to hold talks with all parliamentary groups\u00a0in the Bundestag.\nOver the weekend, Steinmeier said he would not be hurried into making a decision.\n\"The hectic pace of daily politics and the beat of the media do not now dictate the\u00a0procedure, but the constitution and its rules do,\" the German president told ARD.\nChancellor Olaf Scholz's minority coalition government has lost a confidence vote, paving the way for new elections in February.\nSome 394 lawmakers cast their votes against the government, with 207\u00a0voting in favor.\nAnother 116 abstained, leaving Scholz\u00a0far short of the majority of 367 needed to win.\nThe confidence vote came after the Free Democrats (FDP) left the coalition government with Scholz's center-left Social Democrats (SPD) and the Greens following disputes over the budget.\nTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video\nGermany's Left Party and the left-wing populist Sahra Wagenknecht Alliance (BSW) have accused Chancellor Olaf Scholz (SPD) of failings in economic and foreign policy.\nWagenknecht spoke of the \"inglorious end\" of a government that had noticeably worsened people's lives.\n\"Three years of decline for our country, and you are asking for a four-year extension,\" said Wagenknecht.\nThe co-chair of the Left Party, S\u00f6ren Pellmann, accused Scholz\u00a0of having set in motion the \"most violent arms race\" in light of Russia's war of aggression against Ukraine.\nGermany must \"invest its way out of the crisis.\" Pellmann said, hitting out at tax\u00a0rates\u00a0for top earners: \"This country does not need even richer billionaires.\"\nThe head of the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) party, Alice Weidel, criticized Scholz's government for the state of the German economy.\n\"Your government was in power for just three years. Germans will have to deal with the damage that you caused in this time,\" she said during the debate in the Bundestag.\nWeidel, who is running to become chancellor in next year's election, said that the economy had suffered due to \"massive lacking investment\" in the car industry while \"the chemical industry is fleeing\" due to \"exploding energy costs.\"\nShe also had words for the Greens Vice Chancellor Robert Habeck and the CDU's chancellor candidate Friedrich Merz.\nWeidel accused Habeck of ruining the country and said that Merz would send Taurus missiles to Ukraine. Whoever votes for Merz \"is voting for war,\" the far-right lawmaker said.\nShe also demanded that refugees from the war in Syria be sent home immediately, despite the continued uncertainty in the Middle Eastern country.\nIf German lawmakers decide to withdraw their support from Scholz, he will ask President Frank-Walter Steinmeier to dissolve parliament and call for early elections about seven months sooner than planned.\nTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video\nIn his speech before the Bundestag, former Finance Minister Christian Lindner took\u00a0the opportunity to attack\u00a0the economic policies\u00a0of the German chancellor.\nIn particular, the reduction in VAT on foodstuffs proposed by Scholz is unnecessary, the leader of the business-focused Free Democrats said.\nSuch a step would cost billions of euros but would not secure or create any jobs, he said.\n\"Prince Carnival may hand out candy on Rose\u00a0Monday, but the Federal Republic of Germany must not be governed like this,\" said Lindner, likening the measure\u00a0to a\u00a0German tradition of candy being thrown to crowds from procession floats on the last Monday before Lent.\nLindner said Germany was in a worsening economic crisis and called for a political turnaround to prevent further economic decline.\n\"We must be honest and tell the citizens: Never in history has a society defended its prosperity, its social security and its sense of ecological responsibility by making less effort, by working less, by coming up with fewer ideas and by being less willing to take entrepreneurial risks,\" said Lindner.\nRobert Habeck, Green vice chancellor and economy minister, took the podium shortly after opposition leader Merz called him the \"face of the economic crisis\" in Germany.\nHabeck pointed to other countries in Europe that are currently without a government or being governed by shaky coalitions: France, Belgium, Austria, and the Netherlands. He said this highlighted not only that Germany needed to cease navel-gazing, but that \"a new vote is not a guarantee that a new government will quietly and quickly get to work.\"\nLike Scholz, he blamed the FDP for \"being part of a government while simultaneously trying to destroy it.\"\nHabeck said that Germany needed a government that was \"ready to make compromises,\" which the current coalition did successfully for three years until the FDP decided to sabotage it.\nHe then slammed Merz's accusations that the SPD-led coalition had tanked the economy, citing the effects of the war in Ukraine and how the CDU under former Chancellor Angela Merkel had left Germany reliant on cheap Russian gas.\nThe vice chancellor called Merkels' decision a \"grand historical mistake.\" Energy prices have soared in Germany as the country moved to pivot away from Russian gas quickly in the aftermath of the invasion of Ukraine.\nAlluding mainly to the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD), Habeck said that the \"racism\" of the right-wing in Germany was \"the biggest threat\" to the national economy, because it was keeping skilled migrants away.\nThe leader of the opposition CDU Friedrich Merz accused the ruling coalition of hypocrisy. He\u00a0spoke ahead of a confidence vote over Chancellor Olaf Scholz's government.\n\"The chancellor spoke a lot about respect, but it seems as though his respect ends where other political opinions begin,\" he said, before calling it \"shameless\" to have spoken so highly of his accomplishments but so badly of the FDP, who he said helped him achieve\u00a0all of them.\nHe further asked why, if Scholz foresaw so much room for progress, the SPD hadn't accomplished any of it \"in the 22 years of the last 26\" when it was part of Germany's governing coalitions.\n\"Where were you for the last 22 years?\" he asked.\nMerz went on to criticize the funding of the military, the reaction to record-high inflation and an economic crisis, and Scholz's perceived lack of clarity and outspokenness on global issues over the last several years.\n\"You have brought shame on Germany\" in front of the EU and other allies, Merz said.\nHe also praised the FDP for what he described as trying to prevent the ruling SPD and Greens from raising taxes. Arguments over the national budget played a major role over the collapse of Scholz's coalition.\nReturning to the topic of the economy, Merz also implied that Germans do not work enough, citing neighboring Switzerland as a positive example, where people \"work on average 200 hours more\" a year. The conservative leader said that working more hours was necessary for \"making Germany more competitive.\"\nThese statements were met with loud consternation by other lawmakers.\nThe beginning of Chancellor Olaf Scholz's speech felt like the official kick-off of the election campaign.\nThe political groups in the Bundestag had rallied their troops and coordinated their planned applause for this special session. During Scholz\u2019s address, there was consistent applause only from his SPD group and individual members of the Greens, who form part of his government.\nThe business-friendly FDP, most of whose ministers were ousted by Scholz, kept their hands firmly on their desks.\nScholz highlighted many of Germany\u2019s current weaknesses. Observers on the visitors\u2019 benches made cynical comments, such as \u201cWait till he finds out who\u2019s in charge.\u201d\nWhen Scholz\u2019s strongest opponent, Friedrich Merz of the CDU, took the stage, the applause came from the other side of the plenary, mostly from the CDU/CSU. Judging by their clapping, many in the FDP still hope to form the next governing coalition with the Conservatives. Small caveat: They will need to get enough votes on February 23rd to make it into parliament first.\n\nDuring his speech in the Bundestag ahead of a confidence motion, Chancellor Olaf Scholz called for the value-added tax (VAT)\u00a0rate on food products to drop from 7% to 5% amid the country's cost of living crisis.\nHe said that he wanted to raise Germany's minimum wage to \u20ac15 ($15.75).\n\"The world did not end when we introduced the minimum wage or when we raised it to \u20ac12,\" he said.\nScholz also called for the availability of daycare facilities to be greater so that more women could work full-time.\nHe pointed to Germany's labor shortage, calling for \"more workers\" and \"more productivity.\"\nScholz said that there was no way to plug the labor shortage without migration.\nHe praised his coalition government's citizenship reform, which allowed for dual\u00a0citizenship and faster naturalization.\n\"One in four of us has a migrant background,\" Scholz said. \"We all make up Germany.\"\nTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video\nChancellor Scholz said Germany needed \"massive investment\" to meet the future, particularly for self-defense.\n\"Today a highly armed nuclear power is waging war in Europe just two hours' flight from here. We must invest massively in our security and defense,\" he said, referencing Russia's invasion of Ukraine.\nAt the same time, he said, he would never \"send German soldiers into that war,\" and not further inflame the conflict, likely a reference to rival Friedrich Merz's desire to send German Taurus missiles to Ukraine should his CDU emerge victorious in February's vote.\nHowever, Scholz said, Germany\u00a0would remain \"Ukraine's strongest supporter in Europe...supporting Ukrainian sovereignty and ending all the death,\" that has come out of the conflict.",

However, new treaties cannot be signed until a new government takes over.\nTomorrow, the opposition Christian Democrats\u00a0are going to\u00a0launch\u00a0their party program.\nThe party is led by Friedrich Merz, who is widely expected to become the next chancellor.\nScholz's Social Democrats also look\u00a0set to launch their\u00a0party program in the afternoon.\nOlaf Scholz did not show enough leadership during his tenure as German chancellor, the Greens'\u00a0parliamentary group leader said on Monday.\n\"The long tugging and wrangling\"\u00a0over some legislative projects would have been avoidable \"if our Chancellor Olaf Scholz had shown more leadership,\"\u00a0Britta Hasselmann said after Monday's vote in the Bundestag.\nThe co-chair of the parliamentary group, Katharina Dr\u00f6ge, said\u00a0the opposition leader Friedrich Merz (CDU) was not ready for the snap election, penciled in for\u00a0February 23.\nAs for policies, Dr\u00f6ge said that the Greens wanted to ensure \"that the 49-euro ticket remains a 49-euro ticket.\"\nThe price of the ticket, which allows the holder to use public transport across many parts of Germany without extra charge, is set to increase to \u20ac58 in January.\nAfter Monday's\u00a0vote of no confidence, Olaf Scholz is no longer the chancellor of Germany as part of a minority coalition, but he does still act as the head of government.\nHowever, both the government and the Bundestag will remain fully functional in terms of global issues\u00a0in the transition phase until a new government is formed.\nWhen Scholz was confirmed as the future chancellor in 2021, his predecessor Angela Merkel, while\u00a0still in office, took the future German leader\u00a0to international appointments, for example with US President Joe Biden.\nThere will likely be a weeks-long transition phase after the parliamentary elections until a new coalition government is agreed upon.\nTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video\nAccording to the latest polls, Friedrich Merz's CDU holds a lead of more than 10 points over Olaf Scholz's SPD, though the advantage\u00a0has been narrowing recently.\nThe polls suggest Merz's CDU\u00a0and its Bavarian sister party, the Christian Social Union (CSU), have a\u00a032%\u00a0share of the vote.\nThe far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD), led by Alice Wiedel,\u00a0is slightly ahead of the SPD, while the Greens are in fourth place.\nThe mainstream parties have refused to govern with the AfD, but its presence complicates the parliamentary arithmetic, making unwieldy coalitions more likely.\nMerz said he wants to see the CDU and the CSU\u00a0be the strongest force in the Bundestag.\n\"We can do that. We are doing well in the polls at the moment,\" he said. \"But not as well as I see and think possible. However, an election campaign comes first from fighting and then from voting.\"\nScholz has traveled\u00a0to Berlin's\u00a0Bellevue Palace and proposed to German President Frank-Walter Steinmeier that the Bundestag be dissolved.\nThe president, Germany's head of state, will then have 21 days to decide whether to agree and to call a new election within 60 days.\nSteinmeier's approval is considered certain and\u00a0he has already indicated that he agrees with the proposed election date of February 23.\nHowever, it is expected that he will wait until after the Christmas holidays to make the decision, particularly as he\u00a0first wants to hold talks with all parliamentary groups\u00a0in the Bundestag.\nOver the weekend, Steinmeier said he would not be hurried into making a decision.\n\"The hectic pace of daily politics and the beat of the media do not now dictate the\u00a0procedure, but the constitution and its rules do,\" the German president told ARD.\nChancellor Olaf Scholz's minority coalition government has lost a confidence vote, paving the way for new elections in February.\nSome 394 lawmakers cast their votes against the government, with 207\u00a0voting in favor.\nAnother 116 abstained, leaving Scholz\u00a0far short of the majority of 367 needed to win.\nThe confidence vote came after the Free Democrats (FDP) left the coalition government with Scholz's center-left Social Democrats (SPD) and the Greens following disputes over the budget.\nTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video\nGermany's Left Party and the left-wing populist Sahra Wagenknecht Alliance (BSW) have accused Chancellor Olaf Scholz (SPD) of failings in economic and foreign policy.\nWagenknecht spoke of the \"inglorious end\" of a government that had noticeably worsened people's lives.\n\"Three years of decline for our country, and you are asking for a four-year extension,\" said Wagenknecht.\nThe co-chair of the Left Party, S\u00f6ren Pellmann, accused Scholz\u00a0of having set in motion the \"most violent arms race\" in light of Russia's war of aggression against Ukraine.\nGermany must \"invest its way out of the crisis.\" Pellmann said, hitting out at tax\u00a0rates\u00a0for top earners: \"This country does not need even richer billionaires.\"\nThe head of the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) party, Alice Weidel, criticized Scholz's government for the state of the German economy.\n\"Your government was in power for just three years. Germans will have to deal with the damage that you caused in this time,\" she said during the debate in the Bundestag.\nWeidel, who is running to become chancellor in next year's election, said that the economy had suffered due to \"massive lacking investment\" in the car industry while \"the chemical industry is fleeing\" due to \"exploding energy costs.\"\nShe also had words for the Greens Vice Chancellor Robert Habeck and the CDU's chancellor candidate Friedrich Merz.\nWeidel accused Habeck of ruining the country and said that Merz would send Taurus missiles to Ukraine. Whoever votes for Merz \"is voting for war,\" the far-right lawmaker said.\nShe also demanded that refugees from the war in Syria be sent home immediately, despite the continued uncertainty in the Middle Eastern country.\nIf German lawmakers decide to withdraw their support from Scholz, he will ask President Frank-Walter Steinmeier to dissolve parliament and call for early elections about seven months sooner than planned.\nTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video\nIn his speech before the Bundestag, former Finance Minister Christian Lindner took\u00a0the opportunity to attack\u00a0the economic policies\u00a0of the German chancellor.\nIn particular, the reduction in VAT on foodstuffs proposed by Scholz is unnecessary, the leader of the business-focused Free Democrats said.\nSuch a step would cost billions of euros but would not secure or create any jobs, he said.\n\"Prince Carnival may hand out candy on Rose\u00a0Monday, but the Federal Republic of Germany must not be governed like this,\" said Lindner, likening the measure\u00a0to a\u00a0German tradition of candy being thrown to crowds from procession floats on the last Monday before Lent.\nLindner said Germany was in a worsening economic crisis and called for a political turnaround to prevent further economic decline.\n\"We must be honest and tell the citizens: Never in history has a society defended its prosperity, its social security and its sense of ecological responsibility by making less effort, by working less, by coming up with fewer ideas and by being less willing to take entrepreneurial risks,\" said Lindner.\nRobert Habeck, Green vice chancellor and economy minister, took the podium shortly after opposition leader Merz called him the \"face of the economic crisis\" in Germany.\nHabeck pointed to other countries in Europe that are currently without a government or being governed by shaky coalitions: France, Belgium, Austria, and the Netherlands. He said this highlighted not only that Germany needed to cease navel-gazing, but that \"a new vote is not a guarantee that a new government will quietly and quickly get to work.\"\nLike Scholz, he blamed the FDP for \"being part of a government while simultaneously trying to destroy it.\"\nHabeck said that Germany needed a government that was \"ready to make compromises,\" which the current coalition did successfully for three years until the FDP decided to sabotage it.\nHe then slammed Merz's accusations that the SPD-led coalition had tanked the economy, citing the effects of the war in Ukraine and how the CDU under former Chancellor Angela Merkel had left Germany reliant on cheap Russian gas.\nThe vice chancellor called Merkels' decision a \"grand historical mistake.\" Energy prices have soared in Germany as the country moved to pivot away from Russian gas quickly in the aftermath of the invasion of Ukraine.\nAlluding mainly to the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD), Habeck said that the \"racism\" of the right-wing in Germany was \"the biggest threat\" to the national economy, because it was keeping skilled migrants away.\nThe leader of the opposition CDU Friedrich Merz accused the ruling coalition of hypocrisy. He\u00a0spoke ahead of a confidence vote over Chancellor Olaf Scholz's government.\n\"The chancellor spoke a lot about respect, but it seems as though his respect ends where other political opinions begin,\" he said, before calling it \"shameless\" to have spoken so highly of his accomplishments but so badly of the FDP, who he said helped him achieve\u00a0all of them.\nHe further asked why, if Scholz foresaw so much room for progress, the SPD hadn't accomplished any of it \"in the 22 years of the last 26\" when it was part of Germany's governing coalitions.\n\"Where were you for the last 22 years?\" he asked.\nMerz went on to criticize the funding of the military, the reaction to record-high inflation and an economic crisis, and Scholz's perceived lack of clarity and outspokenness on global issues over the last several years.\n\"You have brought shame on Germany\" in front of the EU and other allies, Merz said.\nHe also praised the FDP for what he described as trying to prevent the ruling SPD and Greens from raising taxes. Arguments over the national budget played a major role over the collapse of Scholz's coalition.\nReturning to the topic of the economy, Merz also implied that Germans do not work enough, citing neighboring Switzerland as a positive example, where people \"work on average 200 hours more\" a year. The conservative leader said that working more hours was necessary for \"making Germany more competitive.\"\nThese statements were met with loud consternation by other lawmakers.\nThe beginning of Chancellor Olaf Scholz's speech felt like the official kick-off of the election campaign.\nThe political groups in the Bundestag had rallied their troops and coordinated their planned applause for this special session. During Scholz\u2019s address, there was consistent applause only from his SPD group and individual members of the Greens, who form part of his government.\nThe business-friendly FDP, most of whose ministers were ousted by Scholz, kept their hands firmly on their desks.\nScholz highlighted many of Germany\u2019s current weaknesses. Observers on the visitors\u2019 benches made cynical comments, such as \u201cWait till he finds out who\u2019s in charge.\u201d\nWhen Scholz\u2019s strongest opponent, Friedrich Merz of the CDU, took the stage, the applause came from the other side of the plenary, mostly from the CDU/CSU. Judging by their clapping, many in the FDP still hope to form the next governing coalition with the Conservatives. Small caveat: They will need to get enough votes on February 23rd to make it into parliament first.\n\nDuring his speech in the Bundestag ahead of a confidence motion, Chancellor Olaf Scholz called for the value-added tax (VAT)\u00a0rate on food products to drop from 7% to 5% amid the country's cost of living crisis.\nHe said that he wanted to raise Germany's minimum wage to \u20ac15 ($15.75).\n\"The world did not end when we introduced the minimum wage or when we raised it to \u20ac12,\" he said.\nScholz also called for the availability of daycare facilities to be greater so that more women could work full-time.\nHe pointed to Germany's labor shortage, calling for \"more workers\" and \"more productivity.\"\nScholz said that there was no way to plug the labor shortage without migration.\nHe praised his coalition government's citizenship reform, which allowed for dual\u00a0citizenship and faster naturalization.\n\"One in four of us has a migrant background,\" Scholz said. \"We all make up Germany.\"\nTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video\nChancellor Scholz said Germany needed \"massive investment\" to meet the future, particularly for self-defense.\n\"Today a highly armed nuclear power is waging war in Europe just two hours' flight from here. We must invest massively in our security and defense,\" he said, referencing Russia's invasion of Ukraine.\nAt the same time, he said, he would never \"send German soldiers into that war,\" and not further inflame the conflict, likely a reference to rival Friedrich Merz's desire to send German Taurus missiles to Ukraine should his CDU emerge victorious in February's vote.\nHowever, Scholz said, Germany\u00a0would remain \"Ukraine's strongest supporter in Europe...supporting Ukrainian sovereignty and ending all the death,\" that has come out of the conflict.",

The rise of the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) complicates future coalition possibilities, signaling a fragmented political landscape.",
            "content": "Olaf Scholz has been Germany's chancellor since 2021\nGerman Chancellor Olaf Scholz has lost a vote of confidence in parliament, paving the way for early elections on 23 February.\nScholz called Monday's vote and had expected to lose it, but calculated that triggering an early election was his best chance of reviving his party's political fortunes.\nIt comes around two months after the collapse of Scholz's three-party coalition government, which left the embattled chancellor leading a minority administration.\nAhead of Monday's vote, Scholz said it would now be up to voters to \"determine the political course of our country\", teeing up what is likely to be a fiercely fought election campaign.\nLosing Monday's no-confidence vote was the outcome Scholz had wanted.\nThanks to the loss, elections can now happen in February, rather than in September as originally scheduled.\nThere were 207 MPs, mainly from his own party, who voted for Scholz, while 394 voted against him and 116 abstained.\nSince Scholz's argumentative three-party governing coalition collapsed in November, he had been reliant on support from the opposition conservatives to pass any new laws, effectively rendering his administration a lame-duck government.\nGiven Germany's stalled economy and the global crises facing the West, staggering on until the scheduled election date of September 2025 risked being seen as irresponsible by the electorate.\nScholz's Social Democratic Party (SDP) is trailing heavily in opinion polls, while the conservative Christian Democratic Union (CDU) under Friedrich Merz appears to be on course for a return to government.\nOpening the debate ahead of Monday's vote, Scholz said the snap election was an opportunity to set a new course for the country and called for \"massive\" investment, particularly in defence, while Merz said more debt would be a burden for younger generations and promised tax cuts.\nScholz's decision to stage a vote he expected to lose in order to dissolve his own government was described as a \"kamikaze\" move by the German tabloid Bild - but it is generally the only way a German government can dissolve parliament and spark early elections.\nThe process was designed specifically by the post-war founders of modern Germany to avoid the political instability of the Weimar era.\nThis vote of confidence is not a political crisis in itself: it is a standard constitutional mechanism that has been used by modern German chancellors five times to overcome political stalemate - and one Gerhard Schr\u00c3\u00b6der deployed on two occasions.\nHowever, there is a deeper problem within German politics.\nOn the surface, the collapse of the coalition was sparked by a row over money. Scholz's centre-left SDP and his Green partners wanted to ease Germany's strict debt rules to finance support for Ukraine and key infrastructure projects.\nThat was blocked by Scholz's own finance minister, Christian Lindner, who is the leader of the business-friendly liberal Free Democratic Party (FDP), which prioritised driving down the debt.\nLindner was sacked and the coalition collapsed. After years of unedifying bickering, you could almost hear the sigh of relief in Berlin's corridors of power - but the underlying cause is more difficult to resolve and more worrying.\nGermany's party political system has become more fragmented, with more parties than ever in parliament. The new upstart political forces are also more radical.\nIn 2017, the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) entered the Bundestag for the first time, winning 12.6%.\nIn 2021, it slipped to 10.4%, but is now polling at almost 20%.\nGermany engulfed by political crisis as Scholz coalition falls apart\nGermany plans February election after coalition collapse\nThe AfD will not get into government because no-one will work with it to form a coalition. But the far-right is eating into the share of the vote that goes to the two centrist big-tent parties which have always put forward modern German chancellors.\nThe bigger the AfD share is, the more difficult it becomes for mainstream parties to form a stable governing coalition.\nThat was arguably the underlying problem that pulled apart Scholz's fractious coalition: big-spending left-leaning Social Democrats and Greens trying to work with free-market small-state liberals.\nRather than going away after the next election in February, that problem is likely to get worse. If the far-right wins a fifth of seats in parliament, it could be even more difficult after February to form a stable coalition between like-minded parties.\nAnother new populist political party could also get into parliament for the first time, the anti-migrant nativist far-left Sahra Wagenknecht Alliance BSW, which is named after its firebrand leader, who joined the East German Communist party shortly before the fall of the Berlin Wall.\nThe conservatives are leading in the polls, but as things stand their options for coalition partners are limited.\nThey refuse to work with the far-right and it is hard to imagine they would like to work with the radical left either. The free-market liberals may not even get into parliament, and some conservatives refuse to consider the Greens.\nThat leaves Scholz's SDP as a possible partner - even though Scholz is likely to be ousted from power after his stint in power saw his popularity plummet.\nWhatever the next government looks like, the era of cosy consensual coalitions in Germany seems to be over.\nLocals find homes reduced to ash as fears grow of more fierce winds spreading LA fires\nClimate 'whiplash' linked to raging LA fires\nWatch: The moment five US presidents gather at Jimmy Carter's funeral\nThe '9/11 mastermind' is set to plead guilty.

That left him far short of the majority of 367 needed to win.\nThe elections for a new parliament will take place on February 23.\nThe governing coalition, which had consisted of three political parties, was shaken when Scholz fired Finance Minister\u00a0Christian Lindner in November.\nLindner\u2019s pro-business Free Democrats then quit the coalition government, robbing Scholz of a majority in parliament.\nScholz\u2019s centre-left Social Democrats (SPD) and the Greens will continue running the country without parliamentary backing until a new government is formed.\nMonday\u2019s move came after months of infighting over fiscal priorities and debt spending.\nEarlier this month, a hung parliament in neighbouring France toppled the country\u2019s prime minister with no confidence vote.\nThe crisis in France prompted President Emanuel Macron to name centrist politician Francois Bayrou as new prime minister without triggering a new election. But it highlighted the intensifying political rifts in EU countries amid economic uncertainty and the war in Ukraine.\n\n\n\nIn Germany, Scholz \u2013 who previously served as mayor of Hamburg and finance minister before becoming the head of a new government in 2021 \u2013 accused the Free Democrats of wanting to block investment in the country.\nSeen as a continuity candidate when he took over from Angela Merkel three years ago, he hasframed next year\u2019s election as an opportunity for voters to set a new course, casting the vote as a choice between a future of growth versus one of austerity.\nIf he is given a second term, Scholz said he would invest heavily in Germany\u2019s creaking infrastructure and would not make the spending cuts he said the conservatives want.\nScholz and the leader of the conservative Christian Democratic Union, Friedrich Merz, who polls suggest is likely to be the next chancellor, clashed in a debate before Monday\u2019s vote, accusing each other of incompetence.\n\u201cShortsightedness might save money in the short term, but the mortgage on our future is unaffordable,\u201d Scholz told lawmakers.\nMerz told Scholz that his spending plans would burden future generations and accused the chancellor of failing to deliver on promises of rearmament since Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine.\nThe conservative leader has been a vocal backer of giving Ukraine German-made Taurus missiles, which could be used to strike targets inside Russia.\nScholz, by contrast, has refused to supply them to Kyiv, suggesting that such moves could plunge Berlin into a fiercer conflict with with Moscow.\nBoth Scholz and Merz are staunch supporters of Israel. Germany is one of the top suppliers of weapons to Israel, which has been accused by rights groups of carrying out a genocide in Gaza.\n\n\n\nAhead of the February vote, the conservatives have a comfortable, albeit narrowing lead of more than 10 percentage points over the SPD in most polls.\nThe far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) is slightly ahead of Scholz\u2019s party while the Greens are in fourth place.\nThe mainstream parties have refused to govern with the AfD, but its presence complicates parliamentary politics, making unwieldy three-way coalitions like Scholz\u2019s more likely.\nMeanwhile, the chancellor has outlined a list of urgent measures that he could pass before the elections, including 11 billion euros ($11.6bn) of tax cuts and an increase in child benefits.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFollow Al Jazeera English:",

The vote followed the collapse of his three-party coalition, resulting in a minority government. Scholz aimed to rejuvenate his party's fortunes amid economic challenges and rising support for the opposition Christian Democratic Union (CDU). The vote underscores deeper political fragmentation in Germany, with rising far-right influence from the Alternative for Germany (AfD) complicating coalition formations. Scholz's party, the Social Democrats (SDP), is trailing in polls, indicating a challenging political landscape ahead.",
            "content": "German Chancellor Olaf Scholz has lost a vote of confidence in parliament, paving the way for early elections on 23 February.\nScholz called Monday's vote and had expected to lose it, but calculated that triggering an early election was his best chance of reviving his party's political fortunes.\nIt comes around two months after the collapse of Scholz's three-party coalition government, which left the embattled chancellor leading a minority administration.\nAhead of Monday's vote, Scholz said it would now be up to voters to \"determine the political course of our country\", teeing up what is likely to be a fiercely fought election campaign.\nLosing Monday's no-confidence vote was the outcome Scholz had wanted.\nThanks to the loss, elections can now happen in February, rather than in September as originally scheduled.\nThere were 207 MPs, mainly from his own party, who voted for Scholz, while 394 voted against him and 116 abstained.\nSince Scholz's argumentative three-party governing coalition collapsed in November, he had been reliant on support from the opposition conservatives to pass any new laws, effectively rendering his administration a lame-duck government.\nGiven Germany's stalled economy and the global crises facing the West, staggering on until the scheduled election date of September 2025 risked being seen as irresponsible by the electorate.\nScholz's Social Democratic Party (SDP) is trailing heavily in opinion polls, while the conservative Christian Democratic Union (CDU) under Friedrich Merz appears to be on course for a return to government.\nOpening the debate ahead of Monday's vote, Scholz said the snap election was an opportunity to set a new course for the country and called for \"massive\" investment, particularly in defence, while Merz said more debt would be a burden for younger generations and promised tax cuts.\nScholz's decision to stage a vote he expected to lose in order to dissolve his own government was described as a \"kamikaze\" move by the German tabloid Bild - but it is generally the only way a German government can dissolve parliament and spark early elections.\nThe process was designed specifically by the post-war founders of modern Germany to avoid the political instability of the Weimar era.\nThis vote of confidence is not a political crisis in itself: it is a standard constitutional mechanism that has been used by modern German chancellors five times to overcome political stalemate - and one Gerhard Schr\u00f6der deployed on two occasions.\nHowever, there is a deeper problem within German politics.\nOn the surface, the collapse of the coalition was sparked by a row over money. Scholz's centre-left SDP and his Green partners wanted to ease Germany's strict debt rules to finance support for Ukraine and key infrastructure projects.\nThat was blocked by Scholz's own finance minister, Christian Lindner, who is the leader of the business-friendly liberal Free Democratic Party (FDP), which prioritised driving down the debt.\nLindner was sacked and the coalition collapsed. After years of unedifying bickering, you could almost hear the sigh of relief in Berlin's corridors of power - but the underlying cause is more difficult to resolve and more worrying.\nGermany's party political system has become more fragmented, with more parties than ever in parliament. The new upstart political forces are also more radical.\nIn 2017, the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) entered the Bundestag for the first time, winning 12.6%.\nIn 2021, it slipped to 10.4%, but is now polling at almost 20%.\nThe AfD will not get into government because no-one will work with it to form a coalition. But the far-right is eating into the share of the vote that goes to the two centrist big-tent parties which have always put forward modern German chancellors.\nThe bigger the AfD share is, the more difficult it becomes for mainstream parties to form a stable governing coalition.\nThat was arguably the underlying problem that pulled apart Scholz's fractious coalition: big-spending left-leaning Social Democrats and Greens trying to work with free-market small-state liberals.\nRather than going away after the next election in February, that problem is likely to get worse. If the far-right wins a fifth of seats in parliament, it could be even more difficult after February to form a stable coalition between like-minded parties.\nAnother new populist political party could also get into parliament for the first time, the anti-migrant nativist far-left Sahra Wagenknecht Alliance BSW, which is named after its firebrand leader, who joined the East German Communist party shortly before the fall of the Berlin Wall.\nThe conservatives are leading in the polls, but as things stand their options for coalition partners are limited.\nThey refuse to work with the far-right and it is hard to imagine they would like to work with the radical left either. The free-market liberals may not even get into parliament, and some conservatives refuse to consider the Greens.\nThat leaves Scholz's SDP as a possible partner - even though Scholz is likely to be ousted from power after his stint in power saw his popularity plummet.\nWhatever the next government looks like, the era of cosy consensual coalitions in Germany seems to be over.\nAlthough some of Europe's leaders have found favour with the billionaire, others are worried by his interventions.\nA 52-year-old woman has died in hospital from her injuries two weeks after the attack.\nThere is deep sadness in the city - and also anger directed at the government and migrants.\nThe attack killed five people, including a nine-year-old child, and left more than 200 injured.\nAndr\u00e9 Gleissner was a member of a nearby children's fire brigade, a local fire department said.\nCopyright 2025 BBC.

An election would follow within another 60 days.\nUltimately, the decision on when to hold the election rests with Steinmeier. But after the heads of parliament\u2019s major groupings had agreed to hold a federal election on Sunday, Feb. 23, 2025, Steinmeier is widely expected to follow that timetable.\nThe last time a German chancellor lost a vote of confidence was in 2005 under then SPD Chancellor Gerhard Schr\u00f6der, after which the CDU\u2019s Angela Merkel came to lead Germany \u2014 and continued to do so for the following 16 years.\nChancellor Olaf Scholz\u2019s latest demand is likely to stall a \u20ac3 billion aid package to the war-ravaged country as Russian forces continue their advance.\n\u201cThe objective exchange of arguments is becoming increasingly difficult\u201d on the platform formerly known as Twitter, says defense ministry.\nThe EU\u2019s strategy to deal with the far-right Freedom Party heading for power in Vienna is \u2026 hope for the best.\nConservative chancellor candidate Friedrich Merz railed against the climate policies of the left-leaning parties he\u2019ll likely have to govern with.",

The far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) is second at 19 percent, and Scholz\u2019s center-left Social Democratic Party (SPD) is third at 17 percent.\nMerz has drawn his Christian Democratic Union (CDU) sharply to the right on issues like migration and energy. Should he and his conservatives win the election, it could mark Germany\u2019s sharpest swerve to the right in decades, though that shift is likely be be somewhat moderated by the likely participation of at least one center-left party in the next coalition.\nSteinmeier\u2019s move to dissolve parliament was another step in a highly choreographed process leading to the February election, which German leaders agreed would take place shortly after the coalition collapse in November. That collapse led to a December confidence vote, which the chancellor, as expected, lost.\nGermany\u2019s constitution, which was designed to prevent the kind of political tumult that helped enable to rise of the Nazis during the Weimar Republic, contains a series of provisions intended to make the unraveling of a government as stable and orderly as possible.

Scholz has returned fire, at one point referring to Merz as \u201cLittle Fritz.\u201d\nAn attack on a Christmas market in Magdeburg that killed five people and injured scores more has also turned up the heat as revelations over a series of apparent security failures surfaced. The alleged attacker was a refugee from Saudi Arabia who authorities say had \u201cIslamophobic\u201d beliefs and made little secret of his potentially violent intentions in online posts.\nThe far-right AfD, now polling in second place, has seized on the attack to drive home its anti-immigration message, though the alleged attacker is reported to have sympathized with the party and to have embraced some far-right conspiracy theories.\n\u201cWe want something to finally change in our country, so we can finally live in safety again,\u201d Alice Weidel, the AfD\u2019s chancellor candidate declared at a rally in Magdeburg after the attack.\nPreceding the attack, Germans cited the economy as the most important issue ahead of the election, according to a\u00a0poll for public television, followed by migration. Russia\u2019s war on Ukraine was fourth on the list.\nGermans have become increasingly worried about their country\u2019s ailing economy, which is set to\u00a0contract for the second year\u00a0in a row, amid a steady drumbeat of bad economic news and announced layoffs.\nThe AfD is using Elon Musk\u2019s endorsement to reach out to Donald Trump \u2014 and to appear more acceptable at home ahead of a national election.\nThe \u201cchameleon\u201d tech billionaire is one of the most powerful politically connected people in the world. Europe\u2019s governments are still working out how to deal with being on his bad side.\nThe conservative leader\u2019s attacks signal the next government may be just as discordant as the one that recently fell.\nFriedrich Merz wants to make Germany great again, but his country is confronting global risks beyond the control of any domestic leader.",

            "content": "Germany's ex-Chancellor Angela Merkel backed her record on refugees, Russia and the economy as she presented her new memoir in Berlin. Critics have said that the 700-page tome is light on new insights.\nAngela Merkel, the longest-serving chancellor of a unified postwar Germany, was back in the spotlight on Tuesday evening. The\u00a0Deutsches Theater in Berlin was the first port of call on Merkel's multi-continent tour to promote her autobiography\u00a0Freedom. Memories 1954-2021.\nOn stage, Merkel was given\u00a0the opportunity to defend her more controversial decisions. When pushed by journalist Anne Will to respond to critique that she was soft on Russia in exchange for cheap natural gas, that she did too little to address climate change or\u00a0to fund the Bundeswehr, she pushed back by saying that many of those things were not solely in her control.\nShe also rejected accusations that she \"skimped Germany into destruction\" with her Christian Democratic (CDU) party's focus on saving money over spending it on, for example, aging infrastructure like the beleaguered\u00a0national rail service Deutsche Bahn.\nWill also questioned Merkel\u00a0about her 2015 decision to eschew certain European Union statutes that require refugees to be processed in the first EU country in which they arrive, instead welcoming asylum seekers from countries like Syria, Iraq, and Afghanistan unequivocally.\n\"The alternative was to turn people away,\" perhaps violently, from the German border, \"which for me, was so much worse,\" Merkel said.\nTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video\nAs in her book, the former chancellor largely evaded the question of being too conciliatory towards Russia, particularly after the annexation of Crimea in 2014, in order to procure cheap fuel for Germany.\nShe writes however\u00a0that by accepting Ukraine's bid to join NATO, the West was sending a strong signal\u00a0to the Kremlin.\nRussian President Vladimir Putin, however, features perhaps more prominently than any other leader in the book. She recalls him as someone who was \"always ready to disrespect others,\" particularly by showing up late.\n\"Probably his greatest joy\u00a0was that the American president had to wait for him,\" she writes of Putin's behavior towards Barack Obama, who garners nearly as much attention in her memoir as the Russian president.\nShe describes\u00a0the former US president glowingly, saying she knew right away \"he was someone I could work well with.\" She also appears to accept without question his assertion that he had no personal knowledge that the National Security Agency (NSA) was spying on her personal mobile phone when that information came to light in 2015.\nIn one of the rare unknown insights the book offers, she reveals that Obama was one of the confidantes she sought advice from when deciding whether to run for a fourth term in 2017.\nTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video\nAs for US President-elect Donald Trump, she found him to be one person in front of cameras and another entirely when they were alone. In public, he refused to shake her hand and \"claimed that I had ruined Germany by taking in so many refugees in 2015 and 2016, accused us of spending too little on defense and criticized us for unfair trade practices.\"\nMerkel says that he acted \"as if Germany owed him and America something,\" but was uninterested in finding common ground or working on solutions.\nBehind closed doors, however, he had greeted her appropriately and\u00a0appeared to \"want to like whoever he was talking to.\"\nAnalysts have pointed out that despite its 740-page heft, the book offers little in the way of self-reflection or indeed, little\u00a0information at all that isn't already well known.\nThe book\u00a0is also noticeably light on several topics, such as religion. Despite being the daughter of a pastor, Merkel doesn't speak much about Christian faith. There are a few scattered mentions of Islam, almost exclusively in connection with extremism and terrorism. Also hardly mentioned at length are non-Western world leaders, such as Narendra Modi or Xi Jinping and his predecessor Hu Jintao.\nAt the book launch, she\u00a0did not take questions from the audience. She admitted towards the end, however, that she \"did not leave the country in perfect\u00a0condition,\" in terms of climate protection and digitalization.\nNext, the former chancellor will head to other major European cities to promote her work and then to Washington, where Obama is expected to be on hand to support her.\nAdditional reporting by Christoph Strack",

No matter how carefree a day began, everything could change in a matter of seconds\" if someone around her stepped out of line.\n\"The state knew no mercy,\" she writes, adding that realizing what lines could not be crossed was an important skill, even for a child. \"My pragmatic approach helped me\" in that regard, she says.\nThe ex-chancellor writes that despite the GDR's attempts to totally control its citizens, she maintained her carefree attitude and would come to disdain the \"pettiness, narrow-mindedness, tasteless and...humorlessness\" of the East German regime.\nIn Germany's 2005 federal election, Merkel was selected to represent the center-right CDU/CSU bloc over, among others, current CDU leader Friedrich Merz.\nShe says\u00a0she found \"a difference between theory and practice\" in the acceptance of a female candidate for head of government. \"There were doubts about this\" she writes, even \"deep within the ranks of women\" in her party.\nMerkel then explains\u00a0the challenge of going up against then-Chancellor Gerhard Schr\u00f6der and his reputation for being \"energetic and smart.\"\n\"Any man who challenged the chancellor...would have felt the same way. But being a woman, I felt, was definitely not an advantage.\"\nTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video\nIn an excerpt on meeting Russian President Vladimir\u00a0Putin at the 2007 Munich Security Conference, Merkel says Putin presented himself as\u00a0\"someone who was always on his guard, not to be trifled with, and always ready to dish it out.\"\nShe confirms a famous story that Putin brought his large Labrador to a private meeting with her. It is well-known that an earlier incident left Merkel with a phobia of dogs, but Putin has denied doing it on purpose to intimidate her.\nShe also says he regularly arrived late for the purpose of making people wait.\n\"You could find all this childish, reprehensible, you could shake your head at it,\" but that didn't make Russia any less important on the world stage, the ex-chancellor says. She goes on to describe him as singularly preoccupied with the United States, as if longing for the days of the Cold War.\nMerkel also sheds some light on her infamous first meeting with US President Donald Trump in 2017. An incident went viral on social media in which Merkel appeared\u00a0to ask Trump to shake hands for a photo, and he ignored her.\nTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video\nShe writes that he appeared to not understand her request, and then pelted her with questions about growing up under a dictatorship.\nHe was interested in\u00a0\"my East German background and my relationship with Putin. He was clearly very fascinated by the Russian president,\" Merkel says, adding:\u00a0\"In the years that followed, I had the impression that has was captivated by politicians with autocratic and dictatorial tendencies.\"\nShe asserts that Trump\u00a0spent the rest of their first meeting criticizing her.\n\"He claimed that I had ruined Germany by taking in so many refugees in 2015 and 2016, accused us of spending too little on defense and criticized us for unfair trade practices,\" according to Merkel.\nMerkel suggests that Trump saw everything through the eyes of a real estate mogul, and did not appear to understand the intertwined global economy, complaining about German cars on New York City streets.\n\"We were talking on two different levels,\u00a0Trump on the emotional level, me on the factual level. When he did pay attention to my arguments, it was mostly just to turn them into new accusations,\" she says. \"Resolving the issues raised did not appear to be his goal.\"\nIn the book, Merkel admits to being hesitant to accelerate Kyiv's bid to join NATO.\nShe\u00a0describes a 2008 NATO summit in Bucharest, where Ukraine\u00a0and Georgia's applications\u00a0to join the alliance were on the agenda.\nMerkel notes her\u00a0concerns over Kyiv's relationship with\u00a0Russia, although then-Ukrainian President\u00a0Viktor Yushchenko had sought closer ties to Europe. She also claims that at the time, only a minority of Ukrainians supported NATO membership, stressing the need for new NATO states\u00a0to add to the overall security for all members.\nMerkel has faced criticism from Ukrainians for being too hands-off in her approach to their country. She writes, however, that allowing Ukraine's membership bid to stand was a clear signal to Putin as to where the West stood.\nEdited by: Sean M.

            "summary": "Former German Chancellor Angela Merkel defended her tenure in an interview with the BBC, stating that her gas deals with Russia aimed to support German businesses and maintain peace. She argued that the Ukraine war would have started earlier if she hadn't blocked Ukraine's NATO membership in 2008. Merkel expressed concerns over Russia's nuclear threats and highlighted the need for European leaders to invest in Africa to reduce migration. She acknowledged criticisms of her legacy, particularly regarding energy dependence on Russia and the rise of the far-right in Germany, but maintained that her decisions were made in the context of her time.",
            "content": "Former German Chancellor Angela Merkel has told the BBC the gas deals she made with Russia were intended to help German firms and kept the peace with Moscow.\nShe also insisted the war with Ukraine would have started earlier if she hadn\u2019t blocked Kyiv\u2019s entry into Nato in 2008.\nAngela Merkel led Germany for 16 years. She was in office during the financial crisis, the 2015 migrant crisis and, significantly, Russia\u2019s 2014 invasion of Ukraine.\nWas she too soft on Moscow? Too slow to help Kyiv? If she hadn't blocked Ukraine\u2019s Nato membership in 2008, would there be a war there now?\nSpeaking to the BBC in Berlin, Mrs Merkel is robust in her defence of her time in office.\nShe says she believes the war in Ukraine would have started sooner and  would likely have been worse, if Kyiv had begun the path to Nato membership in 2008.\n\"We would have seen military conflict even earlier. It was completely clear to me that President Putin would not have stood idly by and watched Ukraine join Nato.\n\"And back then, Ukraine as a country would certainly not have been as prepared as it was in February 2022.\"\nUkraine President Volodymyr Zelensky disagrees.\nHe describes Mrs Merkel\u2019s Nato decision, backed by then-French President Nicolas Sarkozy, as a clear \"miscalculation\" that emboldened Russia.\nIn a rare interview since she stepped down from politics three years ago, Mrs Merkel expresses concern about Vladimir Putin\u2019s renewed threats of using nuclear weapons.\nThe two leaders got to know each other well over the course of two decades.\n\"We must do everything possible to prevent the use of nuclear weapons,\u201d the former German Chancellor says.\n\"Thankfully, China also spoke about this a while back. We shouldn't be paralysed by fear, but we must also acknowledge that Russia is the biggest, or alongside the US, one of the two biggest nuclear powers in the world.\n\"The potential is frightening.\"\nDespite enjoying high popularity ratings during most of her time in office, Mrs Merkel now finds herself on the defensive.\nShe has just published her memoir, Freedom. And the timing is interesting.\nShe says she did everything in her power to ensure peaceful means of co-operation with Russia.\nIn fact, Mr Putin launched his full-scale invasion of Ukraine just months after she left office.\nThis prompted a thorough re-examination in Europe of energy policies, diplomacy with Russia and also migration policies that had become the norm under Mrs Merkel.\nAt the helm of Europe\u2019s biggest economy, she was, as former Italian premier Matteo Renzi says, the de-facto leader of Europe - \"the boss of the European Union\".\n\"Do you remember when [former US Secretary of State] Henry Kissinger used to say 'what is the telephone number of Europe?',\" he says. \"My answer was: clearly, the mobile number of Angela Merkel.\"\nHe adds that when judging the Merkel legacy - over Russia and otherwise - it is important to remember the norms of the time.\n\"One cannot attack Angela for the relations with Russia,\" he says.\n\"In 2005, 2006 [they] were a goal of everyone in Europe, not only a goal of Angela Merkel.\"\nUnder Mrs Merkel, Germany and its energy-hungry big industries became dependent on Moscow. Germany built two gas pipelines directly linked to Russia.\nPresident Zelensky described that cheap gas as a geopolitical tool of the Kremlin.\nMrs Merkel tells the BBC she had two motives with the pipelines: German business interests but also maintaining peaceful links with Russia.\nFellow EU and Nato members in eastern Europe strongly disagreed with her.\nThe Polish MP, Radoslaw Fogiel, said German gas money filled Russia\u2019s war chest -  used to fund the invasion of Ukraine.\nMrs Merkel insists she tried to curb Russian attacks on Ukraine using diplomacy and negotiations, which - she admits - ultimately failed.\nAnd German industry has been disproportionately hit by sanctions on Russian energy. Forced to look for other suppliers, the country is now buying expensive LNG. Businesses says they are crippled by the costs.\nA new era in Europe\u2019s relations with Russia \"regrettably\" began following the full-scale invasion of Ukraine, says Mrs Merkel.\nOn Monday, defence ministers from the UK, France, Germany, Poland and Italy are meeting to discuss the deteriorating situation on Ukraine\u2019s frontlines.\nMs Merkel, 70, now finds herself having to defend her legacy in other areas too.\nThe migration crisis of 2015, when she famously opened Germany\u2019s doors to over a million asylum seekers, was perhaps the defining moment of her time in office.\nIt was hated by some, hailed by others.\nUS President Barack Obama praised her as a courageous and moral leader.\nBut critics blamed her for breathing life into the then almost redundant far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) party.\nIt is now polling comfortably in second place in German public opinion polls, ahead of a snap general election early next year.\nThe AfD\u2019s main political rallying cry: a strong anti-migrant message.\nAngela Merkel admits the AfD made big gains, but she makes no apology for her political decisions.\nAs for suggestions that her 2015 policies helped fuel anti-immigration and far-right parties elsewhere too, including the Netherlands, Poland and France, after she tried to impose migrant quotas across EU countries, Mrs Merkel says she can\u2019t be held responsible for all of Europe.\nThe only way to combat the far right is to stop illegal migration, she says.\nShe calls on Europe\u2019s leaders to invest more in African nations to improve standards of living there, so fewer people will be tempted to leave their homes.\nBut with Europe\u2019s economies sluggish, and voters worried about the cost of living, governments say there is little cash to spare.\nAngela Merkel appeared to put her country and its economic interests first when it came to buying Russian energy or during the eurozone crisis - when southern EU nations blamed her for squeezing them with austerity measures in order to rescue German banks and businesses.\nBut even at home in Germany, she is now accused of simply \"managing\" successive crises and failing to make far-reaching, perhaps painful reforms to future-proof her country and the EU.\nGermany is now labelled by some as \"the sick man of Europe\".\nOnce an export powerhouse on the world stage, its economy hovers just above recession.\nVoters complain she failed to invest in roads, railways and digitalisation, in favour of maintaining a balanced budget.\nUnder Angela Merkel, Germany not only became reliant on Russia for energy, but on China and the US for trade. Those decisions have not stood the test of time.\nDonald Trump threatens punishing tariffs on imports when he returns to the White House in January.\nMrs Merkel does have some thoughts for Europe\u2019s nervous leaders faced with  Trump 2.0.\nHis first term in office was marked by anger at Europe, particularly Germany, over low defence spending and trade deficits. Those gripes with Europe haven't changed.\nWhat are the Merkel tips for handling him?\n\"It\u2019s really important to know what your priorities are, to present them clearly and not to be scared, because Donald Trump can be very outspoken,\" she says.\n\"He expresses himself very clearly. And if you do that, there is a certain mutual respect. That was my experience anyway.\"\nBut Europe\u2019s leaders facing the US, China, and Russia, are apprehensive - arguably more so than during Angela Merkel\u2019s time.\nEconomies are sluggish, voters unhappy, traditional politics under pressure from the far-right and the far-left.\nChina and Russia are more bullish, the West weaker on the world stage.\nWars burn in the Middle East and in Europe, with Donald Trump appearing less interested in bolstering European security.\nPerhaps that\u2019s why Angela Merkel says, these days, when world leaders she knows well call her for advice, she happily responds.\nBut when I ask if she misses all that power and politics, her swift answer is: \"No, not at all.\"\nIn the UK, you can watch Katya Adler's full interview with Angela Merkel on BBC iPlayer.\nSome have long called for the practice of changing the clock twice a year to end.\nAs Argentina's libertarian President Javier Milei marks one year in office, his policies are keenly observed in the US.\nChina's ambassador is expected to attend and other officials may join him, two people told the BBC's US partner CBS.\nThe US president-elect comes into office with a strong economy, but investors hope for more and current highs may be difficult to sustain.\nThe incoming US president has vowed not to involve America in foreign conflicts, but Assad's dramatic fall has upended the region's balance of power.\nCopyright 2024 BBC.

Sahra Wagenknecht's party, only formed this year, frequently campaigns on such issues.\nSahra Wagenknecht, the leader of the new left-wing BSW party named after her, lamented a \"dramatic increase in old-age poverty\" in an interview with the German dpa news agency published on Saturday.\nThe BSW had issued a formal request for information to the European Union's statistical agency Eurostat, which found that around 3.2 million people aged 65 or over in Germany were at risk of poverty.\nEurostat's data suggests roughly one in six pensioners in the country fall into the category.\nThe figure had risen slightly in 2023, to 3.245 million, from 3.157 million the previous year. But in 2021, amid the inflationary pressure following the COVID pandemic, it had stood at 3.3 million.\nBack in 2013, only 2.4 million were at risk of poverty, with Eurostat's definition of this being if a pensioner's total income, including benefits, is less than 60% of the national median income.\nHowever, demographic changes in Germany and its aging population play a significant role in this increase, with the pensioner population increasing by more than 50% since 1991, from 12 million to 18.7 million by 2022.\nTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video\n\"Pensioner poverty even affects the middle class in the meantime,\" Wagenknecht, who formally split from the socialist Left Party and formed the new party in January,\u00a0told dpa on Saturday.\nShe claimed that neither Chancellor Olaf Scholz, also a former finance minister, nor his CDU challenger Friedrich Merz had an answer to the issue.\nWith a view to snap elections in February in Germany, Wagenknecht said good pensions were a \"focal point\" for her BSW.\nHer party frequently addresses such issues. Last month, it requested data from the German statistical office on the number of individuals aged 65 and over who required welfare payments to supplement their pensions in Germany.\nAlmost 730,000 people did so in the second quarter of 2024, Destatis found, again with a fairly sharp rise over the last 10 or so years amid the expanding pensioner population.\nWagenknecht also appeared in the publications of Germany's RND newspaper group on Saturday, again arguing for action to reduce living costs.\nIn this case, she was calling for more legislation in the Bundestag before February's elections, but this time not from the remaining minority government but rather led by the opposition.\nTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video\nShe said there would be a parliamentary majority to repeal contentious\u00a0new laws on heating prices implemented earlier in the government's term.\nShe called the heating legislation one of the \"most illogical and in the long term expensive for citizens\" of the past three years.\n\"It doesn't protect the climate, but rather stands for the imposition of the state, wanting to govern right the way into our citizens' heating cellars,\" she told the newspapers.\nWagenknecht and the BSW are also\u00a0 strapped for cash themselves,\u00a0particularly now that the election date has been brought forward.\nWhile the new party would in theory now qualify for state campaign funding assistance for the next federal elections, having secured representation in the European Parliament and some state parliaments since its formation in January, party officials say the funds won't practically be available until 2025 and will therefore not flow in time.\nParty treasurer Ralph Suikat said on Friday that the BSW was seeking either donations from supporters, which it says it would repay in 2025, or if necessary more formal loans.

Despite budget cuts and skepticism about foreign projects, Schulze aims to enhance development assistance, focusing on gender equality, with a goal for 93% of projects to promote it by 2025.

            "content": "German Development Minister Svenja Schulze sees new potential for Germany's involvement in Syria. And finds herself defending her projects against criticism, including from right-wing extremists.\nSvenja Schulze, the German development minister of the center-left Social Democratic Party (SPD), had scheduled a press conference in Berlin to speak about the last three extremely difficult years for her ministry: During this time, the projects she has been working on around the world had come under constant attack. Especially from right-wing populists who have been gaining ground in Germany and who often express nothing but hatred and derision for anyone offering support to the poor in the global South.\nBut given the very urgent situation in Syria, the SPD politician took the opportunity to talk about the new potential she sees for Germany's involvement there. In the years since the start of the Syrian civil war in 2011, German development assistance to the country has fallen to currently \u20ac125 million ($132 million).\nThat money was used to support United Nations projects, such as providing drinking water to Aleppo. In other words, the basic necessities on the smallest level, more was simply not possible because of the constant fighting in the country.\nBut now Schulze wants to do more. \"The Development Ministry has been preparing for this moment for 13 years. Building state structures is our core business,\u201d she said.\nTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video\nBut it was this core business that was repeatedly criticized during the almost three years in which the coalition government of SPD, environmentalist Greens, and neoliberal Free Democrats (FDP)were in power.\nDuring negotiations on the 2025 budget, Schulze only just managed to secure \u20ac10.3 billion for her ministry, almost a billion euros less than in 2024. There had been repeated claims that Germany could no longer afford expensive projects abroad at a time when housing is becoming scarce and infrastructure is crumbling at home.\nFollowing the collapse of the coalition, the budget remains unresolved, but it seems unlikely that the Development Ministry will receive more money in the future. Still clearly outraged, Schulze said: \"What was new was the intensity of the criticism and the deliberate spreading of falsehoods. We saw a perfect example of this with the now famed bike paths in Peru.\"\nThe Alternative for Germany (AfD), a party with some far-right extremist factions, had claimed that Schulze was spending a whopping \u20ac315 million on new cycle paths in the Latin American country. In fact, it was only around 20 million euros in grants and a further 40 million euros in loans \u2014\u00a0money that will be paid back. Schulze has now added the information that German companies were also involved in the construction of the bike paths, which were used as a means of connecting to the metro system. Because German companies were involved, the project was also of benefit to the German economy.\nTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video\nAccording to Schulze, the projects in Peru are a good example of the principles on which she bases her development cooperation: In an increasingly multipolar world, she said, support for poorer countries must be given on an equal footing, otherwise many countries will turn to Russia or China, which often cooperate on the basis of geopolitical interests: \"The countries of Asia, Africa, and Latin America are rightly becoming increasingly self-confident. They choose their partners. And it is our task to remain a strong partner in this new, multipolar world.\"\nAccording to the minister, another priority over the past three years has been the attempt to develop projects that are more strongly feminist in their approach. And this is another issue for which the ministry has repeatedly been criticized. Schulze announced a goal that by 2025, at least 93% of all projects approved will be designed to promote gender equality. In 2022, this was only the case for 66% of projects, whereas in 2024 it rose to around 91%.\nThe Development Policy Report is published once per legislative period and primarily serves to provide the Bundestag with an overview of development policy. Despite all of her efforts, it remains uncertain whether the SPD politician Schulze will be able to continue her work. Now that the FDP has left the government, the Social Democrats and the Greens are governing as a minority government.\nAnd a new Bundestag will be elected on February 23. Svenja Schulze's party, the SPD, is currently far behind the conservatives in the polls.\nThis article was originally written in German.\nWhile you're here: Every Tuesday, DW editors round up what is happening in German politics and society.

Although renewable energy expansion has improved, significant targets, such as electric vehicle goals, are likely to be missed. The political crisis may impact Germany's role in international climate negotiations as it prepares for an upcoming election.",
            "content": "Germany has long been regarded as a leader on climate action, but the outgoing coalition leaves a mixed legacy.\nWhen Germany's coalition took office three years ago, each party came with its own ideas of how to cut the nation's emissions. Negotiations led to what was regarded as an ambitious compromise.\nAt the time,\u00a0Robert Habeck, the\u00a0Green Party economy and climate minister, said the agreement would \"accelerate the transition to renewable energy, restructure industry and finally put us on the 1.5-degree-Celsius [2.7 F]\u00a0path,\" referring to the warming threshold\u00a0set out in the Paris climate accord.\nBut the\u00a0recent implosion of the coalition government\u00a0\u2014 made up of Chancellor Olaf Scholz's center-left Social Democrats, the Greens and neoliberal Free Democrats \u2014 partly because of climate policy, has set the country on a different path.\nWith the SPD and Greens now leading the minority government until the February election, what has the coalition government achieved in terms of climate action?\nJust nine out of 27 planned climate and environment laws have been implemented by the SPD-led government. One law that did make it onto the books, despite fierce opposition from the public and the FDP, was the Building Energy Act. It aims for a\u00a0gradual increase in the number of homes and buildings heated with renewable energy, and for 6 million oil and gas\u00a0heating systems to be replaced with heat pumps by 2030.\n\"The law is better than its reputation, but disastrous in terms of how it was communicated,\" said Claudia Kemfert, an energy economist with economic think tank DIW Berlin. But with only some 1.8 million new heat pumps installed, the country is lagging far behind the target, she added.\nThe legislative process for other potential laws, such as implementing climate-resilient forestry practices, tax breaks for electric company cars and stronger marine protection, barely made it out of the starting block, if at all. And the promised \"climate bonus\" \u2014 financial relief\u00a0to compensate for increases in the national CO2 price implemented in the heating and transport sectors \u2014 never made it to consumers.\nThat's because a constitutional court ruling last year\u00a0enforcing Germany's limits on debt left a gaping \u20ac60 billion chasm in the federal finances, forcing the coalition to cut or halt investments in climate and infrastructure initiatives.\nMeanwhile, German environmental NGO BUND is taking legal action against the Federal Climate Action Act \u2014 meant to be the foundation of the country's climate policy \u2014 because it says the law is insufficient.\nThe act, amended in summer 2023 after a long dispute, brings forward Germany's aim of being climate neutral to 2045 instead of 2050. The country also aims to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions by 65% instead of 55% this decade.\n\"Germany is absolutely not on a 1.5-degree path, because we have climate targets that do not do justice to the state of scientific knowledge,\" said Tina L\u00f6ffelsend, climate expert at BUND.\nTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video\nAn analysis by NGO Climate Action Tracker said the law weakens Germany's climate policies and will make it almost impossible to achieve net zero by 2045. The amendment abolished binding annual goals for emissions cuts in individual sectors like transport, building, energy and agriculture in favor of an overall target, according to the independent scientific project that tracks government climate policies.\nThe change takes pressure off individual ministries like transport and building, which consistently miss their emissions targets.\nBut Dirk Messner, head of Germany's Federal Environment Agency (UBA), is confident the country will meet its 2030 targets, even though \"we are not doing brilliantly in all sectors.\" Messner added in a statement that more needs to be done \u2014 particularly in the transport sector \u2014 to phase out climate-damaging subsidies.\nOne target the country will likely miss, according to analysts, is its 2030 goal of having 15 million electric cars on the road. Currently, the number is 2.3 million, including hybrid models. At the end of 2023, the coalition was forced to cancel subsidies for purchasing e-cars because of the budget deficit.\nExpansion of electric car charging infrastructure is also lagging, with Oliver Blume, CEO of beleaguered German carmaker Volkswagen Group, calling for renewed support in building out the network. German carmakers, which are playing catch-up in the e-car segment, are seeing falling vehicle sales, with Volkswagen planning thousands of layoffs.\nRenewable energy expansion is doing much better than e-mobility, according to Claudia Kemfert. \"Important framework conditions have been significantly improved in the solar energy and wind energy sectors,\" she said, although she also advocates for stronger climate action.\nThe share of green energy in the country's electricity mix is now over 60%, up from 43% in 2021. If Germany reaches its 80% by 2030 goal \"would be an important milestone in achieving the climate targets,\" added Kemfert.\nAt the same time, Russia's war in Ukraine has made it more difficult to implement climate policies set out in the coalition agreement, said Kemfert.\nAfter Russia's invasion in 2022, the country cut billions of cubic meters of pipeline gas supplies to Europe. Germany was particularly dependent on Russian gas. Energy prices skyrocketed, forcing the country to act quickly.\n\"It must be acknowledged that this [energy] crisis was handled well,\" said BUND climate analyst L\u00f6ffelsend.\nGermany built new liquefied natural gas (LNG terminals) in the North Sea and diversified its supply with gas from other countries. But this also created an overcapacity, \"which will cost us all dearly,\" said L\u00f6ffelsend.\u00a0Like coal and oil,\u00a0\u00a0LNG is a fossil fuel\u00a0and burning it drives planetary heating.\nTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video\nUBA's Messner told DW that concerns the outbreak of the war would see a \"coal and fossil fuel renaissance\" in Germany turned out to be unfounded. \"This is mainly due to the very successful expansion of renewable energies.\"\nLast year, German emissions fell around 10%, the sharpest decline since 1990. Still, that's not all down to climate policy. A sluggish economy and declines in production also played a role, said UBA.\nWith a political crisis at home to manage, Chancellor Olaf Scholz cancelled his attendance at the UN climate conference in Baku, Azerbaijan\u00a0last week. Negotiators at the summit are trying to hash out a new financing target for developing countries to cope with climate disasters and transform their energy systems. Rich and poor states are at odds over who should pay and how much.\nGermany is negotiating as part of the EU delegation and is still a strong partner despite domestic troubles, Jennifer Morgan, the country's special envoy for climate policy, told DW.\n\"We have a full mandate from the existing minority government,\" said Morgan last week in Baku, adding that Germany stands by its climate commitments.\nStill, Oxfam climate analyst Jan Kowalzig fears the prospect of an entirely new government in February and Germany's mixed climate record at home\u00a0could hold back partner countries from bolstering their own efforts. Germany has traditionally played a leading role in climate policy.\nTo keep global warming under 1.5 degrees Celsius , the limit agreed in Paris, states must collectively cut emissions 42% by the end of the decade. And the world is currently a long way off that target.\nThis article was originally written in German.",

To counter this, senior politicians Gregor Gysi, Dietmar Bartsch, and Bodo Ramelow are campaigning under \"Mission Silver Locks,\" aiming to win constituency seats that could bypass the threshold. Despite their experience, the party risks losing voters to the splinter Sahra Wagenknecht Alliance. Critics argue the Left Party should focus on younger candidates to revitalize its base and appeal to a broader demographic.",
            "content": "The Left Party has dramatically lost voter support. But for the general election in February, a trio of seniors is coming to the rescue \u2014 banking on a quirk in German electoral law.\nGermany's Left Party is struggling for survival. For many weeks, opinion polls have put them well below the 5% threshold for representation in parliament.\nNow, three of the party's most senior and most popular politicians have decided to make sure their party is represented no matter how poor the overall performance.\nOn February 23, 2025, Germany is set to hold a snap election. Germans have two votes: one for\u00a0a candidate in their constituency, the other\u00a0for a party. This second vote determines the number of seats a party gets in the Bundestag. Any party that scores less than 5% fails to get representation.\nHowever, an exception exists: If\u00a0three party candidates win in their respective constituencies, the 5% threshold is waived.\nThis exception in electoral law came to the Left Party's aid in the 2021 federal election when it garnered only 4.9% of the vote.\nHowever, because three Left Party candidates won their constituencies, the Left was allowed to fill 4.9% of the seats in parliament and send a total of 39 MPs.\nThe Left Party hopes to pull off this rare feat once again in 2025.\nTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video\nHowever, this is likely to be even more difficult this time around, as the party will likely lose many voters to the\u00a0left-wing populist\u00a0Sahra Wagenknecht Alliance (BSW), which split off from the Left Party in early 2024 and has since performed significantly better in regional elections and opinion polls.\nGregor Gysi, Bodo Ramelow\u00a0and Dietmar Bartsch, all well past retirement age, may now be the best hope for a party that dates back to the communist German Democratic Republic,\u00a0and is now more worried about its future than ever before.\nThey call their renewed candidacy for the Bundestag \"Mission Silver Locks\" \u2014 an ironic reference to their average age of\u00a070.\nThe most prominent among them is Gregor Gysi, who is turning\u00a077 years old in January. He played a pivotal role in the successful transformation of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany (SED) in East Germany, helping it to become\u00a0the Left Party as it is today.\nGysi, a former lawyer and eloquent orator, has been a member of the German Bundestag almost continuously since 1990, winning his Berlin constituency eight times by a wide margin.\nGysi believes he and his party continue to be a much-needed voice in reunified Germany.\u00a0\"If arguments from the left are no longer heard\u00a0in the Bundestag, debates\u00a0will become a lot more limited,\" he said, adding that the Left Party was still the voice of eastern German voters\u00a0more than any other party.\nThis view is also shared by Dietmar Bartsch, Gysi's decadeslong comrade and confidant. The 66-year-old comes from the northeastern region of\u00a0Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania, where the Left Party has been part of the state government since 2021 in coalition with the center-left Social Democratic Party (SPD).\nBartsch has said there is only one left-wing party in the Bundestag:\u00a0the Left Party. \"All the others tend to jockey for the center,\" he\u00a0said.\nBartsch, who holds a doctorate in economics, has been a member of the Bundestag since 1998 with only a brief interruption. He has also served as the parliamentary group\u00a0leader and, as managing director of the Left Party, has organized numerous electoral campaigns.\nUnlike Gysi, however, Bartsch has never won his constituency and got into parliament only via\u00a0his party's state list. A victory in his constituency would, therefore, be a first.\nThe third of the three most promising Left Party candidates\u00a0is Bodo Ramelow, the head of government in\u00a0the eastern state of Thuringia.\nRamelow,\u00a068, recently lost in his state's election but remains very popular. If he wins his constituency for the Left Party in the Bundestag election, it would come as no surprise.\nRamelow was a member of the Bundestag from 2005 to 2009. Now, together with Gysi and Bartsch, he wants to help his badly shaken party back into the Bundestag.\nThe Left Party's membership has an average age of 55, and only one-third of them are women. Critics have suggested that rather than banking on elderly candidates to lead the party into the future, it should embrace diversity and focus on\u00a0the younger generation in the big cities.\nThis article was originally written in German.\nWhile you're here: Every Tuesday, DW editors round up what is happening in German politics and society.

In France, the National Assembly voted against a budget that included significant tax reforms, including wealth taxes and higher levies on large corporations. Meanwhile, Germany's Chancellor Olaf Scholz faces a funding crisis, needing billions to support welfare and renewable energy programs. Both countries may resort to provisional budget management, limiting spending to essential functions. Scholz and French Prime Minister Michel Barnier are navigating political challenges as they approach key parliamentary decisions.",
            "content": "French lawmakers have rejected a draft budget for 2025, while Germany is also going into the new year without a final spending plan.\nGerman Chancellor Olaf Scholz and French Prime Minister Michel Barnier have similar problems at the moment: They would like to push through policies, but do not have enough funds from parliament to do so.\nOn Tuesday, France's lower house, the National Assembly, overwhelmingly rejected the first part of the budget for 2025, which involved revenues, by a large majority. While 392 lawmakers voted against it, 192 lawmakers from the government camp and from the far-right National Rally voted in favor. The vote came after a two-week debate in which the left-wing New Popular Front alliance, which makes up the largest political bloc in parliament, had reshaped the bill with amendments.\nThese included wealth tax on billionaires, a tax hike on \"super-dividends\" from large corporations, a tax on multinationals and higher taxes for digital companies, as well as a new tax for particularly loud motorcycles. Lawmakers had also scrapped the government's plans to impose higher taxes on electricity and gas heating,\u00a0and not replaced it.\nThe national budget is a government program expressed in figures. In these times of upheaval, these figures are\u00a0lacking in both Berlin and Paris.\nWhile Barnier can still hope for a regular budget in 2025 despite this defeat, the current minority government in Berlin cannot. At best, a supplementary budget for 2024 could, with opposition support, be passed before the dissolution of the Bundestag ahead of a snap election in February.\nThis is necessary because the German government is still short of money. It needs \u20ac3.7 billion (ca. $3.9 billion) to cover additional expenditure for the Citizen's Allowance, a state welfare benefit for basic income support, and more than \u20ac10 billion to promote renewable energies. If it doesn't find this money before the end of the year, it will have to respond with a budget freeze.\nWhen US President-elect Donald Trump returns to the White House on January 20,\u00a0the Bundestag will probably have been dissolved. Almost five weeks later, on February 23, Germans will then elect a new parliament. Depending on the results, the formation of a government could drag on well into spring.\nGermany will still have a chancellor and ministers after the dissolution of parliament by the president, but only in an executive capacity. During the transition phase, they will no longer be allowed to make fundamental or far-reaching decisions.\nOnly a new government will be able to negotiate with the new Trump administration or push ahead with decisions at the European Union level. Until then, Germany will have to wait and see.\nBut perhaps some will also be breathing a sigh of relief, as the coalition that has now failed has been considered a difficult partner in Brussels in recent years. In recent years, the coalition government repeatedly avoided making delicate decisions by abstaining, for example on the EU Supply Chain Act and on emissions regulations for trucks.\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron nominated 73-year-old Barnier from the conservative Republican party as prime minister after he dissolved parliament and prompted a fresh parliamentary election\u00a0earlier this year. Even together, Macron's centrist alliance and the Republicans do not have a majority in the National Assembly. They also don't have a binding government program, despite Barnier being in office for two months now.\nThe fact that the 2025 budget failed in the National Assembly could help the prime minister, because it is not the amended draft that will go to the upper house, the Senate, but the government's original draft.\nThe cuts to social benefits and public spending totaling around \u20ac60 billion for the 2025 budget are likely to have an easier time in the conservative Senate than in the National Assembly, where the necessity for austerity is more controversial. In June, the European Commission launched an excessive deficit procedure\u00a0against France and reprimanded it for breaking budget rules.\nCredit rating agencies are also keeping an eye on Paris. With a deficit of 6% of GDP this year and a mountain of debt amounting to 113% of GDP, France's budget situation is dramatic.\nShortly after Chancellor Scholz faces a vote of confidence in the Bundestag on December 16, the fate of his French counterpart could also be decided. According to the current timetable, the French budget for 2025 is due to be finalized by the joint mediation committee of both houses of parliament in the last week before Christmas. The National Assembly will then have to make the final decision.\nIt's quite possible that the French government, faced with the threat of defeat, will resort to Article 49.3 of the Constitution to pass the budget without a final vote. If the government relies on this special article, the opposition will have 24 hours to table a motion of censure. If this receives a majority, the government will have to resign and the draft budget will fail.\nIf this happens, the EU's two largest economies would be paralyzed and forced to resort to provisional budget management at the turn of a decisive year. In both countries, such budget management is limited to obligations that already exist or are legally prescribed and only intended to guarantee the basic functions of the state.\u00a0Salaries, pensions and social benefits are covered but political projects remain on hold.\nScholz and Barnier will meet in the Berlin this coming week, when the latter makes\u00a0his first official visit to the German capital as prime minister.\nThis article was originally written in German.\nTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video",

            "content": "On the surface, the German electoral system is similar to that of most other Western countries, although it does have its own quirks and peculiarities. DW explains.\nWhen Germans go to their polling stations \u2014 in schools and other public buildings \u2014 they have two votes: One for a candidate to represent their constituency and the second for a party's state list, which usually lists between 10 and 30 candidates. The system is often referred to as \"personalized proportional representation.\"\nThe first vote, for a direct candidate\u00a0running in the respective electoral district, determines half of the parliament's total composition, ensuring that each district is represented.\nThe second vote determines the strength of the parties in the lower House of Parliament, the Bundestag and thereby determines how many candidates from that state list will be granted seats in the Bundestag.\nFrom 2025, the number of seats in parliament will be limited to 630 seats. A reform to the election system was introduced in 2024, doing away with provisions that made the number of lawmakers balloon as the size of parties shrank. This reform was partially overturned by the top court.\nTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video\nAround 61\u00a0million of Germany's 83 million population are eligible to vote. These are German nationals aged 18 and over. If they have lived in the country for at least three consecutive\u00a0months in the last 25 years, German nationals who live abroad can vote by\u00a0post. The website of Germany's Federal Returning Officer does not ban embassies or consulates from maintaining ballot boxes but says it would involve a \"disproportionate amount of effort.\"\nThe right to vote may be revoked by a court for individuals who committed certain political crimes \u2014 like espionage and disclosure of state secrets \u2014 but under no circumstances in the case of crimes such as murder, manslaughter and serious sexual abuse of children.\nThe same rules apply to the candidates\u00a0who their respective parties put forward.\nJust over half of the electorate are women, almost 40% are age 60 and above\u00a0and 14% are younger than 30.\nVoter turnout tends to be high in Germany. In\u00a0the last two general elections, it has been just over 76%.\nUnder German election law, parties must obtain a minimum of 5%\u00a0of the party votes (second votes) to secure representation. The provision was first introduced in 1953 and was intended to prevent tiny splinter parties like those that plagued the Weimar Republic from entering into parliament and fragmenting it, making it hard to form a viable majority.\nHowever, an exception is granted to parties that field winning candidates in at least three electoral districts: winning three individual mandates lifts the 5%\u00a0threshold for the respective party. In 2021, for example, this applied to the Left Party, which won only 4.9% of the second votes but was allowed to fill 4.9% of the seats and send 39 lawmakers because three of their candidates won in their constituencies.\nThe second exception is for candidates representing\u00a0a recognized German minority, like the Danish in Schleswig-Holstein or the Sorbs in Saxony. It takes between 35,000 and 38,000 votes to win a constituency, so that is the number of votes a representative of a minority party needs to garner to get a seat in the Bundestag. In 2021, Stefan Seidler, the representative of the Danish minority, won 55,000 votes securing a seat in parliament.\nIf a party gains 50% of the vote it would then effectively have representatives to push through its own agenda. But that is unlikely to happen. For that reason, parties in Germany usually need to partner with one or more parties to build a coalition with enough votes to control the Bundestag.\nTraditionally, the candidate of the party gaining the most votes will become chancellor and the leading candidate of the junior coalition partner is often tapped to become foreign minister. The chancellor presents the names of the ministers and their portfolios to the president, who appoints the members of government.\nAny German citizen who is at least 18 years old can become chancellor. A seat in the Bundestag is not necessary, but he or she\u00a0needs to garner a majority of lawmakers' votes.\nThe Basic Law, the German constitution,\u00a0stipulates that the first session of the new Bundestag must take place within 30 days after the election.\nThe president officially proposes the candidate for chancellor who then\u00a0needs to win an absolute majority of the votes (50+1). If the candidate fails to achieve this, the members of the Bundestag can pick another candidate and put him or her to a vote within a fortnight. Again, an absolute majority is required.\nIf no candidate wins an absolute majority in the second round of voting, a final ballot is held immediately. Whoever receives the most votes in that round\u00a0is elected by simple majority.\nIf the chancellor is elected with an absolute majority, the president must appoint him or her within seven days. If the elected person only achieved a simple majority in the third round, the president must either appoint him or her within seven days or dissolve the Bundestag, triggering new elections within 60 days.\nAccording to Germany's election review law, every individual eligible to vote in Germany can contest the validity of the election, as can groups of people eligible to vote. After each general election, there are hundreds of challenges to the results.\nObjections must be made in writing\u00a0to the election review commission with the Bundestag in Berlin within two months of election day.\nThe election review commission processes all submissions. A decision is made on each individual challenge, and each objector receives written feedback from the Bundestag.\nTo invalidate the results of a Bundestag election, an objection must meet two requirements. First, there must be an electoral error that violates the Federal Election Act, the Federal Election Code\u00a0or the constitution. Secondly, the reported electoral error would have to have an impact on the distribution of seats in the Bundestag.\nThe commission needs about a year to process all appeals. Less than 4% of those cases reached the Constitutional Court. A German national vote has never been declared invalid.\nUnder normal circumstances, elections happen again four years later, and then it's back to square one.\nThis article has been updated to reflect the regulations as they apply to the general election in February 2025.",

            "content": "In a live talk with X owner Elon Musk, Alternative for Germany chancellor candidate Alice Weidel claimed that Nazi leader Adolf Hitler was not \"right-wing,\" but a communist instead. Historians vehemently disagree.\nDuring Thursday's live discussion between Elon Musk\u00a0and Alice Weidel,\u00a0the chancellor candidate for the nationalist Alternative for Germany (AfD) party in February's election, on the\u00a0X (formerly Twitter)platform, both participants made many hard-to-verify claims, several of which\u00a0DW's fact checkers have already\u00a0looked into.\nBut one claim in particular, about the National Socialist German Workers Party (NSDAP), or Nazis,\u00a0and World War II, was particularly off: Weidel said Adolf Hitler was not \"right-wing,\"\u00a0but a \"communist.\" This historical revisionism, an attempt to retell the history of\u00a0National Socialism, is not new. As nationalists rise in international politics, it is frequently being repeated.\nClaim: \"[The National Socialists] nationalized the entire industry. ... The biggest success after that terrible era in our history was to label Adolf Hitler as right and conservative. He was exactly the opposite. He wasn't a conservative. ...\u00a0He was a communist, socialist guy,\"\u00a0Weidel told Musk. In a follow-up interview with the German broadcaster ntv, she repeatedly emphasized: \"I don't deviate from this either:\u00a0Adolf Hitler\u00a0was a leftist.\"\nDW Fact check: False\nThis claim is false and trivializes the atrocities committed under Hitler and the Nazis from 1933 through 1945. The AfD, which in Germany is often classified as far right to extreme right, has repeatedly tried to distance itself from Nazism. Right-wing politicians in the United States, including Vice President-elect JD Vance, have also spread false statements about Germany's Nazi history (read DW's fact check on these claims here).\u00a0Many people online seem to believe\u00a0the AfD leader's assertion nonetheless.\n\"What Ms. Weidel is saying is sheer nonsense, which I don't want to promote by taking it seriously,\"\u00a0German historian Thomas Sandk\u00fchler told DW via email.\nMichael Wildt, a prominent historian of the Third Reich, also told DW that Weidel's claim was \"huge nonsense.\"\n\"Hitler fought Marxism fiercely and brutally right from the start,\" Wildt said, \"and the first victims to be imprisoned, tortured and killed in the concentration camps in 1933 were leftists, communists, Social Democrats and socialists.\"\nHitler's policies directly contradicted the goals of communism. \"From an economic point of view in particular, Hitler was not a communist,\"\u00a0Thomas Weber, historian and author of the book Becoming Hitler: The Making of a Nazi,\u00a0told DW. \"Economically,\u00a0communism aims to overcome private property, to overcome a profit-oriented economy and to transfer the most important means of production (like\u00a0mines and factories) and natural resources into common property,\"\u00a0Weber said. Hitler rejected these aims.\nHitler also can't be described as a communist \"because he was an antisemite and a racist,\" Wildt said. \"And that has nothing to do with the idea of a communist society in which people are equal \u2014 rather, it is exactly the opposite.\"\nThe political movement of National Socialism was not in fact socialism. And it did not just emerge during Hitler's time, but had already emerged after World War I, becoming increasingly entrenched toward\u00a0World War II. \"National Socialism was extremely nationalist, anti-democratic, anti-pluralist, antisemitic, racist, imperialist and anti-communist,\"\u00a0according to the Brandenburg Center for Political Education website, which adds that the racist exclusion of minorities up to and including genocide played a central role in the ideology.\nNational Socialism benefited from some of the ideas of socialism, using them to win working-class votes en route to taking power in 1933. However, the Nazi labor and social legislation that followed led to the suppression, persecution and murder of communists, Social Democrats and trade unionists.\n\"The essential point here is that, from Hitler's and many National Socialists' point of view, the \u2018socialism' in the party name was not an empty formula or a trick,\" Weber said. \"Rather, it defined how Hitler saw himself and how he wanted to rebuild the world. He repeatedly emphasized this in private and in public.\"\nIn the early days of the NSDAP, there was a self-proclaimed socialist wing, but this was eliminated before the party came to power in 1933. Hitler had Gregor Strasser, a leading figure in this wing, killed in June 1934, along with other opponents within the party. Though the so-called Strasser wing sought a national socialism in favor of the German working class, it was just as racist and antisemitic as the rest of the NSDAP.\nFor these reasons, most historians have long agreed that National Socialism cannot be equated with socialism. But there are politicians who still attempt to do so for political reasons, Weber said.\n\"This question is usually discussed too narrowly \u2014 along the lines of: was Hitler left-wing or right-wing?\" Weber said.\u00a0\"And then either the right-wing side tries to portray Hitler as a classic socialist and leftist, which makes no sense, or there is an attempt to reduce the use of the term 'socialism' by Hitler and the National Socialists to an election campaign ploy. That doesn't make sense either, because it ignores how Hitler and the National Socialists defined themselves, how they saw the world, and how they tried to change the world.\"\nThis article was originally written in German.\nTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video",

In order to meet that goal, the coalition \u2014 which included Scholz\u2019s Social Democratic Party and the Greens \u2014 massively expanded renewable energies and subsidized energy-intensive companies to help them achieve climate neutrality.\nGermany, as a result, is the European Union's industrial leader in producing green infrastructure, having the most facilities for producing solar and wind technology. It has the second-most facilities for making of heat pumps, trailing Italy.\nMerz, however, suggested he would radically change course.\n\u201cIn recent years, we have agreed often enough on which [energy resource] we will phase out,\u201d he said during his speech, mentioning both coal and nuclear energy. \u201cBut as long as we don't have a replacement, decommissioning what we have is out of the question. If we continue to do this, we will massively jeopardize Germany as an industrial location, and we are not prepared to do that.\u201d\nFor more polling data from across Europe visit  POLITICO Poll of Polls.\nMerz and his conservative alliance are polling at 31 percent support, putting them in pole position to lead Germany\u2019s next coalition government after the country\u2019s Feb. 23 election. The far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) party is polling second with 21 percent support.\nThe problem for Merz is that, given the AfD\u2019s strength, his conservatives are almost certain to have to govern with the SPD or the Greens, the parties that pushed the policies he\u2019s railing against. Merz has ruled out a coalition with the AfD.\nDuring his Bochum visit, Merz also expressed skepticism of the previous government\u2019s focus on \u201cgreen steel,\u201d steelworks powered by hydrogen derived from renewable power, saying in a panel discussion that he does not \"believe that the rapid switch to hydrogen-powered steelworks will be successful.\"\nThyssenKrupp, the erstwhile national steel champion, received about \u20ac2 billion in government subsidies in 2023 to speed its transformation away from CO2-emitting production by replacing coal-fired steel furnaces with new ones powered by hydrogen.\nIn Bochum, Merz suggested he'd bet on carbon capture to mitigate emissions generated from steelworks instead of seeking to avoid them completely with hydrogen.\nMerz\u2019s central concern about hydrogen made from renewables is cost. But\u00a0experts warn that\u00a0carbon capture, an electricity-hungry technology, also comes with a hefty price tag and is not yet available at the scale needed to decarbonize the steel sector.\nRobert Habeck, the chancellor candidate for the Greens, pushed back against Merz\u2019s comments on hydrogen-powered steelworks.\n\u201cNobody should believe that steel produced with coal-fired power and coal energy still has a chance on the world market,\u201d Habeck told reporters on Tuesday.\nSPD leaders also criticized Merz.\n\u201cAnyone who wants to dial back now will destroy billion-euro investments and tens of thousands of jobs,\u201d Anke Rehlinger, the premier of the southwestern state of Saarland, where the steel industry is a key sector, told German outlet Stern.\nZia Weise, Rasmus Buchsteiner and Chris Lunday contributed reporting.\nChancellor Olaf Scholz\u2019s latest demand is likely to stall a \u20ac3 billion aid package to the war-ravaged country as Russian forces continue their advance.\n\u201cThe objective exchange of arguments is becoming increasingly difficult\u201d on the platform formerly known as Twitter, says defense ministry.\nThe EU\u2019s strategy to deal with the far-right Freedom Party heading for power in Vienna is \u2026 hope for the best.\nGod!

            "summary": "The upcoming federal election in Germany on February 23 raises concerns about the role of social media in political campaigns, especially with the rise of populist parties like the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD). Experts highlight the effectiveness of platforms like TikTok in engaging first-time voters and note a trend of polarization, as extremist parties thrive on social media. The influence of foreign disinformation, particularly from Russia, poses additional challenges. While traditional parties struggle with disinformation and personal attacks, there is a call for them to engage more actively on social media to counteract these trends.",
            "content": "After Donald Trump's US election win and with an early federal election slated to take place in Germany on February 23, questions are being asked about what role social media could \u2014 and should \u2014 play in party campaigns.\nThe leaders of Germany's traditional parties are clearly nervous about the rise of populist parties.\nThe far-right\u00a0Alternative for Germany (AfD) secured just over 30% of the vote in recent state\u00a0elections in Thuringia and Saxony, which was partly\u00a0attributed to the party's effectiveness at reaching first-time voters on TikTok.\nMatthias Kettemann, an expert on internet regulation and media law at the University of Innsbruck in Austria, argues that it its impossible to say exactly what impact social media has in shaping public opinion and democratic decision-making processes more broadly.\nHowever, what is clear is that more and more people are using social media and that there is a general trend toward\u00a0polarization. \"The parties on the far right and far left tend to do much better on social media because they tend to have easier stories to tell, which in turn foster engagement together with the amplification algorithms of the platforms,\" Kettemann told DW.\nObservers are also wary of the growing influence of Elon Musk, the world's wealthiest man and CEO of the platform X, who was arguably Trump's greatest ally in his successful campaign to retake the US presidency.\nAfter Germany's ruling coalition government collapsed on November 6, Musk repeatedly referred to Germany's center-left leaders as \"fools.\"\nMeanwhile, Vice Chancellor and Economy Minister Robert Habeck, of Germany's\u00a0Green Party, this week\u00a0made a surprise comeback to the microblogging platform following a six-year break, saying he did not think it was right to leave X to the \"loudmouths and populists.\"\n\"The most important problem is disinformation from the top,\" said J\u00f6rg Hassler, an expert in digital and political communication at Ludwig Maximilian University in Munich.

His proposals include delaying climate disclosure rules and waiving fines for automakers not meeting emission targets. Critics from his conservative opponents accuse him of adopting their policies in a desperate bid to improve his political standing. Scholz's requests echo previous demands and highlight ongoing tensions regarding EU policies and Germany's economic challenges, especially concerning the automotive sector.",
            "content": "German Chancellor appeals to the EU executive to slash regulation and support industry with subsidies \u2014 only to be accused by his conservative opponents of stealing their policies.\nBRUSSELS \u2014 An increasingly desperate Olaf Scholz has issued an appeal to Brussels to support European industry, only to draw a rebuke from his conservative opponents that he is stealing from their policy agenda in a bid to stave off a general election defeat next month.\nIn a letter to European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen obtained by POLITICO, the German chancellor calls on the executive to offer more cash for businesses and to slash red tape that he says is holding back the bloc\u2019s industries.\nEchoing long-standing demands from Europe\u2019s center right, Scholz, a Social Democrat, wants a delay on climate disclosure rules affecting businesses; the waiving of fines for car manufacturers that fail to meet new emission targets; and subsidized electricity prices.\nScholz\u2019s asks are not new and repeat demands made by his center-left government last year. But by putting them into a formal letter to von der Leyen, a fellow German, Scholz is making a last-ditch effort to recast his reputation as a pro-business leader with a plan to save Germany\u2019s ailing economy and critical auto industry.\nHis critics aren\u2019t buying it.\nScholz \u201cseems to be slipping into schizophrenia toward the end of his term of office,\u201d said Hildegard Bentele, a European lawmaker from Germany\u2019s Christian Democratic Union, which is part of the center-right European People\u2019s Party group.\nHis suggestions are \u201calmost 100 percent EPP policy,\u201d Bentele argues, adding that she \u201cwonders where he was last year\u201d when von der Leyen was presenting her plans for her second term as Commission chief.\nWith less than two months to go before a snap election on Feb. 23 that he\u2019s expected to lose, Scholz is running out of time. Polls put his Social Democratic Party in third place with 17 percent, well below the CDU (30 percent) and just behind the far-right Alternative for Germany party.\nGerman businesses have criticized Scholz\u2019s government for unambitious reforms, uncompetitive energy costs and excessive bureaucracy at a time of stagnation in Europe\u2019s largest economy. The Bundesbank has slashed its growth forecast for 2025 to just 0.2 percent, with United States President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s threats to slap tariffs on all imports.\nGermany\u2019s export-based economy would suffer if it\u2019s caught between Trump\u2019s tariffs and Chinese industrial subsidies: The country\u2019s companies have high exports to both the U.S. and China.\nScholz claims the European Union\u2019s policies should enable those exports and not anger trading partners. One such example is a planned EU carbon border tax, the Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism.\nAccording to Scholz, the carbon tax needs to be reworked to boost the attractiveness of energy-intensive products, like steel, made in Europe. As it stands, the CBAM would only impose tariffs on incoming products, shielding European companies from cheaper products that don\u2019t meet the same standards.\nGerman automakers, meanwhile, are highly exposed to the Chinese market \u2014 making Berlin a staunch opponent of the Commission\u2019s duties on made-in-China electric vehicles following an anti-subsidy investigation pushed for by Paris. Scholz again decried the duties in his letter, calling for a negotiated solution.\nWhile France and Germany are at loggerheads over the made-in-China EV duties, Scholz highlighted the two\u2019s unlikely partnership to lobby for an end to the fines that automakers face this year should they fail to hit new emission targets.\nA coalition of EU countries is advocating for the waiver, including a proposal from Italy and the Czech Republic that calls for an earlier review of the overarching 2035 legislation requiring zero-emission vehicle sales.\nFrance and Germany opted out of cosigning the mandate over disagreements about the use of biofuels, but\u00a0conspired with Italy\u00a0ahead of the EU\u2019s Competitiveness Council meeting in November.\n\u201cWe didn\u2019t agree on everything, but we agreed that we have a problem,\u201d said a French government official with knowledge of the discussions who was granted anonymity because they were not permitted to comment on the matter. \u201cWe basically converged on the fact that we would act together on the Competitiveness Council to put forward the issue of the fines.\u201d\nSuch a move would be welcome news to major automakers like Volkswagen and Renault that have bemoaned the fines.\nBut it\u2019s unlikely to win Scholz their votes.\n\u201cGermany is at the top when it comes to tax and bureaucracy burdens. It is not enough to just talk about reducing bureaucracy,\u201d German car lobby VDA commented on the letter. \u201cAnd not only in Germany, but also in Brussels \u2014 this is where most of the new bureaucratic costs are now being incurred.\u201d\nAnother big request from Scholz is for a two-year delay on the EU\u2019s incoming corporate sustainability disclosure rules, which the shaky French government also supports. Or at least, the old one did.\nAdopted in 2023, the rules require businesses to report on climate risks their operations are exposed to, as well their own impact on the environment. So far, only the largest companies are expected to report this information.\nMinisters from Scholz\u2019s coalition had already requested a delay in their own letter to the Commission back in December. That was after former Finance Minister Christian Lindner had said Berlin should seek to abolish the law altogether, and former French Prime Minister Michele Barnier suggested a moratorium on the text.\nBut again here, the EPP had gotten there first. Now officially expected in the new mandate, a major simplification of the disclosure rules was a campaign promise made by von der Leyen to the EPP.\nScholz\u2019s political opponents were quick to point out the similarities, with Julia Kl\u00f6ckner, the CDU\u2019s economic policy spokesperson, calling the Scholz letter \u201ca helpless election campaign maneuver\u201d that \u201clacks credibility.\u201d\nIndustry insiders say the EU has to go on the offensive to save its carmakers in the transition to electric vehicles.\nGabrielius Landsbergis told POLITICO there is little chance of China becoming a \u201cguarantor of peace.\u201d\nRide-hailing app Uber is among those calling to \u201caccelerate electrification efforts.\u201d\nThe company ran into big problems with production at a time when demand for EVs slumped.",

            "content": "Christian Democrat chancellor candidate Friedrich Merz has taken a surprise trip to Kyiv. He told President Volodymyr Zelenskyy that everything must be done to allow Ukraine to fully exercise its right to self-defense.\nFriedrich Merz, the leader of Germany's center-right Christian Democrats (CDU), arrived in the Ukrainiancapital of Kyiv early on Monday.\nThe conservative candidate for chancellor in the country's upcoming snap elections was visiting the country for the second time since the Russian invasion began in 2022.\nMerz said he wanted to use the visit to inform himself \"of the present condition of the defense of this country\" and assure it of Germany's continued backing.\nArriving by train from Poland, he said he wanted to\u00a0\"help this battered country to continue to defend itself against Russian aggression.\"\nThe conservative leader said in a post on X, \"the war in Ukraine must end as soon as possible. Only if Ukraine can defend itself will Putin enter into negotiations.\"\nLater on Monday, Merz met with\u00a0President Volodymyr Zelenskyy.\n\"We want your army to be capable of hitting military bases in Russia. Not the civilian population, not infrastructure, but the military targets from which your country is being attacked,\" Merz told the president. He added that restrictions many Western allies had placed on Ukraine's ability to use their weapons was \"akin to\u00a0forcing your country to fight with one hand tied behind your back.\"\n\"We must do everything we can to enable Ukraine to exercise its right\u00a0to self-defence without restriction. And do everything we can to end\u00a0this war as quickly as possible,\" Merz said at a meeting with\u00a0Zelenskyy.\nMerz again indicated that he would be far more open to supplying Ukraine with Germany's long-range Taurus cruise missiles. He said that Zelenskyy \"knows our position on the Taurus. Nothing has changed in this regard.\"\nAt the same joint press conference, Zelenskyy floated the idea of foreign troops fighting on behalf of Ukraine until his country gained NATO membership.\n\"A troop contingent from one country or another could be present in Ukraine for as long as it isn't part of NATO. But for that we need to have a clear understanding of when Ukraine becomes an EU member and when a NATO member,\" Zelenskyy said.\nThe Ukrainian leader also stressed to Merz the importance of European\u00a0security guarantees in any potential negotiations with Russia to end\u00a0Russia the war.\u00a0Ukraine needs security guarantees not only from NATO, but also\u00a0directly from European countries, Zelensky said\nMerz's visit to show support comes at a time when the future of the war is increasingly uncertain. It is not yet known if US President-elect Donald Trump will continue to provide Ukraine with aid, and Ukrainian forces have been losing territory along the Russian border.\nRussia has also stepped up drone strikes on energy infrastructure as winter temperatures start to drop across Ukraine.\nMerz said\u00a0Ukraine's allies in Europe must be prepared for any\u00a0eventualities, and key powers like Germany, France and the\u00a0United\u00a0Kingdom \"can only develop this strategy together.\"\u00a0Zelensky also suggested that Denmark could play an important role.\nMeanwhile, the presidential spokesman said that Ukraine plans to call a meeting of its key European allies in December to coordinate a joint position and make sure that Kyiv is in a strong position on the battlefield and in any potential talks.\nGermany is the second-largest supplier of military equipment to Ukraine after the United States. So far, Chancellor Olaf Scholz\u00a0has refused to send Kyiv\u00a0the longer-range Taurus missiles it has repeatedly asked for. Merz has said that if he is elected in February, he will reverse that decision.\nes,dh/rm,rc (AFP, dpa)\nWhile you're here: Every Tuesday, DW editors round up what is happening in German politics and society.

Ukraine seeks the missiles to strike Russian positions amid escalating attacks.

            "content": "Germany will not follow the United States in delivering long-range cruise missiles to Ukraine, Chancellor Olaf Scholz says. Officials fear that they could be used against targets within Russia.\nThe Taurus cruise missile is one of the most powerful weapons in the German army's arsenal, and has been at the top of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy's wish list for a long time. However, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz, of the Social Democrats (SPD), continues to reject exports of the weapon to Ukraine.\nWith a\u00a0warhead that can penetrate bunkers, the Taurus cruise missile\u00a0has a range of 500 kilometers (300 miles) and can be fired by a fighter jet. Ukraine wants to use it to attack positions inside Russia from which President Vladimir Putin's military is bombing Ukraine. Russian rocket fire on cities in Ukraine has recently increased again.\nThe debate was reignited in Germany again after US President Joe Biden \u2014 just two months before the end of his term in office \u2014 reportedly decided\u00a0to allow Ukraine to use long-range missiles produced in the United States against targets in Russia. Biden is said to have changed his mind partly because Russia has persuaded North Korea to send thousands of soldiers to fight in the war.\nTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video\nIn view of Ukraine's precarious military situation, more and more people are now calling for Germany to deliver Taurus missiles to Ukraine. However, these can fly significantly further than the American ATACMS missiles, which Ukraine may now use for the first time in the next few days to attack targets in Russia.\nThere has been a renewed push for such deliveries from the Free Democratic Party (FDP), which two weeks ago triggered new elections by leaving Scholz's coalition. The party wants to take this to the Bundestag: It is considering putting a motion to parliament for a vote before the early federal election on February 23.\nOne of the most vehement German supporters of the Taurus delivery is Marie-Agnes Strack-Zimmermann, a member of the European Parliament for the FDP. Referring to Biden's decision, she wrote on the social media platform X: \"I hope that Chancellor Olaf Scholz will have the same belated realization at the end of his term of office in the interest of Europe's security. If he is true to his word that he will act together with his allies, then he must finally act now.\"\nThe conservative\u00a0Christian Democratic Union (CDU), the largest opposition party in the Bundestag, also supports the delivery of Taurus cruise missiles to Ukraine. There is also approval from the Greens, the only remaining coalition partner of the SPD: Robert Habeck, economy minister and his party's chancellor candidate, said he would deliver Taurus cruise missiles to Ukraine if he were leading the government.\nForeign Minister Annalena Baerbock, a fellow Green, also reacted positively to reports that Biden is allowing Ukraine to use long-range missiles against specific targets in Russia, which she said would allow Ukraine to potentially destroy military launch bases from which it is being attacked. Some places in Ukraine are so close to the Russian border that air defense is of no help, the foreign minister said.\nTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video\nSo far, the government has only allowed Ukraine to use German weapons in the Russian territories bordering the city of Kharkiv, which has repeatedly come under heavy fire from the Russian side.\nThough there are many voices in favor of delivering the Taurus, Scholz remains categorically opposed to delivering the weapon system. He argues that Germany runs the risk of being drawn into the war between Russia and Ukraine if the Taurus cruise missiles are used. \"We must not be linked in any way or at any place with the targets that this system achieves,\" he said.\nScholz sees no reason to reconsider this position, his spokesman said on Monday, reaffirming what the chancellor said in his government declaration Wednesday. Scholz continues to receive backing for his course from his party. The delivery of Taurus is out of the question, said SPD leader Saskia Esken: \"We will stick to that.\"\nIn March, the CDU parliamentary group brought a motion calling for the deliveries before the Bundestag. At the time, the parliamentary groups of the SPD, Greens and FDP voted against it unanimously \u2014 in face of opposition from FDP politicians Marie-Agnes Strack-Zimmermann and Wolfgang Kubicki. The motion failed.\nShould the FDP table another motion and should it be adopted, it would still be nonbinding. It is not the Bundestag that decides on arms deliveries, but the Federal Security Council, a secret Cabinet committee chaired by the chancellor.\nThis article was originally written in German.\nWhile you're here: Every Tuesday, DW editors round up what is happening in German politics and society.

Russian media is reporting that according to the Kremlin, the call was initiated by Germany.\nThe German government will be keen to avoid any accusations that Berlin is trying to strike a deal with Moscow over Ukraine\u2019s head, particularly given painful 20th century memories in eastern Europe of Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union carving up the region between them.\nIn a written statement, the chancellor\u2019s office highlighted that Scholz also talked to Zelensky before the call to Putin. Scholz also planned to talk to Zelensky again once the call was over to give details about the conversation with the Russian president.\nIn a statement from the Kremlin to Russian media, Putin reportedly told Scholz that Russian-German relations had suffered \"an unprecedented degradation across the board as a result of the German authorities \"unfriendly course\u201d.\nAccording to the Kremlin, Putin told Scholz that any potential peace agreement must \u201cbe based on the new territorial realities\u201d \u2014 in other words the Ukrainian territory that Russia has occupied since 2022.\nPutin also said a peace deal could only happen by removing \u201cthe root causes of the conflict\u201d. The Kremlin justifies its invasion of Ukraine with the accusation of Nato \u201cexpansion\u201d into eastern Europe.\nIn the call, Putin reportedly said \u201cthe current crisis was a direct result of Nato's years-long aggressive policy aimed at creating in Ukrainian territory an anti-Russian bridgehead\u201d.\nIn an interview on German television last Sunday, Scholz said he was planning to talk to Putin to push for peace talks. He said he was not acting on his own, but rather in consultation with others.\nThere is speculation that Scholz is planning to also talk to the Chinese president Xi Jinping, a lukewarm supporter of Russia, about the war in Ukraine at the G20 next week in Rio de Janeiro.\nThe last time Scholz talked to Putin on the phone was on 2 December 2022. They last met in person a week before the full invasion of Ukraine.\nAt the time, Scholz returned to Berlin with promises from Putin that Russia did not intend to invade Ukraine. The attack a week later was the final break in trust between Germany and Russia.\nFor decades, Berlin had tried to ensure peace with Moscow by binding the two countries together with trade and energy links. That aspiration shattered overnight when Russia launched its full invasion of Ukraine.\nToday, Germany is the largest donor of military and financial aid to Ukraine after the US, and mainstream politicians from across the political spectrum, as well as most voters, favour supporting Ukraine.\nBut with elections in Germany now due in February, pressure is growing for serious peace negotiations to end the war in Ukraine.\nThe far-right AfD and the new far-left populist BSW, which together could win between a quarter and third of votes in the election, accuse the government of not doing enough to bring about a peace deal.\nScholz\u2019s governing coalition collapsed last week and he now runs a minority government until the elections. Both he and his party are doing badly in the polls.\nGermany has been hit hard by the war in Ukraine, both politically and economically.\nSo any sign that Scholz is helping to end the conflict could turn around his fortunes at the ballot box.\nAfter 50 years of brutal rule over Syria, Bashar al-Assad and his family have fled to Russia.\nA coroner rejects claims former soldier Daniel Burke of Manchester was accidentally shot by his comrade.\nThe Kremlin says the strikes were in response to Kyiv using US-made missiles to attack its territory.\nMark Rutte urged members to \"turbocharge\" their defence spending to prevent future war with Russia.\nThe presents have been donated by people from the city and beyond.\nCopyright 2024 BBC.

It's not what I would have liked,\" he said.\nPointing to the grim anniversary that the day brought, Scholz railed against fellow G20 leader, Russian President Vladimir Putin, \"1,000 days in which people have had to suffer for his blind megalomania, for his scheme to enlarge his territory simply through violence.\"\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron meanwhile urged\u00a0Russian President Vladimir Putin to \"listen to reason\" at the summit, at a relatively rare event still involving senior Russian representation in Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov.\n\"I truly want to call on Russia to listen to reason here. As a permanent member of the United Nations Security Council it has responsibilities,\" he said, accusing Russia of becoming, \"a force for global destabilization.\"\nDuring a bilateral meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping \u2014 a key ally of Putin's \u2014 Macron told reporters he had urged his Chinese counterpart to \"use all his influence\" to push the Russians toward de-escalation.\nXi has \"the capacity to negotiate with President Putin so that he halts his attacks\" on Ukraine and reconsiders his new nuclear stance, said Macron.\nThe French president said he also broached neighboring North Korea's decision to support Putin's invasion during his talks with\u00a0Xi.\nDespite his dissatisfaction with the final communique's comments on Ukraine, German Chancellor Scholz defended his own prior decision to withhold delivery of longer-distance missiles to Kyiv, saying it was the right choice.\nScholz pointed out that Germany is and will remain Ukraine's biggest individual supporter in Europe. At the same time, he underscored what he said was the importance of \"acting with prudence.\"\nScholz said he opposed delivering long-range missiles early on and that he was right to do so as this would have forced German troops to get involved in target selection deep inside Russia, saying, \"I don't think it would be right\" to participate in the conflict like that.\nTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video\nAlthough he appreciated G20 calls for a cease-fire in Gaza, Scholz said he \"regretted\" that the communique did not address Israel's right to defend itself in the face of threats from Hamas, Hezbollah and Iran as the conflict in the Middle East continues to spread. He was also unhappy that the paper failed to place blame for the spread of the conflict on the militant Islamist group Hamas.\n\"I very much regret that there was no consensus. It would have done the situation good if we had said: everything started with a horrific and brutal terrorist attack on Israel.\"\nThe US, EU, Japan and several other nations have named Hamas a terrorist organization.\nUltimately, said Scholz, \"it is becoming clear how much geopolitical tensions are also having an impact on the G20\u2026 The wind blowing in international relations is getting harsher.\"\nThe leaders' declaration included several aspects based on the priorities of the Brazilian presidency of the group, such as the fight against hunger and climate change as well as reform of global governance.\nIt reaffirmed the Paris Agreement to limit global warming to 1.5 C and called for\u00a0a substantial \"scaling up of climate finance from billions to trillions from all sources\" to support the transition to green energy.\nUS President Joe Biden used the final day of talks to announce\u00a0hundreds of millions of dollars in new climate and development pledges.\nThe G20 also stated an intent to make the UN Security Council more representative.\njs/rt (AFP, Reuters, AP)",

US President Joe Biden, who made the policy change, is also present at the summit.\nMacron acknowledged that the policy\u00a0change was triggered by North Korea sending troops to aid Russia in its war in Ukraine, a move from Moscow that was\u00a0\"a grave change in the conflict which shouldn't be underestimated,\" the French president said.\nHe added that Russia was \"the only power making an escalation in this conflict today\" with the North Korean mobilization. \"So it's really a sudden change in this war that led to the Americans' decision.\"\nGerman Chancellor Olaf Scholz was asked at the G20 summit in Rio de Janeiro on Monday about the supply of German long-range missiles to Ukraine.\nIn Germany's case, Taurus cruise missiles would be the relevant weaponry, something Berlin has not sent to Ukraine.\n\"I have\u00a0explained very clearly why I do not think it is right to supply Taurus cruise missiles,\" Scholz said on the sidelines of the G20 summit in Brazil.\nHe\u00a0said it was important to support Ukraine's defense against Russia's full-scale invasion while still acting \"prudently.\"\nThe missiles could only be used if \"responsibility for targeting\" was shared, Scholz said, a move he has previously said would risk the perception of direct German participation in the war.\n\"That is something that I cannot take responsibility for,\" Scholz said Monday in Rio de Janeiro. \"We have a clear understanding that the powerful weapons we have supplied so far, the long-range artillery, the rocket launchers, cannot be used to penetrate deep into the Russian hinterland.\"\nTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video\nWith snap elections looming in Germany, Scholz also faces a weakened situation domestically and the risk of further damage to the upcoming campaign, with a strong pacifist tradition in postwar Germany that was often particularly prevalent in what his Social Democrats would consider their supporter base, for instance the major trade unions.\nRussian opposition activist Vladimir Kara-Murza believes it is \"counterproductive to engage in any sort of business as usual with Vladimir Putin\" and that the \"only strategic solution [to Russian aggression] is to have a change of government in Russia.\"\nSpeaking to DW at the protest staged by exiled Russians in Berlin on Sunday, Kara-Murza criticized the decision by German Chancellor\u00a0Olaf Scholz to speak to Russian President Vladimir Putin on the phone on Friday and any suggestion of cutting a deal with the Kremlin.\n\"We hear such voices in the West \u2026 voices [which] claim that this is a road to peace,\" he said. \"They couldn't be more wrong on this. If there is some sort of a deal that is cut with Putin over the head of Ukraine without taking in consideration the interests of Ukraine, this will not lead to peace.\"\nFor Kara-Murza, a former ally of murdered Russian\u00a0dissident\u00a0Boris Nemtsov and vice-chairman of the now-outlawed NGO Open Russia, regime change in Moscow is the only option.\n\"Only when Russia has a democratically elected, legitimate government that respects the rights and freedoms of its own people, [will it] also respect the civilized norms of international behavior,\" he said.\n\"Only then will Russia stop being a threat both to itself and to the outside world.\"\nRussian opposition activist Vladimir Kara-Murza has described the recent phone call between German Chancellor Olaf Scholz and Russian President Vladimir Putin as \"symbolic\" \u2014 and not in a good way.\n\"History has shown very clearly what the appeasement of dictators leads to,\" he told DW during an anti-Putin protest staged by exiled Russians in Berlin on Sunday, pointing out that Russia conducted one of its largest bombardments of Ukrainian cities just two days later.\nKara-Murza, who was released from Russian jail as part of the majorprisoner swap in August this year,\u00a0compared the West's attempts to deal with Putin's Russia over the last 20 years to the appeasement of Adolf Hitler and the Nazis in Germany in the 1930s.\n\"What is seen as compromise by the leaders of democratic nations is seen as weakness by dictators,\" he said.\n\"This policy of Western appeasement towards Putin was in a large part responsible for the war of aggression that Putin unleashed in Ukraine, because appeasement of dictators always leads to more aggression.\"\nUS President Joe Biden has urged the leaders of G20 countries to support Ukraine\u2019s sovereignty.\n\"The United States strongly supports Ukraine's sovereignty and territorial integrity. Everyone around this table in my view should as well,\" Biden said in his opening remarks at his final G20 summit.\nRussian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov is also attending the summit that is taking place in Rio de Janeiro.\nThe comment comes after Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskyy seemingly appeared to confirm US media reports that the White House had quietly lifted its ban on Kyiv using US-made long-range weapons to strike inside Russian territory.\nBiden and his government are yet to publicly confirm this.\nHungarian Foreign Minister\u00a0Peter Szijjarto called the relaxation of restrictions on weapons sent to Ukraine by the US is\u00a0\"astonishly dangerous.\"\nHe urged against NATO member states allowing their weapons to be used inside Russian territory.\nAlthough Hungary is a member of both the EU and NATO, Prime Minister Viktor Orban has caused outrage amongst allies for being friendly to Moscow in recent years, going so far as to visit Russia in July for talks with\u00a0President Vladimir Putin.\nDW spoke with retired US Army Lieutenant General Ben Hodges, the former commander of the US Army in Europe, about the change in US policy.\n\"This will enable Ukraine to strike Russian and North Korean headquarters, logistics and artillery that will help disrupt Russian preparations for their attack... that'll be the immediate tactical benefit which will undermine the Russian advantage,\" he said, adding that the move \"significantly degrades Russia's ability to continue its meat grinder tactics.\"\nHodges said that the decision also\u00a0\"increases pressure on Germany to reconsider its very restrictive policy about Taurus.\"\n\"This tells the Russians that the United States we are not turning our back on Ukraine and that their hope that we would just quit is going to fail.\"\nYou can watch the full interview here.\nTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video\nThe office of Chancellor Scholz has said that despite support for the US decision from Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock, Germany had not changed its mind about delivering long-range missiles to Ukraine.\n\"The chancellor's decision is unchanged,\" a spokesman said when asked about sending German Taurus missiles to Kyiv.\nBerlin's position has long been that such a move would draw Germany too deep into the conflict.\nThe European Union has announced that it is widening sanctions against the government\u00a0in Tehran over its support for the Russian military.\nAt a foreign ministers meeting, the bloc decided to prohibit any transactions with ports\u00a0\"used for the transfer of Iranian UAVs or missiles or related technology and components to Russia.\"\nIran-made ballistic missiles are a key component of Russia's war in Ukraine.\nGermany's top diplomat Annalena Baerbock said that backing Moscow \"must and will have consequences\" for Beijing, as doing so is a threat to Europe's \"core security interests.\"\nShe did not give further details on what the consequences for China's alleged funneling of spy drones to Russia might be, but said the European Union was preparing fresh sanctions on Iran for giving the Kremlin ballistic missiles.\nAn unnamed EU official told German news agency DPA that reports of direct\u00a0Chinese military aid were \"extremely worrying,\" but that there was no hard evidence of\u00a0it yet.\nKremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said that President Joe Biden was further inflaming tensions with his decision to allow Kyiv to use American long-range weapons in Russia.\n\"It's obvious that the outgoing administration in Washington intends to take steps in order to continue fuelling the fire and provoking further escalation of tensions,\" he said.\nEuropean leaders have expressed their support for the call from Washington to drop restrictions on Ukraine using long-range missiles supplied by\u00a0Western allies inside Russia.\n\"The decision from the American side, and I would like to emphasize that this is not a rethink but an intensification of what has already been delivered by other partners, is so important at this moment,\" German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock said ahead of a summit for EU top diplomats in Brussels.\nHer French counterpart\u00a0Jean-Noel Barrot echoed her sentiments, saying\u00a0\"we openly said this was an option that we would consider if it was to allow to strike a target from where Russia is currently aggressing Ukrainian territory. So nothing new on the other side.\"\nOutgoing EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell added:\u00a0 \"I've been saying once and again that Ukraine should be able to use the arms we provided to them, in order to not only stop the arrows but also to be able to hit the archers.\"\n\"I continue believing this is what has to be done. I'm sure we will discuss once again.

He is taking over from\u00a0Lieutenant General Oleksandr Pavliuk, who had been at the helm\u00a0of the land forces\u00a0since February 2024, also after in a major shake-up.\nThe move comes as\u00a0Ukrainian troops face manpower shortages.\n\"The main task is to increase noticeably the combat efficiency of our army, ensure the quality of servicemen training, and introduce innovative approaches to people management in Ukraine's Armed Forces,\" Zelenskyy said.\n\"The Ukrainian army needs internal changes to achieve our state's goals in full,\" he said on Telegram after meeting his top military and government officials.\nDrapatyi is said to be well respected in the Ukrainian army. He had taken command of the Kharkiv front in May and managed to stop the Russian offensive in the northeast, stabilizing the front.\nGerman Chancellor Olaf Scholz held a phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, where Scholz sought to reassure Ukraine of Germany's continued solidarity.\n\"We will continue our military support for Ukraine in close coordination with our European and international partners,\" Scholz said in a post on\u00a0X\u00a0after the call.\nHe said he had agreed with Zelenskyy to remain in contact \"also with a view to possible paths to a just peace\"\u00a0to end Russia's ongoing invasion of Ukraine.\nFor his part, Zelenskyy thanked Scholz for Germany's help and support, particularly with air defense weapons, in a post on his Telegram channel.\nThe Ukrainian president\u00a0said that Scholz had also discussed\u00a0the details of his recent telephone conversation with Russian President Vladimir Putin.\n\"It is obvious that only the strength of arms and the strength of diplomacy can force the perpetrator of the war to make peace and that this peace can only be achieved through strength,\" Zelenskyy said.\nRussia sentenced jailed former Moscow city councilor Alexei Gorinov to three additional years in prison for criticizing Russia's offensive in Ukraine.\nHe is already serving a seven-year prison sentence for public criticism of the invasion.\nOn Friday, a court in the city of Vladimir, some 198 kilometers (123 miles) northeast of Moscow, handed him the new sentence on charges of \"justifying terrorism\" and ordered that he be transferred to a maximum-security prison.\n\"I am for peace and you like war,\" Gorinov said after the sentence was announced, according to Russian independent news portal Mediazona.\nThe court accused Gorinov of delivering a speech calling for Moscow to end the war in Ukraine and convince inmates to adopt an \"ideology of terrorism.\"\n\"Let's stop this slaughter that nobody needs \u2014 not us, not the citizens of Ukraine,\" Gorinov said in a video recorded in a prison hospital, according to the court.\n\"The guilt that I have is that I, as a citizen of my country, let this war happen and was not able to stop it.\"\nGerman Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock is set to visit China next week, where she will discuss issues such as the war in Ukraine, a ministry spokesperson said.\nWestern leaders have accused China of supporting Russia's war effort by providing dual-use items. Russia saw a surge in Chinese imports starting in 2023.\nChina has not imposed sanctions on Russia and has called for a negotiated settlement to the war.\nThe director of the International Campaign to Ban Landmines (ICBL), Tamar Gabelnick, said that a US offer to provide Kyiv with anti-personnel mines has thrown a global treaty into \"crisis.\"\nUkraine is one of the 164 signatories to the Anti-Personnel Mine Ban Convention. The United States is not party to the treaty.\nWhile speaking at a meeting of signatories in the Cambodian city of Siem Reap, Gabelnick said that the ICBL hoped \"the mines offered by the US will be firmly rejected by Ukraine.\"\nUkrainian defense official Yevhenii Kivshyk said at the same conference that that Kyiv's delegation had \"heard some concerns raised by the community\" that \"will be conveyed to the government of Ukraine.\"\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has called Washington's offer \"very important\"\u00a0for fending off Russian attacks.\nThe international ban on landmines, known as the Ottawa Treaty, was signed in 1997 and prohibits the use, stockpiling, manufacturing or transfer of the weapons.\nTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video\nIn a statement last week, ICBL warned of the \"human cost\" of the potential anti-personnel mine transfer from Washington.\n\"Ukraine already faces decades of demining work due to extensive Russian landmine use. Adding new mines to this contamination will only extend the suffering of civilians and complicate post-conflict recovery efforts,\" the group stressed.\nRussian Defense Minister Andrei Belousov arrived in Pyongyang for talks with North Korean officials and lauded expanding military cooperation between the two countries.\nBelousov said that a strategic partnership signed between North Korea and Russia in June aimed to lower the risk of war by maintaining a \"balance of power\" in the region.\nNorth Korean Defense Minister No Kwang-chol called Russia's war effort in Ukraine a \"just struggle to protect the country's sovereign rights and security interests.\"\nAs Belousov arrived in Pyongyang, North Korean military officials were seen clapping under a banner that read: \"Complete support and solidarity with the fighting Russian army and people.\"\nBelousov is a former economist and replaced Sergei Shoigu as defense minister in May.\nThe Russian official's visit comes days after South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol met with Ukrainian Defense Minister Rustem Umerov in Seoul.\nEarlier this month, Ukraine reported its forces' first clash with North Korean troops who had been deployed to the Russian border region of Kursk.\nThe Ukrainian military said it struck an oil depot in the Rostov region in Russia's northern Caucasus.\n\"Atlas is part of the Russian military-industrial complex that supplies petroleum products to the Russian army,\" Ukraine's military said on the Telegram messaging service.\nAccording to the same statement, Kyiv also struck a radar station used in Russian air defense in Ukraine's southern Zaporizhzhia region.\nZaporizhzhia is one of the four Ukrainian regions Russia claimed to have annexed in September 2022.\nFormer German Chancellor Angela Merkel called for Ukraine and its allies to consider diplomatic solutions to end the war with Russia.\n\"Russia must not win this war,\" Merkel stressed in an interview with German broadcaster ZDF, adding that Moscow's invasion was a \"blatant violation of international law.\"\nMerkel said that she worked to prevent escalation of tensions with Moscow during her time as chancellor from 2005 to 2021.\nIt is \"not only in the interest of Ukraine but also in our interest that [Russian President Vladimir Putin] does not win this war,\" she said.\nTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video\nHowever, Merkel also stressed the need to \"always consider diplomatic solutions in parallel\" to continued military support.\nShe said Kyiv and its allies will have to decide together when \"the right time\" has come for negotiations.\nMerkel said she supported the government of German Chancellor Olaf Scholz's policies on Ukraine, stressing that Berlin is one of Kyiv's biggest supporters.\n\"I support everything the international community is doing to put Ukraine in a good position,\" she said, adding that it would not be easy for Kyiv to achieve military victory against Moscow.\nsdi/zc (AFP, AP, dpa, Reuters)",

For now, Scholz said, the priority was providing Ukraine as much military assistance as possible.\nIn terms of the prospect of ceasefire talks or implementation, he said Ukraine first needed to make clear what its goals for a peace deal would be.\n\"No decision should be made above Ukraine's head,\"\u00a0Scholz said, while also warning that a potential deal must not amount to a\u00a0\"dictated peace.\"\nHowever, Scholz also voiced confidence in the chances of a continued, united NATO policy on Ukraine after the change in occupancy at the White House.\nHe said his recent phone call with Donald Trump had shown him\u00a0\"that it is possible for us to develop\u00a0our policies together so that Ukraine can have a positive outlook.\"\nScholz will likely be leaving his post as chancellor fairly soon after Trump's inauguration, with early elections set for late February in Germany.\nAhead of his meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, NATOSecretary General Mark Rutte said the priority for Wednesday's meeting was to \"make sure that Ukraine has what it needs\"\u00a0to prevent Russia and its president Vladimir Putin from winning the war.\nRutte declined to comment on what a potential ceasefire might look like, amid speculation of a change in course after Donald Trump's inauguration, saying it was important to first \"focus on the business at hand.\"\nRutte, the Netherlands' prime minister until July, has been filling the role as NATO's secretary general since October.\nNot for the first time in recent months, a short-notice appearance from Ukraine's Volodymyr Zelenskyy has somewhat stolen the show from the original main event.\nHowever, Wednesday's talks in Brussels are first and foremost, at least nominally, the latest of several summits on the slow process to usher six Western Balkan countries \u2014\u00a0Albania, Bosnia,\u00a0Kosovo, Montenegro, North Macedonia and Serbia \u2014\u00a0towards EU membership.\nDW's senior correspondent in Brussels Bernd Riegert does not expect any major movement on the issue:\nYet another Western Balkan summit is taking place here in Brussels, but no concrete decisions are on the table. No accession date will be given to any of the six countries.\nSome of the six leaders are not satisfied that they might yet have to wait years for an accession date. Some are actually getting impatient. Some leaders are frustrated that nothing has actually happened, and also that the EU does not appear fit to take in new members.\nAt the summit, the EU will seek to reassure the West Balkan countries that they are still most welcome, also for geopolitical reasons after Russia's aggression against Ukraine. We may hear warm words, but expect little real progress.\nNATO Secretary General Mark Rutte told reporters in Brussels on Wednesday that a NATO command in Wiesbaden in western Germany set up to assist Ukraine and provide training for its troops was now functional.\n\"The NATO command in Wiesbaden for security assistance and training for Ukraine is now up and running,\"\u00a0Rutte said.\nWiesbaden is also home to a major US Army base. Plans for the facility first emerged late in 2022, just a few months after Russia's invasion.\nUkraine's\u00a0President Volodymyr Zelenskyy will meet NATO\u00a0chief Mark Rutte and other key European leaders in Brussels to discuss the \"next steps\" in Russia's war, as Italy's Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni put it.\nThe evening's gathering was expected to involve leaders from Germany, Poland, Italy, Denmark and the EU.\nZelenskyy said\u00a0the leaders would discuss \"how to urgently strengthen Ukraine on the battlefield, politically and geopolitically.\" NATO, meanwhile, said the talks would focus on continued support for Ukraine, particularly in terms of air defense.\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron and British Prime Minister Keir starmer are set to miss the meeting due to schedule clashes, but said they would send\u00a0their foreign ministers instead.\nThe meeting comes just over a month before US President-elect Donald Trump moves into the White House, amid uncertainty on his approach to Ukraine.\nTrump has repeatedly said he would bring a swift\u00a0end to the conflict between Ukraine and Russia, without elaborating on how, prompting concerns he may\u00a0pull US support from Kyiv to force the country to make concessions to Moscow.\nRussian authorities said on Wednesday that they had detained an Uzbek citizen\u00a0after a senior general was killed by a bomb hidden in an electric scooter.\n\"A national of Uzbekistan, born in 1995, was arrested on suspicion of having committed the attack that cost the life of the commander of Russian radiological, chemical and biological defense forces, Igor Kirillov, and his assistant, Ilya Polikarpov,\" the Investigative Committee said in a statement.\nIt claimed that the 29-year-old suspect had admitted being \"recruited by Ukrainian special forces,\" while Russia's state TASS news agency said the man had been offered $100,000 and travel to the European Union.\nUkraine has also claimed responsibility for the killing.\nYou can read the full story here.",

            "content": "German military aid for Ukraine is stalling ahead of the Bundestag elections. A dispute within the government is preventing further funds from being released for weapons.\nFor Germany's Green Party, the issue is clear: A further aid package for Ukraine could be passed before the parliamentary election on February 23 \u2013 even though a budget for 2025 has not yet been approved. The package would include \u20ac3 billion ($3.1 billion) worth of weapons, primarily for Ukraine's air defense.\nIn fact, delivering weapons is not what is being disputed in Germany's current minority government, a coalition of Chancellor Olaf Scholz's Social Democratic Party (SPD) and the Greens, but rather its financing and timing.\nFollowing the breakup of the \"traffic light\" coalition last year, the German parliament was unable to pass a federal budget for 2025. \"The 2025 budget is not there, so the question of where the money should come from is justified,\" said Economy Minister Robert Habeck, who is also the Green Party's chancellor candidate.\nHabeck believes there is still a chance to make the funds available: The Bundestag's budget committee could make a decision to take on more debt. The aid package for Ukraine could then be passed before the election. \"It has been proven often enough that Putin exploits weakness. That is why permanent financing is necessary,\" Habeck emphasized.\nThe Greens say that Scholz is blocking the new aid package. The chancellor, however, does not want to be accused of not providing Ukraine with sufficient support: \"As everyone knows, Germany is Ukraine's biggest supporter and will remain so \u2014 so that the country can defend its independence and sovereignty,\" he said this week at the NATO summit of the Nordic countries in Helsinki.\nTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video\nThere may be some electioneering going on here: Scholz is also currently fighting for votes as the SPD's leading candidate for the upcoming election, and the SPD's members and party supporters are growing war-weary:\u00a0The willingness to continue spending billions on arms deliveries is waning, given Germany's economic problems and tight budget.\nThat is why Scholz is currently portraying himself as a \"peace chancellor.\" At a recent SPD conference in Berlin, he emphasized the need for \"real negotiations that finally put an end to the death and destruction in Ukraine.\" He said Germans could rely on him to remain \"sober-minded.\" He promised\u00a0he would ensure that \"we are not dragged into this war,\" despite his support for Ukraine\u00a0and repeatedly emphasized that that support would not come at the expense of German citizens.\nThere is, however, a lack of funds in the public coffers for further arms deliveries. At a\u00a0campaign event in Bielefeld on Monday, Scholz emphasized, \"I'm against us taking this from pensions, I'm against us doing this through cuts to local authorities, I'm against us investing less money in railroads and roads.\"\nOne of the next government's first tasks will be to create a budget for the current year\u00a0and Scholz insists that any calls for new weapons funding must \"also say where the money will come from.\"\nGreen politicians\u00a0like Bundestag member Anton Hofreiter\u00a0believe that any government policy that ties a \u20ac3 billion Ukrainian aid package to social spending cuts in Germany would be a cop-out.\nFurther aid for Ukraine would not only serve the Greens' interests, but also those of Defense Minister Boris Pistorius, who is intent on showing Germany's support for Ukraine. The SPD politician traveled to Kyiv on Tuesday for an unannounced visit, where he stressed that Germany would continue to stand by Ukraine.\nWith only one week to go until Donald Trump is\u00a0inaugurated as US president, Pistorius' visit was also designed to send yet another signal of support. Kyiv fears that Trump might drastically reduce US aid, which may mean that European countries are forced to increase their support fast.\nThe German opposition, which includes the\u00a0Christian Democratic Union (CDU), the\u00a0Christian Socialist Union (CSU)\u00a0and now also the Free Democratic Party (FDP), is\u00a0not against a new military aid package per se \u2014 it's\u00a0against taking on any additional debt. The parties\u00a0are therefore proposing parallel spending cuts, for instance, to Germany's unemployment benefits.\nThe SPD rejects such a proposal. With this impasse, it appears highly unlikely that a new aid package for Ukraine will be passed before the impending Bundestag elections.\nThis article was translated from German.\nWhile you're here: Every Tuesday, DW editors round up what is happening in German politics and society.

            "content": "During their election campaign, Germany's conservatives have prioritized defense spending and supplying more arms to Ukraine. Though they are polling well, their proposals do not reflect the priorities of German voters.\nThe joint election manifesto for the Christian Democrats (CDU) and their Bavarian allies, the Christian Social Union (CSU) includes security guarantees for Ukraine that Germany could make good on\u00a0along with the US and its European partners in NATO.\n\"Ukraine also defends us,\" the manifesto reads. \"If Ukraine falls, there is the threat of an attack on another EU country.\"\nThe CDU and CSU consider it possible that Germany would participate in negotiations toward a ceasefire in Ukraine, even if that were to mean the deployment of Bundeswehr soldiers to keep the peace. Politicians for the parties are reluctant to talk about that part, as security is not a high priority for voters in February's election.\nThe greatest skepticism about further arms deliveries to Ukraine comes from eastern Germany and the wealthy southern state of Bavaria.\nSo far, the government, led by Chancellor Olaf Scholz, of\u00a0the center-left Social Democrats\u00a0(SPD), has refused to supply Taurus cruise missiles on the grounds that Ukraine could use them to hit targets within Russia, which would make Germany a party to the war.\nThe US, the UK and France have already supplied similar longer-range weapons that allow Ukraine to strike targets across the border.\nThe argument that Germany should not allow itself to be drawn into the war was also used by Bavarian State Premiere Markus S\u00f6der, of the CSU, at his election campaign launch in Seeon.\nBut S\u00f6der did not respond to a question from\u00a0DW about Taurus missiles, saying the decision would be up to the next chancellor.\nThomas Erndl, a CSU deputy who sits on the Bundestag's foreign affairs committee, told DW that \"the opinion has become entrenched among the population that arms deliveries fuel war, while stopping deliveries slows it down.\"\n\"We have to contend with this mood,\"\u00a0Erndl\u00a0said.\nThe CDU's candidate for chancellor,\u00a0Friedrich Merz, has publicly declared his willingness to supply Taurus missiles, but only in consultation with European NATO\u00a0partners. However, the CDU/CSU election manifesto stakes out no clear position on the issue.\nIn contrast, the neoliberal Free Democrats (FDP) are\u00a0\u00a0in favor of \"the immediate delivery of Taurus cruise missiles,\" while the SPD is clearly against it.\nHow decisively Germany's\u00a0next government will ultimately act largely depends on two factors.\nThe first has to do with the geopolitical dynamics after January 20, when Donald Trump will be sworn in as US president for the second time. Trump is likely to put considerable pressure on Germany, both economically and in terms of security policy.\nDecisions would have to be made more quickly, and more money would be needed, a high-ranking CDU politician from eastern Germany told DW. \"When the ceasefire in Ukraine comes,\" the politician said, \"we will have to pay for it.\"\nThe populist-presenting parties, the far-right Alternative for Germany and the Sahra Wagenknecht Alliance, have been particularly successful with their pro-Russia stance in eastern Germany.\nThe CDU and CSU have stated that they will not cave to Trump's demands that Germany spend\u00a05% of GDP on defense, noting that the United States does not spend that much either.\nThe policy platform states that Germany would spend\u00a02% of GDP on defense. The parties even advocate a target of\u00a03% in a country where the arms industry holds considerable political sway.\nThe second factor on which Germany's security policy depends is the question of the makeup of any future coalition government.\n\"If the CDU/CSU were to govern with the SPD, security policy would proceed with the handbrake on,\" Gustav Gressel, a former senior research fellow with the European Council of Foreign Relations whose areas of expertise include Russia and defense policy, told DW.\nGressel said he expected members of the SPD who \"continue the 'peace policy,' which is actually 'peace populism,'\" to join such a government.\n\"The SPD would then fall back into its old position and use the fear strategy to distance itself from its larger coalition partner,\" Gressel said.\nTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video\nMerz would likely face critics on foreign and security policy issues both from within the coalition through the SPD and within the CDU and CSU, he said.\nA coalition between the CDU/CSU and the Greens, the junior partners in the current government, could put Germany in a leading position in terms of security policy more quickly.\nThe Greens have done a complete U-turn on security policy since Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022. The party, which has many pacifists among its ranks, used to categorically reject arms deliveries to crisis regions.\nNow, the Greens are among the biggest supporters of military aid for Ukraine \u2014 including the delivery of weapons systems.\nThough Taurus cruise missiles would\u00a0not be a \"game changer\" in the war, Gressel said,\u00a0they have become a powerful symbol of German angst.\nChancellor Scholz has \"deliberately stirred up fear among the population with made-up\u00a0arguments,\" Gressel said.\nThere is little doubt among experts and within the CDU/CSU that Germany would supply the Taurus missiles to Ukraine with Merz as chancellor as part of an overall effort to appear\u00a0more robust on foreign policy than his predecessor.\nThis article was originally written in German.\nWhile you're here: Every Tuesday, DW editors round up what is happening in German politics and society.

            "content": "German chancellor grapples with Ukraine issue as election campaign heats up.\nGerman Chancellor Olaf Scholz blocked a proposal for an additional \u20ac3 billion aid package for weapons to Ukraine, according to a local media report.\nThe plan, revealed by\u00a0Spiegel, was introduced by Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock of the Greens and Defense Minister Boris Pistorius from Scholz\u2019s Social Democratic Party. It sought to provide Ukraine with critical weapons systems, including three additional Iris-T air defense batteries, 10 howitzers and more artillery ammunition.\nAccording to the report, the aid package was developed immediately following the collapse of the coalition government in November, with Baerbock and Pistorius aiming to secure parliamentary approval for the funding before February's snap federal elections.\nTheir ministries had justified the request by citing Ukraine's deteriorating military situation, compounded by doubts over continued U.S. support following Donald Trump\u2019s election victory. Baerbock and Pistorius framed the proposal as a vital signal of Germany\u2019s unwavering support.\nDespite their efforts, Scholz remained opposed. The incumbent chancellor reportedly argued that existing military aid allocations \u2014 \u20ac4 billion for 2025, alongside funds from a $50 billion G7 loan financed by frozen Russian assets \u2014 are sufficient. He expressed concern over committing the incoming government to major financial obligations after the election.\nPOLITICO has contacted a chancellery spokesperson for comment on the story.\nPolitical considerations also loom large. The SPD leader is said to fear alienating voters with additional arms deliveries amid a contentious election campaign season. By contrast, the Greens have sought to leverage their support for increased defense spending as an electoral asset.\nDespite the blockade, Pistorius reaffirmed Germany\u2019s broader commitments during the Ukraine Defense Contact Group meeting at the U.S. Air Base in Ramstein on Thursday. He announced that Germany will supply around\u00a050 guided missiles for IRIS-T\u00a0air defense systems, originally intended for the Bundeswehr but redirected to Ukraine directly from production.\n\u201cWe will supply Ukraine first before replenishing our own stocks,\u201d Pistorius said, assuring that Ukraine could still rely on Germany, regardless of the outcome of the upcoming election.\nHans von der Burchard contributed to this report.\nBeleaguered chancellor says more aid to Ukraine could mean cuts to pensions and local government funding.\nGermany\u2019s rulers are facing mounting security risks as suspicious drone activity intensifies over military and industrial sites.\nThe incident comes as far-right leaders are embracing increasingly radical proposals to deport migrants en masse ahead of a national election.",

            "summary": "Germany's CDU party, leading in polls for the upcoming February 23 election, proposes cutting unemployment benefits for Ukrainian war refugees, arguing the current benefits discourage employment. The CDU/CSU suggests Ukrainians should receive lower asylum-seeker benefits instead of the standard citizens' income. This move is part of a broader plan to reform the welfare system aimed at integrating long-term unemployed into the labor market. Critics point to bureaucratic challenges and language barriers as significant obstacles for Ukrainians seeking work, while some conservatives believe welfare amounts contribute to the slow integration of refugees.",
            "content": "Germany's CDU party, currently the favorite to win Germany's upcoming election, wants to cut unemployment benefits for Ukrainian war refugees. The conservatives argue that the benefits discourage them from finding work.\nGermany's center-right Christian Democratic Union (CDU) and the Christian Social Union (CSU) \u2014 currently leading in polls ahead of the election on February 23 next year \u2014 want to cut welfare benefits and get more of the country's 5.5 million long-term unemployed into the labor market.\nThey are also openly questioning whether Ukrainians should receive the standard unemployment benefit, called B\u00fcrgergeld (\"citizens' income\") rather than the lower asylum-seeker benefits. Following Russia's full-fledged invasion of Ukraine, refugees arriving in Germany and were subject to an EU Council Directive for temporary protection in the event of a mass influx of displaced persons for whom the regular asylum procedures do not apply. They were granted temporary residency status and entitled to full social welfare benefits.\nThe CSU's Stephan Stracke, social policy spokesman for the CDU/CSU's parliamentary group, told DW that while anyone fleeing \"war and violence\" had a right to protection, \"This does not mean, however, that there must be an automatic entitlement to the citizen's income in Germany.\" Instead, Stracke said, newly arrived Ukrainian war refugees should receive asylum-seeker benefits \"at first.\"\nTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video\nGermany is currently home to around 1.2 million Ukrainian refugees, around 530,000 of whom are classified by the Federal Employment Agency as eligible to work and entitled to citizens' income (as of May 2024).\nThat means they receive an unemployment benefit of up to \u20ac563 ($596) per month plus their rent and heating costs paid by the state. There is an extra allowance for children, staggered by age, and around 360,000 of the Ukrainian refugees in Germany are children. Stracke's proposal \u2014 for Ukrainians to receive the standard asylum seekers' benefit instead \u2014 would mean that Ukrainians would receive only \u20ac460 per month.\nThe CDU's move is part of a general planned overhaul of the B\u00fcrgergeld system if they get into power, which will include tougher sanctions for refusing work and more mandatory visits to the authorities.\nThe tougher comments on Ukrainian refugees are not new among German conservatives: Two years ago, CDU leader Friedrich Merz, who is predicted to head Germany's next government questioned the Ukranians' need for protection: \"We are now experiencing a form of social tourism among these refugees: to Germany, back to Ukraine, to Germany, back to Ukraine,\" Merz told the Bild TV outlet in 2022, triggering widespread outrage.\nIn a newly updated study, the German Institute for Employment Research (IAB) found that Germany was struggling to integrate Ukrainians into the job market, at least compared with other countries \u2014 but also that the situation was improving: Only 27% of Ukrainians in Germany had found work as of March this year, compared to 57% in Lithuania and 53% in Denmark (though that was still ahead of Ukrainians in Norway, Spain, and Finland, where only around 20% had found work). \u2014 and finding childcare and schooling has become increasingly difficult.\nAccording to Germany's right-wing parties, like the CDU and the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD), the high number of refugees living off social welfare is partly down to the amount of money they receive. \"Germany has obviously not been particularly successful in getting Ukrainian refugees into work so far,\" said Stracke. \"Other European countries are doing much better. That is why we in Germany have to give more weight to the principle of supporting and challenging people to find work.\"\nBut the IAB study also shows that the proportion of Ukrainians in work is steadily rising in all the European countries \u2014 and that there is little evidence to show that there is a correlation with the amount of state help they receive. More significant factors than benefits, the IAB said, were language barriers and demand for labor in the low-wage sector, where it is easier to find work.\nIryna Shulikina, executive director at the Berlin-based NGO Vitsche, which supports Ukrainian refugees in Germany, said Ukrainians encounter several obstacles to finding work in Germany, most notably getting through the bureaucratic process. According to the IAB, some 72% of Ukrainian refugees have either a university degree or a vocational qualification \u2014 more than other refugees or the German working population in general.\n\"When they come here, they face the difficulties of getting their diplomas approved here,\" Shulikina said.\nTo name one example: Though Germany faces a shortage of medical workers, Shulikina said she had spoken to Ukrainian medical workers who needed two and a half years to get to the stage where they could work: Applying for work, getting their documents and qualifications approved, doing the necessary tests, learning the language. \"It's a real challenge,\" she said.\nTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video\nWhether a likely CDU-led government will succeed in changing conditions for Ukrainian refugees will depend also on its coalition partners: The center-left Social Democrats (SPD) are less inclined to crack down on social welfare recipients, while leading members of the neoliberal Free Democrats (FDP), have already expressed their support for recategorizing Ukrainian war refugees \u2014 even though the party's parliamentary group declined to state an official position to DW for this article.\nShulikina put the current political debate on the issue of B\u00fcrgergeld down to election campaigning and did not accept the argument that the citizens' income was keeping Ukrainian refugees at home.\n\"All the people I know who are refugees and have anything to do with the Job Center are doing everything possible to end this relationship,\" she said. \"It's very humiliating and annoying. You are very dependent, and you are not perceived as an equal part of society \u2014 you're asked about every cent you spend and how and when. I don't believe there are a lot of people who enjoy getting B\u00fcrgergeld.\"\nLyudmyla Mlosch, chairperson of the Central Council of Ukrainians in Germany (ZVUD), said many Ukrainians she knows in Germany don't want to be here at all. \"I know a lot of people here who are dreaming of going home, but they have no home \u2014 they've lost everything,\" said Mlosch. \"Of course they need support.\"\nBut Mlosch did admit that some Ukrainians are more desperate than others: Those from the regions in the east that are under almost continual bombardment from Russia are more in need of state help, for example, as are older or sick people, or people who have no savings. \"They don't need to all be put in the same bracket. But younger people who can work, they could have their money reduced, I could admit that,\" she said.\nEdited by Rina Goldenberg\nWhile you're here: Every Tuesday, DW editors round up what is happening in German politics and society.

Olaf Scholz's SPD is polling at 16.5%, trailed by the Greens at 11.5%, then the left-wing BSW party (8%), the\u00a0FDP (5%) and the Left Party (2.5%).\nTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video\nThis story was written\u00a0with additional reporting from DW's Michaela K\u00fcfner.\njs/jsi\u00a0(dpa, Reuters)",

Becoming the next chancellor may be a tall order for Habeck, but the Greens are hoping for a pre-vote boost.\nLawmakers from the Greens voted overwhelmingly in favor of Robert Habeck, Germany's\u00a0deputy chancellor and economy minister, running as the party's lead candidate in February's early federal election.\nHabeck won 741 of 768\u00a0votes, or 96.48%,\u00a0at the hastily-arranged\u00a0conference in Wiesbaden,\u00a0western Germany, on Sunday.\n\"With this speech I'm applying for permission to lead you in the election campaign,\" the 55-year-old former children's author told delegates before the vote.\nHabeck said he knew he'd lost trust among the public in recent years in the governing coalition, but said he\u00a0wanted to take responsibility as the party's \"candidate for the people in Germany.\"\nTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video\nAs the result was read out in\u00a0Wiesbaden, Habeck responded with a play on words in German that indicated his acceptance of the result and his desire to tackle the upcoming national election.\n\"We'll take [on] this vote,\"\u00a0he said.\nThe nomination means Habeck is the party's choice for chancellor, should it be in a position to field one.\nBut Habeck and the Greens have been open about this being a distant prospect, given that they are currently polling in the region of 11% or 12% support.\nHe did bring up the notion of getting all the way to the chancellery in Sunday's speech to delegates, which lasted around an hour, but stressed how this would only be possible if campaign momentum \"carries us very far.\"\nAhead of the conference, Habeck told DW that he hoped current polls could prove\u00a0misleading by February. All three members of the now-collapsed coalition had been suffering in the polls amid the public arguments, logjams\u00a0and compromises on policy as they tried to keep the fractious alliance together.\n\"All the disputes, all the compromises that we had to make are now gone. And now the parties are stepping forward with their own ideas. Now a lot can change on all fronts,\" he said.\nFour years ago, Habeck stepped aside to allow Annalena Baerbock, now foreign minister, to take a shot at the top job. She said earlier this year that she wanted to focus on her current post, partly given the fragile geopolitical situation, and that she had no ambition to run again. Habeck then made his intentions clear a few days ago.\nHe explicitly thanked Baerbock when addressing delegates after her on Sunday.\n\"It's a great privilege to know you're ahead of me, by my side and behind me,\" Habeck said to Baerbock.\nBaerbock, meanwhile, lauded Habeck as \"super pragmatic,\" saying he had managed to keep a steady course and free Germany from its dependence on Russian energy imports amid the crisis posed by Moscow's invasion of Ukraine, referring to policies that in some cases have angered parts of the party's ecologist base.\n\"Nobody can handle the rudder like Robert Habeck in a storm and at the same time set the sails correctly in a tailwind,\" she said.\nTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video\nOn Saturday, the opening day of the conference,\u00a0the pro-environment\u00a0party also appointed a new party leadership\u00a0duo: multilingual\u00a0foreign policy specialist Franziska Brantner and 35-year-old Felix Banaszak, a former co-chair of the party's youth wing who only joined the federal parliament after the last election\u00a0in 2021.\nThe Greens briefly led in the polls early in the 2021 campaign, but slipped drastically to finish a distant third, with\u00a014.7% support,\u00a0as Scholz's Social Democrats made a late surge which put them ahead of their traditional rivals, the\u00a0Christian Democrats.\nmsh/dj (AFP, dpa, Reuters)\nWhile you're here: Every Tuesday, DW editors round up what is happening in German politics and society.

            "content": "The Greens are set to confirm Robert Habeck as their top candidate, elect two new party leaders and map out a course to continue promoting their progressive agenda.\nIn the midst of very turbulent times, around 800 delegates from\u00a0Germany's Green Party are meeting in Wiesbaden from\u00a0November 15-17 for a party conference where they hope to reinvent themselves.\nRobert Habeck, the vice chancellor and economy minister in the minority government of Chancellor Olaf Scholz, is expected to be elected as the Greens' top candidate in the campaign.\nHabeck told DW that\u00a0the convention will be a forum to look ahead, rather than back. \"First of all, we have to talk about what is happening right now. All the crises, conflicts, and challenges: Why is there so much conflict?\"\nHe stressed that the Greens need to focus on the country's most pressing problems, such as the creation of more affordable housing and making electricity and heating cheaper. The Greens will\u00a0focus on these topics no matter whether they end up in government or in opposition, Habeck said.\nThe center-left coalition of Social Democrats (SPD), Greens\u00a0and the neoliberal Free Democratic Party (FDP) collapsed on November 6\u00a0after three years in office\u00a0and months of infighting about the 2025 budget. The ongoing conflicts in the government over climate action\u00a0and social and economic policy were a source of frustration, and there has been much discontent among the Green's base when they voted to tighten asylum and migration policies.\nAfter the early election\u00a0scheduled for February 23,\u00a0the Greens may well find themselves in the opposition again. However, Habeck has said he is not giving up hope of getting more than the 11% of votes, a result indicated by the most recent polls.\n\"All the disputes, all the compromises that we had to make are now gone. And now the parties are stepping forward with their own ideas. Now a lot can change on all fronts,\" said Habeck.\nSince the breakup of the coalition government, he pointed out, there has been a real sense of euphoria within the party,\u00a0which has been reflected in\u00a0a major influx of new members. Some 5,500 people have reportedly joined the Greens since the government fell apart, giving the environmental party 130,000 members \u2014 a new record.\nIndeed, Habeck has been extremely popular throughout his political career.\u00a0The philosophy major authored several books, joined the Green Party in 2002 and went on to become lawmaker and then agriculture minister in his northern home state of Schleswig Holstein.\nHabeck had a very favorable image with voters at the beginning of his term in office in 2021, with approval ratings much higher than those of the taciturn Chancellor Scholz. After the start of Russia's war of aggression against Ukraine, it was Habeck who found simple and heartfelt\u00a0words to explain the impact of rising energy prices and inflation to the German people.\nBefore 2018, Habeck was a co-chair of the Green Party alongside current Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock, but stepped aside to allow her to be candidate for chancellor in the 2021 election campaign. Following Baerbock's campaign, the Greens garnered 14.8% of the vote, which\u00a0made\u00a0them the third-largest party behind the Social Democrats and center-right Christian Democrats.\nBaerbock announced weeks ago that she would not be seeking the top job in the next election. She is expected to support Habeck in this campaign.\nTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video\nAfter poor showings in several recent elections, including in the European elections in June and in the three eastern German states in September, the party's leaders threw in the towel. Co-chairs Omid Nouripour and Ricarda Lang do not plan to run again for the party leadership.\nFelix Banaszak and Franziska Brantner are now expected to replace them.\nBanaszak, 35,\u00a0is a junior member of the Bundestag from Germany's most populous state of North Rhine-Westphalia. He hails from a working class family \u2014\u00a0his grandfather migrated from Poland to the Ruhr Valley, West Germany's former industrial heartland.\nBrantner, 45,\u00a0is a political scientist who was born and raised in Heidelberg.\u00a0She spent time in Tel Aviv and Washington, and has been a member of the lower house of parliament since 2013.\nShe currently serves as state secretary in the Economy Ministry,\u00a0and is said to be a close confidante of Habeck. Her candidacy has drawn the attention of Habeck's critics within the party. They accuse Habeck of seeking to force the party to toe his line and adopt his more pragmatic, centrist approach that encompasses a wide range of issues, in an attempt to appeal to people who have not previously voted for the Greens.\nIn an interview with the national daily S\u00fcddeutsche Zeitung, Brantner admitted that she is faced with a difficult mission: \"It's a big task, but one that reflects the times we live in.\"\nBoth candidates have made it clear that under their leadership, the Greens would once again focus on climate action. With Donald Trump as president, the US could no longer be counted on as a key partner for climate protection.\nHabeck is probably the Green Party's best-known politician. But he lost a lot of support during his time in the government due to his poorly communicated plans to switch German homes from gas to sustainable heat pumps.\nThe short election campaign leading up to February's election is likely to focus on him. However, not everyone is pleased with this, as many members of the Green Party see themselves as a party based on a political platform, not one in which personality is all that important.\nThis article was originally written in German.\nWhile you're here: Every Tuesday, DW editors round up what is happening in German politics and society.

Germany now faces a snap election in February 2025.\nGermany's neoliberal\u00a0Free Democratic Party (FDP)\u00a0plotted to collapse\u00a0Chancellor\u00a0Olaf Scholz's coalition government\u00a0two months before it fell apart, two German newspapers reported on Saturday.\nThe revelations come\u00a0as the country prepares for a snap election\u00a0in February, following the firing of FDP Finance Minister Christian Lindner\u00a0earlier this month. Lindner's widely reported plan to\u00a0lower\u00a0taxes, scrap\u00a0recent reforms and roll\u00a0back environment protection targets was deemed\u00a0a provocation by\u00a0his left-leaning coalition partners, and his party decided to\u00a0pull out of\u00a0the coalition. The coalition then collapsed\u00a0on November 6.\nHowever, the alliance between the FDP,\u00a0Scholz's center-left Social Democrats (SPD)\u00a0and the environmentally friendly Greens\u00a0had been unsteady for more than a year\u00a0due to ideological differences and disputes over the government budget.\nDie Zeit and S\u00fcddeutsche Zeitung\u00a0cited several sources as saying the FDP had drawn up a plan during secret talks in Potsdam in September to break away from the three-party coalition.\nLindner, who was fired by Scholz from his post\u00a0as finance minister after months of wrangling over the 2025 budget,\u00a0attended the talks, along with several other\u00a0FDP government ministers and\u00a0officials in the party's parliamentary faction, Die Zeit reported.\nTop of the agenda, according to the newspapers, was the future of the German coalition government and the future of the FDP.\nDie Zeit said what was discussed over the next few hours was \"the beginning of the end of the traffic light government,\" referring to the colors of the three parties: green, red, and yellow. The\u00a0FDP officials reportedly\u00a0drew up the first outlines of \"the\u00a0script for the overthrow of the government,\" known internally as\u00a0the \"D-Day\u00a0project.\"\nThe original D-Day marked the landing of Allied\u00a0troops in Normandy, France\u00a0in June\u00a01944, marking the beginning of the end of World War II and Germany's then-Nazi regime.\nTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video\nSeveral scenarios were\u00a0reportedly developed by the party's top leadership over the next two months, who eventually produced\u00a0a detailed\u00a0plan to exit\u00a0the coalition.\nDie Zeit said an economic policy paper was even drawn up, which the party knew would be unacceptable to the other coalition partners, who had been wracked by months of infighting.\nA timetable for the withdrawal of FDP ministers from the Cabinet was also discussed, the newspaper reported.\nThe FDP was at the time polling below 5%, a crucial threshold for any party to enter the lower house of parliament, the Bundestag.\nParty officials were also concerned the FDP could disappear into obscurity for the second time in a decade. Between 2009 and 2013, the party was a part of former Chancellor Angela Merkel's coalition, but then dropped below the 5% threshold and was left without seats in the national parliament.\nAccording to Die Zeit, Lindner made\u00a0it clear that he saw no hope for the\u00a0party if it remained\u00a0in government.\nResponding to the revelations, an\u00a0FDP spokesperson told DPA news agency:\u00a0\"We do not comment on internal meetings.\"\nThe spokesman added that assessments about the party's future in the coalition had taken place\u00a0\"repeatedly and in various rounds,\" ever since Germany's\u00a0Constitutional Court declared the coalition's 2021 supplementary budget\u00a0unconstitutional last November.\nThe supplementary budget was designed so Scholz's government could\u00a0move \u20ac60 billion ($63.25 billion) in unused COVID pandemic recovery funds\u00a0to bolster its climate and infrastructure investments.\n\"Of course, scenarios were considered again and again and opinions were gathered,\" the FDP\u00a0spokesman said.\nThe spokesman continued that Lindner had proposed two options to Scholz at\u00a0a meeting earlier this month.\nThese were \"an agreement on a realignment of economic policy or the orderly termination of the coalition through a joint path to new elections,\" he added.\nTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video\nAfter Lindner was dismissed on November 6, the same day Donald Trump was reelected as\u00a0US president, two of the three remaining FDP ministers in the federal government walked out, while another quit the party.\nThis left Scholz leading\u00a0a minority government, prompting calls for a\u00a0confidence vote in the government and an early election.\nAhead of February's likely federal vote, most pollsters are already predicting\u00a0a grand coalition between center-right CDU/CSU \u2014 Merkel's former alliance\u00a0\u2014 and Scholz's SPD as\u00a0likely.\nThe FDP is currently polling at 4%, according to a survey published Saturday by the INSA polling institute for Germany's largest mass circulation daily, Bild.\nmm/dj (DPA, Die Zeit)\nWhile you're here: Every Tuesday, DW editors round up what is happening in German politics and society.

Contrary to assertions made by figures like JD Vance, research indicates that the AfD is most popular in former East Germany, areas where the Nazi party (NSDAP) also had significant support in the 1930s. Studies show a generational continuation of right-wing tendencies, with socioeconomic factors also influencing the AfD's appeal. The AfD's rise reflects historical voting patterns rather than a direct link to resistance against Nazism.",
            "content": "Has the far-right AfD achieved its greatest electoral successes in the parts of Germany that previously resisted the Nazis? No, it hasn't \u2014 and here's why.\nFirst Elon Musk, now JD Vance. Prominent members of the incoming US government have been lending their support to the German far-right party,\u00a0Alternative for Germany (AfD).\nMusk, the world's richest man, and Vance, the designated US vice president\u00a0to Donald Trump, have both recently made highly polarizing statements.\nVance has criticized US media that described the AfD as being \"Nazi-lite\" because, he wrote on social media on\u00a0January 2, \"the AfD is most popular in the same areas of Germany that were most resistant to the Nazis.\"\nBut is that really true?\nClaim:\u00a0In a post on X (formerly Twitter)\u00a0that has now been accessed more than 7.8\u00a0million times, Vance claimed the\u00a0US media were slandering the AfD.\nDW fact check:\u00a0False. In fact, election results and other research\u00a0indicates\u00a0the opposite is true.\nIt is true that US media, including\u00a0The New York Times\u00a0and even Fox News, have on occasion linked the AfD with Germany's National Socialists, or Nazism. This partly has to do with the fact that\u00a0some AfD politicians have themselves used Nazi slogans. In 2021, AfD member Bj\u00f6rn H\u00f6cke, who formerly worked as a history teacher, was convicted of having publicly used Nazi dictator Adolf Hitler's slogan \"Everything for Germany\" (\"Alles f\u00fcr Deutschland\"), which is banned in Germany today.\nAlice Weidel, the national party's\u00a0co-chair, has said she sees\u00a0May 8, the date on which Germany was freed\u00a0from the Nazis, as the anniversary of the defeat of her country rather than its\u00a0liberation.\u00a0In addition, some state chapters of the AfD as well as its youth organization have been certified as right-wing extremist by a German intelligence service.\nVance has maintained\u00a0that the AfD is popular in regions that put up the most resistance to the Nazis.\nThe AfD is, indeed,\u00a0most popular in states in what was formerly known as East Germany.\u00a0At the last federal election\u00a0in 2021, the AfD was\u00a0victorious in getting locals' second vote in parts of the eastern states of Thuringia, Saxony-Anhalt and Saxony. Second votes are cast for a party, and determine how many seats each party receives in the German lower house, or Bundestag.\nAltogether, the AfD was particularly strong in the so-called \"new\" German states \u2014 that is, states that were formerly part of East Germany \u2014 such as Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania, Brandenburg, Saxony-Anhalt, Saxony and Thuringia. Only in Berlin, also one of the \"new\" states, did it win\u00a0fewer votes.\nIt's a similar picture when one looks at the German results of the European elections in June 2024. Here, too, the AfD was successful mostly in eastern regions. In Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania, Brandenburg, Saxony-Anhalt, Saxony and Thuringia, the AfD gleaned at least 27% of the vote, giving it\u00a0the biggest share\u00a0in those states. In all of Germany, the AfD received 15.9% of votes.\nIn the latest regional elections held in the above states, the AfD was particularly strong.\u00a0In\u00a0Berlin, the Greens were the strongest party at the 2024 European elections (19.6%), while the AfD received 11.6% of votes.\nIn terms of the upcoming\u00a02025 federal election, the AfD is popular but it's hard to know exactly where, because polls tend to document all of Germany and don't look in detail at\u00a0individual regions.\nSo where were the Nazis most popular? And where was most resistance to them\u00a0\u2014 was it in eastern Germany?\nThe party of Adolf Hitler, the National Socialist German Workers' Party (NSDAP), came to power in 1933. In the last Reichstag election before he took power, on November 6, 1932, the NSDAP came out the strongest with 33.1% of the vote.\nIf we look at the election results from German regions in 1932, the NSDAP received the biggest share of the vote in almost all of Germany, including in eastern Germany, in\u00a0the regions where many people vote for the AfD today.\nAt the Reichstag election in March 1933, the NSDAP was even stronger. However, this election is\u00a0described by historians as not free because\u00a0the NSDAP and its supporters intimidated voters, sometimes violently.\nThis is why Vance's claim is wrong. Hitler's NSDAP had Germany-wide support, including in those areas which favor the AfD today.\nAn as-yet unpublished study by researchers at\u00a0Ludwig Maximilian University in Munich, from which some excerpts are already available, has confirmed\u00a0this finding. The study analyzes\u00a0connections between districts in which many vote for the AfD today and those that strongly supported the NSDAP in 1933.\nThere was high voter support in 1933 for the NSDAP in the districts in which the AfD receives strong support today, Felix Hagemeister, a co-author of the study, told DW.\n\"It would be wrong to speak of any causality in this regard,\" he said. According to Hagemeister, it's more about handing down right-wing tendencies from generation to generation. \"There is research showing, for example, that children mostly tend to take on attitudes similar to those of their parents,\" he said.\nIn eastern Germany, this connection between regions in which the NSDAP was strongly supported in the past and the AfD\u00a0today is particularly clear. But it also exists in Rhineland-Palatinate, a state in Germany's west.\nHowever, it's important to exercise caution and not directly compare the voters of today with those alive almost a century ago, wrote\u00a0Christian Booss\u00a0for the\u00a0Federal Agency for Civic Education (bpb).\nHe pointed out that an analysis from 2024 showed\u00a0that the AfD's popularity is also partly determined by socioeconomic differences \u2014 that is,how people\u00a0in certain regions live, and how this leads to\u00a0cultural and ideological differences.\nThis article was originally written in German.\nWhile you're here: Every Tuesday, DW editors round up what is happening in German politics and society.

Despite its stance against multiculturalism, the party has found some success among voters with immigrant backgrounds, such as Ismet Var and Anna Nguyen, who support AfD's focus on economic issues and crime. Recent studies indicate that voting patterns among immigrant voters are becoming similar to those without immigrant backgrounds. The AfD is actively expanding its appeal to these communities, particularly those of Turkish and Russian descent, as part of a broader strategy to increase its voter base in Germany.",
            "content": "The AfD is actively courting voters with an immigrant background while at the same time stirring up anti-immigrant sentiment. Why would any voters with an immigrant background support Germany's far-right party?\nThe Alternative for Germany (AfD) sets out its views on immigrants clearly in its program: \"The AfD views the ideology of multiculturalism as a serious threat to social peace and to the continued existence of the nation as a cultural entity.\"\nAnd yet multiculturalism doesn't appear to be a serious threat to the AfD itself: In the past few months, more and more of the far-right's messaging has been aimed at voters from Germany's many immigrant communities \u2014 with some success.\nBorn in Turkey,\u00a055-year-old Ismet Var has lived in Germany since his childhood, been a German citizen since 1994, and a supporter of the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) since it was founded in 2013.\nVar works as a delivery driver in the German capital, and his work was directly hit by the rise in fuel prices following Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022. Now he can't understand why so much money is being \"thrown away\" on economic and military aid for Ukraine. His main concerns, he says, are that taxes are lowered and criminal immigrants get deported.\nThe latter is already happening \u2014 latest statistics show that Chancellor Olaf Scholz's center-left government increased deportations in the last year. \"Now! Now they're deporting people!\" says Var over a coffee in the international Kreuzberg district of Berlin. \"But they didn't used to.\" He believes that it took the AfD's intervention in the German political scene for the government to act.\nAs an Alevite, he also feels that Germany has become too tolerant of what he calls \"strict Muslims.\" \"I've got nothing against them when they pray at home, but when they do propaganda, then I'm against them,\" he said.\nVar experienced racism as a new arrival in Germany in the 1970s: He remembers a janitor in his building telling him that he and his family wouldn't be there if Hitler were still in power: \"But it didn't bother me. I was little,\" he says.\nAnna Nguyen has also experienced plenty of racism in Germany. Born near Kassel in 1990 to Vietnamese refugees, she is now an AfD representative in the Hesse state parliament. But, she insists, it isn't Germans who are racist towards her \u2014 it is mainly people she thinks are Arabs.\n\"During COVID, it was always people with an immigrant background, presumably Arabs, who shouted 'corona, corona' after me and my Chinese friend,\" she said. \"It's true that on the internet I get flooded with racist comments \u2014 but from the left, even though they call themselves anti-racists.\"\nNguyen insists that her party, meanwhile, is indifferent to race and is not strategically seeking out voters like her. \"It's not about immigrant background,\" she says. \"It's about the fact that all the sensible people in this country want to prevent this green ideological madness. It's about: Can I afford a good life? Is it safe? Do we have a safe electricity supply?\"\nVoters with an\u00a0immigrant background are a demographic reality in Germany: Official statistics from 2023 show that some 12% of the German electorate have a non-German background \u2014 some 7.1 million people. As recently as 2016, some 40% of voters of migrant background voted for the center-left Social Democrats (SPD), and another 28% for the center-right Christian Democratic Union (CDU). But those loyalties appear to have eroded.\nAccording to the German Center for Integration and Migration Research (DeZIM), which is releasing a study on voting habits among migrants at the end of January, there is little difference between voting behavior with or without an immigration background. As late as the general election in 2017, 35% of German Turks voted for the SPD, while 0% voted for the AfD. Now, according DeZIM, immigrant voters don't vote for the AfD any more or less than non-migrant Germans do.\nDeZIM's Jannes Jacobsen, who co-authored the upcoming report, said the AfD appears to be becoming more attractive for people from different backgrounds. He also pointed out that these voters are German citizens \u2014 and see themselves as German. \"So it's maybe not such a big surprise that these people don't vote very differently to people who have no immigrant history,\" he told DW.\nIn 2023, Robert Lambrou, also an AfD state parliamentarian in Hesse, founded an organization named \"With Migration Background for Germany\" for immigrant AfD supporters. The organization's website says it has 137 members from over 30 countries, and that it is open to anyone \"who professes their belief in German culture as the dominant culture and work for the continued existence of the nation as a cultural entity.\"\n\"My experience of the AfD is that it makes no difference whether one is of immigrant background or not,\" the 55-year-old Lambrou, whose father was Greek, told DW. \"I don't see the party as xenophobic \u2014 we want a sensible migration policy.\"\nBut that is hard to square with statements like that of AfD Bundestag member Ren\u00e9 Springer, who, in the wake of revelations early last year that AfD politicians were part of a meeting planning mass \"remigration\" of immigrants and non-white Germans, who wrote on X: \"We will send foreigners back to their home countries. By the million. That isn't a secret plan. That is a promise.\"\nLambrou agreed that some statements are not helpful if they are not properly founded in facts or express important nuances. \"When we notice statements by party members that we don't think are ok, then we try to seek out internal party dialogue,\" he said.\nTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video\nNevertheless, there do appear to be more and more pro-AfD TikTok videos made by non-white people in the past few months.\n\u00d6zg\u00fcr \u00d6zvatan, CEO of the political consultancy Transformakers, and author of an upcoming book on the political impact of Germans of immigration background, said that the AfD has been actively seeking out the attention of immigrant voters for at least the last year \u2014 particularly people with Russian and Turkish roots \u2014 mainly because those communities are more likely to have voting rights. According to Germany's official statistics, there are over 2.9 million people of Turkish background in Germany, of whom nearly 1.6 million have German citizenship. The post-Soviet diaspora, meanwhile, also runs into the millions, and includes several nationalities and ethnicities \u2014 including German. Many of these are also likely to feel attracted to the AfD's pro-Russia\u00a0stance on the Ukraine war.\n\u00d6zvatan argues that this all part of the AfD's larger strategy to expand its voter base. \"Its potential voters in the non-immigrant landscape are of course finite,\" he said. \"They might have a potential vote-share of around 20-25% there \u2014 but if they want to get towards 30-35%, then they need to expand their portfolio, and that will mean creating content and promise policies for immigrant communities.\"\n\"People who immigrated earlier are not automatically in favor of immigration,\" \u00d6zvatan told DW. \"They can be immigrants and hold anti-immigration positions.\"\nNguyen insists that immigrant voters aren't deterred by the racism and contradictions \"because they know who is meant by that \u2014 that's the illegal immigrants, especially those since 2015. It's those that are criminal \u2014 and people of immigration background suffer just as much from those as anyone.\"\n\u00d6zvatan thinks many immigrant voters simply aren't aware of the racist statements, and even when they do hear\u00a0overt racism, they quickly dismiss it as secondary to their main perception of the AfD \u2014 that they don't mean them. \"The main feeling is,\u00a0'they are friendly towards us,'\" he said,\u00a0\"And the AfD tries to engender that feeling.\"\nEdited by Rina Goldenberg\nWhile you're here: Every Tuesday, DW editors round up what is happening in German politics and society.

Leader Alice Weidel embraced the controversial term \"remigration,\" which critics link to mass deportations. The party is polling around 20% nationally and has made regional gains, despite being labeled extremist by domestic intelligence. Weidel's recent comments and associations have sparked concerns over Nazi revisionism. The AfD's anti-establishment and anti-immigration stance is resonating with voters ahead of the upcoming federal election on February 23.",
            "content": "Germany's far right is in a buoyant mood.\nOn Saturday, while its conference was under way in the eastern town of Riesa, in Saxony, Alternative f\u00fcr Deutschland (AfD) laid out ambitions to close Germany's borders, resume buying Russian gas and, in effect, dismantle the EU.\nGerman media reported that party's agreed manifesto includes plans to quit the Paris climate deal, exit the Euro currency and create a new confederation of states.\nThe AfD's leader, Alice Weidel, even publicly embraced the term \"remigration\" - a word that's widely understood to mean the mass \"return\" or deportation of people with a migrant background.\nThousands of anti-AfD protestors swarmed the streets in Riesa on Saturday, seeking to obstruct access to the conference venue.\nWhen Alice Weidel eventually took to the stage, she described the activists outside as a \"left-wing mob.\"\nAnd, in front a delighted conference hall of delegates, spoke of \"large-scale repatriations\".\n\"And I have to be honest with you: if it's going to be called remigration, then that's what it's going to be: remigration,\" she said.\nIt's a striking departure from just a year ago when she sought to distance herself from a scandal that centred on the highly controversial concept.\nThere were nationwide anti-AfD demonstrations after it emerged that senior party figures had been among those at a meeting where \"remigration\" was allegedly discussed with Martin Sellner, an Austrian far-right activist who has a neo-Nazi past.\nSellner has written about \"remigrating\" asylum seekers, some foreigners with residency rights and \"non-assimilated\" citizens.\nA buzzword in Europe's far-right, some claim legal residents wouldn't be forced to leave. Critics say \"remigration\" is simply a euphemism for an overtly racist mass deportation plan.\nBut Alice Weidel's decision to personally coin the term, weeks out from a snap federal election, demonstrates her party's growing radicalism and confidence.\nShe also pledged to tear down wind farms which she called \"windmills of shame\", leave the EU's asylum system and \"throw out\" gender studies professors.\nThe AfD is consistently polling second in Germany and made gains in recent regional elections in the country's east \u2013 where the party is strongest.\nHowever, it's highly unlikely to win power because other parties won't work with the AfD.\nSections of the AfD have been classed by domestic intelligence as right-wing extremist.\nIn 2024, a talisman of the AfD's hard-right \u2013 Bj\u00f6rn H\u00f6cke \u2013 was fined twice for using a banned Nazi SA paramilitary phrase, \"Alles f\u00fcr Deutschland\" (\"everything for Germany\").\nHe's called it an \"everyday sentence\" and denied being aware of its origins, despite formerly being a history teacher.\nReports that members of the conference in Riesa this weekend chanted \"Alice f\u00fcr Deutschland\" drew quick comparisons in German media.\nHowever, AfD figures have frequently complained that they are demonised and persecuted by a biased media and establishment.\nAnd Alice Weidel's party \u2013 of which she is the co-leader and now Chancellor candidate \u2013 has ridden out repeated storms to now hover around or even above 20% in national polls.\nThe 45-year-old economist, who previously worked for Goldman Sachs and is in a same-sex relationship, has sought to polish the rougher edges of her party.\nBut for those strongly opposed to the AfD she is a fig leaf or - as one Social Democrat put it - a \"wolf in sheep's clothing\".\nRegardless, she's enjoying a new spotlight after being invited by tech billionaire \u2013 Elon Musk \u2013 for a live talk on his X platform last week, where he wholeheartedly endorsed the party.\nHer declaration during this discussion that Adolf Hitler was, in fact, a communist  sparked condemnation, given the Nazi leader's well-known anti-communism.\nCritics warned of Nazi revisionism - something the AfD has been accused of before.\nBj\u00f6rn H\u00f6cke once called for a \"180-degree turnaround\" in Germany's handling of its Nazi past while a former co-leader, Alexander Gauland, described the Nazi era as \"just a speck of bird's muck in more than 1,000 years of successful Germany history\".\nNevertheless, the AfD's anti-establishment, anti-immigration and anti-\"woke\" agenda is finding followers in Germany who go to the polls on 23 February.\nIt is 80 years since Soviet Union troops liberated Auschwitz - now marked as Holocaust Memorial Day.\nRocket Factory Augsburg (RFA) have been awarded a licence allowing them to launch rockets from Shetland.\nThe number of sightings has increased since Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine, officials say.\nThe disease is contagious in livestock like cattle, but poses no risk to humans or food safety.\nTaghavi, 70, spent more than four years in jail after a trial that rights groups said was grossly unfair.\nCopyright 2025 BBC.

Will it survive another year in the doldrums?\nGoing into 2025, the German economy remains stuck in recession, with a\u00a0crisis\u00a0in the country's all-important automotive industry significantly contributing to the downturn.\nEurope's biggest carmaker, Volkswagen (VW), for instance, is planning to cut thousands of jobs in Germany\u00a0over the next few years.Mass layoffs are also on the horizon at other German automakers, affecting many of the industry's multiple suppliers.\nThe current state of affairs in the German car industry is plain to see for everyone, but opinions diverge when it comes to identifying the causes of the crisis.\nIndustry expert Stefan Bratzel from the Center of Automotive Management describes the situation as a \"combination of difficulties,\" calling\u00a0the problems a \"German polycrisis.\"\nHe told DW that the industry is \"still learning new skills in the transformation toward e-mobility, software-based vehicles\u00a0and autonomous driving.\" Additionally, Bratzel said\u00a0a \"new competitive environment\" has emerged in the industry, with challenges\u00a0\"not limited to [US electric-vehicle pioneer] Tesla and new Chinese manufacturers.\"\nA spokesperson for the German Association of the Automotive Industry (VDA) laid part of the blame for the difficulties on\u00a0policymakers, telling DW that the sudden termination of electric-vehicle (EV) subsidies in December 2023 by the government of Chancellor Olaf Scholz\u00a0and an insufficient charging infrastructure in Germany were \"dampening sales figures and contributed to the overall situation.\"\nFerdinand Dudenh\u00f6ffer from the Center for Automotive Research\u00a0think tank shares this view, criticizing politicians for sending conflicting signals.\u00a0\"One moment, they want electric cars, and the next, they're promoting combustion engines, which confuses people,\" he told DW.\nFor quite a few years now, it has been clear that the future of the automobile\u00a0lies outside the traditional internal combustion engine, no matter whether fueled by fossil fuels or synthetic alternatives. The trend in the industry is moving decisively toward electrically driven cars.\nFrank Schwope, who teaches automotive economics at the University of Applied Sciences for Small and Medium Enterprises in Germany, sees \"serious management errors at some manufacturers.\" He said executives have buried their heads in the sand, hoping \"everything would work out fine.\"\nBut it hasn't, said Bratzel, and\u00a0the German car industry has fallen behind in the global competition \"due to high labor costs, including health care expenses and extensive vacation days.\" These privileges for German workforces \"worked as long as Germany was better and more innovative than others,\" he said.\nTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video\nBratzel has identified a critical shortfall: While German automakers excel in building conventional cars, they lag behind in making\u00a0EVs, as these\u00a0require automotive software and electronic components rather than mechanical parts.\n\"The erosion of old paradigms and knowledge is truly tragic,\" he said.\nDirk Dohse from the Kiel Institute for the World Economy (IfW)\u00a0believes German developers and engineers are \"still among the global elite.\" Nevertheless, he told DW, there is a \"lack of flexibility, particularly in management, to attract new customer groups, such as tech-savvy young people in Asia.\"\nDohse sees China clearly leading Germany not only in EV technology but also with regard to market power. \"The Chinese EV market is the largest and most dynamic globally, which suggests China will continue to pull ahead,\" he said.\nChina's huge technological advances and a dramatic shift in Chinese customer\u00a0preferences have created massive problems for Germany's big three automakers VW, BMW and Mercedes, who had long dominated the Chinese car market with their combustion engine vehicles.\nBut there are even new rivals competing against the Germans for market share, said Bratzel.\n\"It's not just China. In the medium term, stronger players will also emerge in India, modeled after Chinese manufacturers. Many companies from China and Korea are likely to enter India, possibly through joint ventures,\" he said.\nFor Frank Schwope, German automakers can still see some hope in the development of state-of-the-art batteries, a key component of EVs at the moment and in the future.\n\"Batteries for electric vehicles are far from mature. Significant advances are possible, and by the end of the decade, we could see a shift toward solid-state batteries, which could change the game,\" he said.\nStefan Bratzel believes 2025 will be a decisive year for the German auto industry's efforts to catch up with global developments \u2014 not only in terms of\u00a0regulatory improvements but also in terms of creative and courageous action on the part of management. \"Germany must be at least as innovative as it is expensive,\" he said.\nWhat's at stake wasvividly illustrated by a recent study conducted by the Swiss-based Prognos Institute on behalf of the VDA industry group. If the current EV trend continues, the study said, about 186,000 fewer carmaking jobs will exist in Germany by 2035 compared to 2019.\nBetween 2019 and 2023, the industry already lost some 46,000 jobs, the VDA spokesperson quoted from the study, with \"another 140,000 likely to disappear by 2035.\"\nAs a result, said the spokesperson, VDA is calling for swift political action that must include \"less bureaucracy, more trade agreements, a competitive tax system, as well as simpler and faster approval processes.\"\nEven if policymakers create more favorable conditions and German carmakers regain\u00a0competitiveness, the industry's recovery will take time, cautioned\u00a0Bratzel.\n\"The next two to three years will be a major challenge, requiring the simultaneous tackling of many structural problems,\" he said, adding on a brighter note: \"At least politics has now recognized Germany's 'polycrisis.'\"\nIfW's Dohse, by contrast, predicts the situation may worsen before improving. \"I think 2025 will be a very tough year for the German auto industry, and it will also be a year when setting the right course for the future will be essential,\" he said.\nFor Dudenh\u00f6ffer, much will depend on how markets in the United States and China develop. \"It's of utmost importance for the industry to be present in dynamic markets. This can be China to some degree, but also the US, where Donald Trump has yet to decide, however, if he wants to go back to the 1980s era of the combustion engine,\" he said of the US president-elect.\nSchwope thinks there's a glimmer of hope for German carmakers, as he expects currently sluggish EV sales in Germany and Europe to \"gain significant momentum by 2025, or in 2026 at the latest.\"\nThis article was originally written in German.",

Germany is increasing skilled worker visas and promoting its labor needs, while the Netherlands acknowledges the importance of foreign workers for economic competitiveness. Governments are balancing public anti-immigration stances with the necessity of attracting skilled labor.",
            "content": "As aging populations exacerbate worker shortages, European countries are quietly luring skilled foreign workers \u2014 even as pressure from the far right to keep immigration down has increased.\nWith\u00a0immigration\u00a0the top political issue in Europe, particularly with the surge of the far right, pressure on governments to keep the numbers down has increased.\nAnd yet several countries, even those with a publicly anti-immigrant stance, are luring foreign workers to fill a large labor void and keep the\u00a0economies in an aging continent running.\nThe European Union\u00a0has identified\u00a042 occupations that face labor shortages and has come up with an action plan to attract foreign workers.\u00a0Nearly two-thirds of small and medium-sized businesses in the bloc say they cannot find the talent they need.\nOn the face of it, many European leaders, especially those on the far right, have advocated deals with third countries to curb the entry of immigrants or repatriate them elsewhere. And yet, amid\u00a0much less fanfare, signs of a policy shift acknowledging the need for immigrants have come to light.\nItaly's far-right government, led by Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni, has decided to recruit hundreds of thousands of foreign workers desperately needed to plug the gaping shortages.\n\"For the three-year period [from] 2023-2025, the government expects a total of 452,000 entries,'' the Italian government said last year, also admitting it is much less than the \"detected need of 833,000'' workers over that period of time.\nAccording to the IDOS Study and Research Center, Italy needs\u00a0280,000 foreign workers annually until 2050 to meet the labor shortfall in various sectors such as agriculture, tourism and health care \u2014\u00a0about half the number of asylum applications filed last year. The country faces labor shortages in 37 occupations, with nurses and other health care professionals in the most demand.\nThe government recently\u00a0announced it will recruit 10,000 nurses from India to help make up a shortage that is three times that much. Italian Health Minister Orazio Schillaci said in October that India has\u00a0an oversupply of\u00a0nurses.\u00a0\"There are 3.3 million nurses\" in India, he said. \"We want to bring here about 10,000.\"\nTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video\nSchillaci\u00a0said the Indian nurses are professionally capable and will be recruited directly by Italian regions and placed wherever needed, once their ability to speak in Italian has been determined.\nMaurizio Ambrosini, a professor of sociology and a migration expert at the University of Milan, told DW that Meloni's\u00a0government has been compelled to change policy by employers who are in desperate need of workers.\n\"Italian employers were very silent on the migration debate for years.\u00a0I suppose they didn't want a battle with the right-wing parties,'' he said over the phone. \"But no longer.\"\nMany, even in her own coalition, see the policy as a strong reversal from Meloni, who once referred to pro-immigration policies as part of a left-wing conspiracy to \u201creplace Italians with immigrants.\"\n\"I hoped now that we finally have a right-wing government the situation would change, but the right is getting worse than the left,'' said Attilio Lucia, a member of the far-right League party and the deputy mayor of Lampedusa, a tiny island that is the arriving port for many migrants.\nBusinesses may have also affected the thinking in the new Dutch\u00a0government led by far-right lawmaker Geert Wilders' Freedom Party.\nASML, the country's largest company that manufactures semiconductor equipment, has said its success depends on talented people, wherever they come from. The company has\u00a0suggested that inbound migration must not be restricted. Nearly 40% of the company's employees are foreign workers.\n\"We have built our company with more than 100 nationalities,\" Christophe Fouquet, ASML's CEO, \u00a0said at the Bloomberg Tech Summit in London last month. \"Bringing talent from everywhere has been an absolute condition for success, and this has to continue.\"\nTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video\nThe Netherlands has sought an exemption or an \"opt-out'' from\u00a0the EU asylum system, which treats asylum as \"a fundamental right and an international obligation for countries.\"\u00a0Media reports have suggested that high anti-immigrant rhetoric perpetuated by the far right has made skilled workers feel less welcome in the country.\nBut even the far-right political groups must grapple with the reality of just how much the companies\u00a0need foreign workers to stay competitive.\nThe Netherlands has only marginally reduced the tax incentive for foreign workers \u2014\u00a0from 30%\u00a0to just 27%. This tax break has been among the most attractive features for talented youth to move to the country, or \"knowledge migrants\" as the government calls them.\n\"This is a relatively small change in the total net income of highly skilled foreign workers,\"\u00a0said Lisa Timm, a researcher on\u00a0migration at the University of Amsterdam,\u00a0\"I think it will have a negligible effect on migrant arrivals.\"\nGermany is on course to issue 200,000 visas to skilled workers this year, a 10% increase from 2023. This is due to an \"Opportunity Card\"\u00a0scheme,\u00a0residence permits that allow\u00a0workers from countries outside the EU to come to Germany and seek employment, introduced in June.\nOn a recent visit to India, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz said Germany is \"open for skilled workers\"\u00a0and agreed to smooth out bureaucratic hurdles and increase visas for Indians from 20,000 to 90,000 annually.\nGermany needs around 400,000 new skilled employees a year to cover worker shortages, especially in the fields of engineering, IT and health care, and sees a potential workforce in trained Indians.\nOn the other hand, the rise of the far-right, anti-immigrant\u00a0Alternative for Germany (AfD) in regional elections and a knife attack in the western German town of Solingen over the summer compelled\u00a0Scholz\u00a0to sign off on internal border checks in the EU \"to curb migration.\"\nSpeaking on the issue in July, Scholz\u00a0said irregular migration to Germany\u00a0must \"come down\" but also stressed\u00a0the country's need for skilled foreigners.\nNearly all European countries face the same problem \u2014\u00a0labor shortages in an aging population. Despite an influx of immigrants, they don't want to appear to be allowing for migrant arrivals without\u00a0visas.\nAmbrosini, the University of Milan professor,\u00a0said European countries are\u00a0having\u00a0trouble reconciling\u00a0two different immigration policies, one for public consumption that calls for \"border enforcement agreements with transit countries like Tunisia, or deportation to external facilities like Italy's Albania agreement.\n\"On the other hand, it is becoming clearer that they need workers, and they are coming up with new policies to attract a workforce that is not only skilled but also seasonal workers,\" he said. \"This second policy is kept a bit hidden, not too much publicized, and can be visible only to the employer associations.\"\nIn the end, it's about the governments being able to say they are in control of who is coming in and who gets to stay,\u00a0said Ambrosini.\u00a0But that's a myth, at least regarding blue-collar jobs, since employers receive references from those already in Europe for whom to hire.\n\"How will the employer know who to get from Peru, for instance?\"\nEdited by: Davis VanOpdorp",

The worst-ranked countries are major oil producers like Iran and Russia. Despite progress in renewables, the EU and Germany received medium ratings due to insufficient climate policies. China is experiencing a renewables boom, but its reliance on coal remains a concern for future emissions reductions.",
            "content": "The world is at a turning point, as CO2 emissions could soon stop rising thanks to a renewable energy boom. But according to a new climate protection ranking, countries aren't doing enough to move away from oil and gas.\nRenewable energies are expanding rapidly in high-emissions countries, but too many states are prolonging the use of fossil fuels, particularly gas, according to the latest Climate Change Performance Index, which ranks states' climate protection measures.\n\"The world is at a turning point. Peak of global emissions is closely in sight,\" said Niklas H\u00f6hne of German climate policy think tank NewClimate Institute,\u00a0and a co-author of the report. But states\u00a0need\u00a0to act quickly to drastically cut emissions and \"prevent further dangerous consequences of climate change,\" he added.\nThe CCPI, published annually, evaluated the 63 countries plus the European Union that are responsible for 90% of global greenhouse gas emissions.\nOf the countries analyzed, 61 have managed to increase the share of green energy sources, like wind and solar, in their energy mixes over the last five years.\n\"Renewables are in the fast lane, especially in the electricity sector,\" said lead author Jan Burck from environment NGO Germanwatch, on the launch of the CCPI during the UN climate summit in Azerbaijan. \"In addition, there is an increasing electrification of the mobility, residential and industrial sectors. The trend toward\u00a0electrification is continuing.\"\nStill, 42 countries' current per capita emissions are not aligned with the Paris goal of limiting global average temperature rise to 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 Fahrenheit).\nThe CCPI, said H\u00f6hne, shows \"how big the resistance from the fossil fuel lobby is.\"\nIn the US presidential election, this was \"a decisive factor in bringing [Donald] Trump back to the White House,\" said H\u00f6hne. The US has experienced a boom in shale gas over the past few years and Trump has promised to further expand domestic fossil fuel production and spend less on clean energy.\nThe countries that ranked worst in the CCPI \u2014 Iran, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and Russia \u2014 are also among the largest oil and gas producers in the world. The share of renewables in their respective energy mixes is under 3%, the analysis found, with the countries showing \"no signs of departing from fossil fuels as a business model.\"\nThe CCPI, put together by experts from Germanwatch, NewClimate Institute and international environment grouping Climate Action Network, ranks countries' progress in cutting carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions and energy use\u00a0as well as expanding renewables and improving climate policy.\nThe top three spots in the ranking remained unclaimed \u2014 as is usually the case \u2014 because none of the countries surveyed are doing enough to \"avoid dangerous climate change\" and achieve a \"very high\" rating.\nDenmark once again clinched the number 4 spot, followed by the Netherlands and the United Kingdom, one of the countries with the biggest ranking improvement this year.\nThe UK moved up 14 positions from 2023 due the recent closure of the country's last coal power plant. The new Labour government has also\u00a0pledged not to issue any new licenses for fossil fuel projects, making\u00a0the country a pioneer among industrialized G7 nations.\nThe CCPI also gave Norway, Sweden, Luxembourg, Estonia and Portugal a \"high\" rating, alongside the Philippines, Morocco, Chile and the world's most populous country, India.\nThe European Union slipped one spot down the ranking to 17th place and scored\u00a0a \"medium\" rating for its overall climate performance.\nWhile the authors described the bloc's climate protection\u00a0\u2014\u00a0based on\u00a0the EU Green Deal\u2014 as major progress, they said measures it had taken so far didn't amount to a fair share of\u00a0global greenhouse gas emissions cuts. The authors called on the bloc to stop financing fossil fuels and fulfill pledges to phase out oil and gas subsidies by 2025.\nGermany, the EU's largest economy, also slipped two places to 16th and was given a \"medium\" rating. \"Although considerable progress has been made in renewables, the political inaction in the transport and building sectors still leads to high emissions,\" said co-author Thea Uhlich from Germanwatch.\nBoth sectors have consistently missed their emissions reductions targets, and German environmental NGO BUND has said it is taking legal action over the country's main climate legislation, calling it insufficient.\nThe authors gave nine other EU countries, as well as Egypt, Nigeria, Brazil, Colombia, Vietnam, Thailand and Pakistan, a \"medium\" rating.\nChina and the US are the\u00a0world's biggest polluters of greenhouse gas CO2 and were rated \"very low\" for climate performance.\nIn the US, the landmark Inflation Reduction Act, a climate bill signed by outgoing President Joe Biden, has been positive for expanding renewables, said the authors. But \"per capita emissions are still very high at 15.8 tons of CO2 equivalent per year,\" added\u00a0H\u00f6hne.\nSome fear a Trump presidency will set back climate action, and while Trump's election is \"certainly not good news\" for the climate, said H\u00f6hne, \"it remains to be seen\" how much legislation\u00a0the new administration can roll back.\n\"Even Trump can't stop the boom in renewable energy,\" he said.\nTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video\nAs for China, the nation is experiencing an \"unprecedented\" renewables boom, pointed out Burck from Germanwatch.\n\"Emissions appear to have almost peaked. That would be a real milestone and an important driver worldwide,\" he said. In the first quarter of 2024, CO2 emissions fell in China without an accompanying economic downturn. This is significant as emissions otherwise usually fall when a country is in recession.\n\"But to reduce the country's immense emissions quickly and sustainably, we now need a clear move away from fossil fuels,\" Burck said.\nThere is currently no indication the country is moving in that direction;\u00a0China is still building a lot of coal plants. But things could change with the\u00a0pending new five-year plan.\n\"This is a huge opportunity for China to gain international recognition \u2014 especially in contrast to the future US government,\" he said.\nThis article was originally written in German.",

Since 2014, emissions from electricity generation have halved. Despite political debates, there is a consensus on the need for an energy transition. However, the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) opposes decarbonization efforts, posing challenges ahead of February elections. While emissions fell by 3% last year, Germany remains one of the top global emitters. Analysts emphasize the country's historical responsibility and the need to continue innovating in clean technologies.",
            "content": "Countries around the world are working to reduce their emissions of planet-heating carbon dioxide. Germany is now responsible for less than 2%, but even that is too much.\nGermany's 2024 electricity generation was its \"cleanest ever,\"\u00a0with renewable energy accounting for 62.7% of the mix, according to new research.\nThis shift, which is thanks to an uptick in green energy and decline in coal-based power, is part of a longer trend that has seen Germany halve its emissions from electricity generation since 2014.\nReductions have been achieved across many sectors despite differing political perspectives on how to make energy greener, according to Andreas L\u00f6schel, an environmental economist at Ruhr University Bochum.\n\"There was never a questioning of the general theme of the energy transition. That was supported by all parties over three decades now, which I think is quite unique and it reflects the general dedication of the German population,\"\u00a0said L\u00f6schel, who is also chairman of the expert commission on monitoring the government's energy transition.\nAs Germany prepares for snap elections in February, however, that is changing. Second in the polls, the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) says it would end efforts towards decarbonization and plans for carbon neutrality within the next two decades.\nWith the country's established parties currently refusing to consider forming a coalition government with the AfD, it is unlikely that the party will make it into power.\nNevertheless, Germany's reduction of planet-heating greenhouse gas emissions stagnated somewhat last year. Though they fell by 3% to reach a historic low, the decline was considerably slower than the 10% drop of 2023.\nIn 2022, Germany was responsible for around 1.75% of global carbon dioxide emissions. By comparison, the world's biggest emitter, China, accounted for just under a third of CO2 spewed into the atmosphere in the same year. Roughly another third was made up of countries producing more than 2%, like the United States, which was responsible for around 13%.\n\"The final third is completely made-up of countries that have less than 2% of the world's emissions,\"\u00a0said Hannah Ritchie, deputy editor and lead researcher at the Oxford University-affiliated scientific platform Our World in Data. \"All of the small emitters combined add up to more than China emits.\"\nShe said that is one of the reasons why even relatively low-emitting industrialized countries like Germany\u00a0need to continue working to decarbonize: \"Even at a fundamental mathematics level, this doesn't work if we don't take action.\"\nAnd despite the progress Germany has made thus far, it remains among the 10 biggest emitters globally. Home to just over 1% of the world's population, Germany's residents emitted an average of around 7.1 tons per person in 2023, well over the world average of 4.7 tons.\nTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video\nAnalysts also argue that being one of the first countries to industrialize, Germany has a duty to clean up its act. At its peak in the late 1800s, the country was responsible for around 17% of global carbon emissions.\n\"Our historical emissions are much larger than our emissions today. That has brought us much higher standards of living,\" said Ritchie.\nAnd because CO2 can remain in the atmosphere for between 300 and 1,000 years, emissions from the industrialization of countries such as Germany, Britain and France are still warming the planet today, impacting lives in distant places.\nWorld Weather Attribution (WWA), an international organization that tracks the link between global warming and extreme weather, found that climate change had contributed to 26 events they studied in 2024. These were connected to the deaths of at least 3,700 people and the displacement of millions more.\nExtreme weather events studied by the organization included heatwaves in Asia and Europe, extreme rainfall in India, Afghanistan, Iran, Pakistan and Spain, drought in South America and Italy,\u00a0wildfires in Brazil and Chile, and storms in the United States and the Philippines, among others.\nCountries in the Global South, those that have not yet industrialized by burning fossil fuels and so are least responsible for the climate crisis, are being the hardest hit by extreme weather events.\n\"We have contributed to this problem of global climate change,\" Ritchie said. \"Therefore, there is a moral responsibility lens there by which we should try to use our wealth and our high standards of living to reduce our emissions.\"\nIn the early 2000s, Germany used its wealth to pioneer what was then a new technology to drive down emissions, using government subsidies to incentivize an uptake in solar power.\n\"Without German policies on renewables, we would not have seen solar technology being used worldwide and being a big success factor, a development factor, for many countries in the world,\" L\u00f6schel\u00a0told DW.\nAdding that Europe's largest economy should also continue to focus on cutting its emissions to promote innovation in clean technologies elsewhere.\n\"We have to show that it's possible to have an industrialized country that is able to keep up with the climate challenges and develop technologies, develop system solutions that demonstrate that this is not going to be a reason for economic decline, for loss of competitiveness,\" he said.\nUnder current national legislation, Germany is obliged to reduce its emissions by 65% from 1990 levels by 2030. As well as helping the country meet its climate targets, David Ryfisch, head of future-proof finance at environment and rights NGO Germanwatch, said a forward-looking approach will also serve other national interests.\n\"We see that renewable energy, especially wind and solar, we see that batteries, electrolyzers, etc., they're all following the same paths of technology that have been successful in history, so it's very likely that these technologies will succeed,\" he said.\n\"It is in Germany's interest to invest in the\u00a0technologies necessary for the transformation and become global leaders in this to have a competitive edge.\"\nEdited by: Tamsin Walker",

While renewable sources provided 125% of demand at times, winter months revealed a reliance on coal and gas. In 2024, imports from France, which relies on nuclear power, were significant. The Federal Cartel Office is investigating potential price manipulation by energy companies. Industrial electricity costs remain high, prompting political calls, especially from the CDU/CSU, to reduce grid fees and taxes. The transition to renewable energy is costly, necessitating extensive infrastructure investments before financial benefits materialize.",
            "content": "Electricity is more expensive in Germany than anywhere else in Europe. This burdens consumers, especially the sluggish economy. Politicians are looking for solutions. What options do they have?\nThe new year was ushered in with stormy weather. Wind turbines were operating at top speed and in many places, the sun was shining. As a result, electricity production from renewable energies in Germany accounted for 125% of demand, according to the Fraunhofer Institute for Solar Energy Systems.\nThe oversupply drove down the price of electricity on the exchanges, where prices are determined by supply and demand, and for a few hours, electricity was even available for free.\nIn 2024, an average of 59% of Germany's electricity was generated from renewable sources. But during the winter darkness, this output is far from adequate. December 12, 2024, marked a low point, when only 18% of Germany's electricity needs were met by renewables. The rest had to be generated by coal- and gas-fired power plants, and electricity imports from neighboring EU countries.\nTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video\nThe EU has a common electricity market. This means that during periods of high wind and sunshine, Germany is able to export energy, while during periods of low wind and sunshine, it increasingly has to import energy. Most of the electricity that Germany purchased in 2024 came from France, which meets 70% of its energy needs with nuclear power that is available throughout the year.\nImports and exports are based on the current prices on the European Energy Exchange. In addition, consumers have to pay the national taxes and levies. In Germany, around 30% of the electricity price is made up of grid charges. This refers to the cost of expanding the power grid. Taxes and levies make up about another third.\nHouseholds and companies have barely even noticed the price fluctuations because they often have long-term electricity contracts. They pay their electricity supplier a fixed price for a specified period of time, as agreed in a contract.\nHowever, since the beginning of 2025, suppliers have also had to offer dynamic rates at current prices. In this way, customers who use large amounts of electricity, for example, to charge electric cars or run heat pumps, have had a financial incentive to schedule their energy consumption for times supply is high and thus prices are low.\nTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video\nIn 2024, electricity generation from brown coal continued to decline by a good 8% in Germany, while black coal declined by more than 27%. Since 2015, the percentage of electricity generated from coal has fallen by almost half, significantly reducing CO2 emissions.\n2024 was also the first year that Germany was able to do without producing any of its own nuclear power. The last three nuclear power plants, which were shut down in 2023, accounted for a solid 6% of electricity production.\nBut is too little wind and sun power to blame for the jump in prices? Or have energy companies perhaps been deliberately trying to drive up the price of electricity by not connecting all their coal- and gas-fired power plants to the grid in order to reduce supply? This is the question now being asked by the German Federal Cartel Office. It is part of the Federal Ministry of Economics and is responsible for ensuring fair competition in the market. If it uncovers illegal price fixing, it can impose fines.\nNowhere in Europe is electricity more expensive than in Germany. According to the Federal Statistical Office, a family of three to four had to pay just under 40 cents per kilowatt hour in 2024. In Hungary and Bulgaria, on the other hand, where electricity is subsidized by the state, consumers only had to pay 10 cents per kilowatt hour.\nGermany also has subsidies, but only for industrial companies. However, energy-intensive companies have been complaining that energy costs are still far too high for them to be competitive.\nTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video\nWhile the industry was still paying around 12 cents per kilowatt hour in 2021, the price peaked at more than 50 cents in 2022 following Russia's invasion of Ukraine. On July 1, 2022, taxes and levies were significantly reduced for companies.\nToday, industrial businesses pay\u00a0around 17 cents. However, this is significantly higher than what companies pay in other major competitor countries. In 2023, for example, companies in the German automotive industry paid over twice as much for electricity as their competitors in China and almost three times as much as comparable companies in the US. Significantly reducing electricity prices remains one of the most pressing economic imperatives.\nThe center-right bloc of Christian Democratic Union (CDU) and\u00a0Christian Social Union (CSU), with Friedrich Merz at the head of their ticket for chancellor, have stated in their election platform that they want to halve grid fees and further reduce the electricity tax for energy-intensive companies. However, it is unclear how this is to be financed.\nWhat remains clear is that the continued expansion of renewable energies, electricity grids, and storage facilities will remain costly for many years to come. Only once the infrastructure is in place will the financial benefits of wind and solar energy be felt.\nThis article was originally written in German.\nWhile you're here: Every Tuesday, DW editors round up what is happening in German politics and society.

            "content": "Markets\nHot Stocks\nFear & Greed Index\nLatest Market News\nHot Stocks\nFollow:\nElon Musk is wading into more than just American politics, throwing his support behind a far-right German political party.\nMusk, the billionaire Trump ally who is playing a public role in the incoming administration, posted in support Friday of Alternative for Germany, or AfD, after the German government collapsed this week.\n\u201cOnly the AfD can save Germany,\u201d Musk wrote Friday while re-posting a video from far-right political activist Naomi Seibt.\nThe AfD, which has recently seen its popularity swell, has touted populist and anti-immigrant \u201cGermany first\u201d positions. But the party has also been accused of resurrecting Nazi-era ideology and slogans. In May, a judge ruled that Germany\u2019s domestic intelligence agency could continue to keep the the AfD under surveillance for the alleged threat it poses to German democracy, rejecting a challenge by the party.\nIts youth arm, the Young Alternative (JA), has been designated by German authorities as a \u201cconfirmed extremist\u201d organization. The party\u2019s lead candidate in the eastern German state of Thuringia, Bj\u00f6rn H\u00f6cke, was convicted earlier this year after breaking German laws against uttering Nazi slogans in public.\nRelated article\nElon Musk flexes his political muscle, sending government on path to shutdown\nBut the party has seen growing support. AfD recently became the first far-right party to win a state election in Germany since the Nazi era, though all of the country\u2019s mainstream political parties have said they will not sit with them in a coalition, which will be necessary to form enough seats for a ruling government.\nIt\u2019s not the first time Musk has waded into German politics. In June, he responded to a video of Seibt\u2019s asking \u201cWhy is there such a negative reaction from some about AfD? They keep saying \u2018far right,\u2019 but the policies of AfD that I\u2019ve read about don\u2019t sound extremist. Maybe I\u2019m missing something,\u201d he wrote. And last month he labeled German Chancellor Olaf Scholz a \u201cfool\u201d after his governing coalition collapsed.\nOn Friday, Musk continued posting about the AfD, writing in response to a user\u2019s post about the party\u2019s immigration policy that it \u201csounds reasonable.\u201d\nMusk began following AfD leader Alice Weidel on X who responded to his endorsement, posting a video expressing gratitude.\n\u201cAlternative for Germany is indeed the one and only alternative for our country; our very last option. I wish you and President Donald Trump all the best for the upcoming tenure!\u201d she wrote.\nChristian Lindner, the leader of Germany\u2019s pro-business Free Democratic Party, also responded to Musk\u2019s post Friday urging him not to \u201crush to conclusions from afar.\u201d\n\u201cWhile migration control is crucial for Germany, the AfD stands against freedom, business \u2013 and it\u2019s a far-right extremist party,\u201d Lindner wrote.\nMusk has increasingly thrown his support behind far-right causes in Europe. Earlier this year, Musk agitated anti-immigration riots in the UK, writing on his social media platform that \u201ccivil war is inevitable\u201d in response to a post blaming the violent demonstrations on the effects of \u201cmass migration and open borders.\u201d\nEarlier this week, Nigel Farage, the far-right populist British politician and Trump ally, said Musk was considering funding his Reform UK party.\nWriting in the Telegraph newspaper, Farage said that after meeting with Musk he \u201cleft us in no doubt that he is right behind us\u201d and was in \u201congoing negotiations\u201d about making a financial contribution.\nMost stock quote data provided by BATS.

If the insulted person insults back, judges\u00a0generally dismiss the case.\nImprisonment is very rare, and harsh punishments are an option only for repeat offenders or when the insult is seen as being in combination with racism or\u00a0antisemitism.\nA defamation case is taken on\u00a0by the relevant court\u00a0only at the request of the harmed party, who\u00a0must first file a police report.\u00a0There then needs to be a police investigation.\u00a0The person pressing charges is also required\u00a0to get an attorney to deal with the case and needs to prove the offender's guilt to the judge.\nAs a result, in most cases, insults are not reported\u00a0\u2014\u00a0and the politicians insulted by Elon Musk on social media have not indicated any intention to press\u00a0charges.\nHowever, recently, there have been several cases where German politicians have taken legal action against insults, especially on social media.\nEconomy Minister Robert Habeck from the Green Party, for example, authorized prosecutors to pursue \"insult\" charges \u00a0\u00a0for a social media post referring to him as an idiot (Schwachkopf).However there are indications that law enforcement had first invited or asked Habeck to press the charges.\nHabeck was also insulted as an idiot\u00a0by Musk in a post on X in November.\nGreen Party supporters, in particular, have increasingly become targets of\u00a0attacks. Local politicians\u00a0have also been physically\u00a0attacked, threatened and insulted.\nThe US billionaire's next show of support for the AfD is expected to come soon: According to an AfD spokesperson, concrete plans are being made for a meeting between Musk and AfD leader Alice Weidel on the X-Space chat feature.\nWhile you're here: Every Tuesday, DW editors round up what is happening in German politics and society.

            "content": "Elon Musk praised far-right party Alternative for Germany (AfD) and its leader Alice Weidel in an opinion piece for German newspaper Welt am Sonntag.\nGermany\u2019s government accused US billionaire Elon Musk on Monday of interfering in its upcoming February election after he threw his support behind the far-right party, Alternative for Germany (AfD) in X posts and an opinion piece published by the newspaper Welt am Sonntag.\nGerman leaders accused Musk, who claimed that AfD is the only party which can \u201csave\u201d Germany, of trying to \u201cinfluence the federal election\u201d as the country heads towards snap elections amid political turmoil next month.\n\n\n\n\nSo what happened and what does it all mean?\nSince 2013, the Social Democratic Party of Germany (SPD) has governed Germany, which is Europe\u2019s largest economy, leading different coalition governments.\nHowever, the German Chancellor, Olaf Scholz of the SPD, lost a confidence vote in parliament on December 16.\nThe vote, tabled by Scholz himself apparently in a bid to trigger an early election, came after the collapse of the German governing coalition government headed by Scholz and SPD. The government was thrown into turmoil when Scholz fired Finance Minister Christian Lindner in November following months of disagreements over Germany\u2019s budget.\nAnalysts say Scholz fully expected to lose the vote but wanted to trigger earlier elections, which he sees as his party\u2019s last chance to cling to any power. Before Monday\u2019s vote, Scholz said an election would be an opportunity to set the country on a new course.\nFollowing the vote of no confidence, the German parliament was dissolved by President Frank-Walter Steinmeier of SPD on Friday, and snap elections were called for February 23, 2025, seven months before parliamentary elections were originally scheduled to take place.\nThe Alternative for Germany (AfD) is considered to be a far-right populist party in Germany. It was founded in 2013 and was holding 76 seats out of the 733 seats in the German parliament, or Bundestag before dissolution.\nAfD is a Eurosceptic party, which means it is critical of Germany\u2019s integration into the European Union.\nAfD is also openly critical of Islam and opposes mass immigration. The party opposed former German Chancellor Angela Merkel\u2019s welcoming stance towards immigrants arriving from the Middle East and Africa. In 2015, under Merkel\u2019s leadership, more than 1 million refugees arrived in Germany.\nIn September this year, AfD won a key election for the eight Landtag seats of the eastern state of Thuringia with 32.8 percent of the vote, marking the first state election win for a far-right party since World War II.\nThe AfD nominated party leader Alice Weidel as its candidate for chancellor in early December. The nomination is largely symbolic since the party is unlikely to win a majority. Once the Bundestag is elected, it votes for the chancellor. To become chancellor, a candidate needs to receive votes from more than half of the parliament.\nFor the upcoming election, the latest polls place AfD in second place with support from 19 percent of the electorate as of December 28, according to Politico. In the first place, with 30 percent, is the conservative coalition comprising centre-right parties Christian Democratic Union of Germany (CDU) and the Christian Social Union in Bavaria (CSU).\nThe previous governing group, SPD, is in third place, with 17 percent support projected.\nThe mainstream parties have refused to work with AfD in government, but it is nevertheless projected to form the largest opposition in parliament following the upcoming elections.\nOn December 20, Musk posted on X, the social media platform he owns: \u201cOnly the AfD can save Germany.\u201d\nMusk, who has become a close aide to US President-elect Donald Trump, expanded on his support for the AfD in an opinion piece for Welt am Sonntag, a German Sunday newspaper. The paper is published by the Axel Springer media group, which also owns US-based political site, Politico.\nMusk\u2019s article was published online on Sunday. Translated, it reads: \u201cThe portrayal of the AfD as right-wing extremist is clearly false, considering that Alice Weidel, the party\u2019s leader, has a same-sex partner from Sri Lanka! Does that sound like Hitler to you? Please!\u201d\nHe wrote that Germany is on \u201cthe brink of economic and cultural collapse\u201d and \u201cAfD can save Germany from becoming a shadow of its former self\u201d.\nMusk wrote that he had \u201csignificant investments\u201d in Germany, which gave him the right to comment about the country.\nSaying that Germany\u2019s traditional parties have failed in Germany, Musk wrote, \u201cThe AfD, even though it is described as far-right, represents a political realism that resonates with many Germans who feel their concerns are ignored by the establishment.\u201d\nMusk has openly backed other far-right figures recently, including Nigel Farage of the United Kingdom\u2019s Reform party and Italy\u2019s right-wing Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni. On Thursday, Musk posted on X campaigning for the release of far-right UK activist Tommy Robinson.\nRobinson was jailed for 18 months in October 2024 after he made false accusations against a Syrian refugee schoolboy.\nMusk, who was born in South Africa but is also a naturalised US citizen, has also been known for getting involved in US politics and was a prominent part of Trump\u2019s presidential campaign. Last month, Trump refuted claims that he had \u201cceded the presidency\u201d to Musk.\n\n\n\n\u201cIt is indeed the case that Elon Musk is trying to influence the federal election,\u201d German government spokesperson Christiane Hoffmann said at a regular media briefing on Monday.\n\u201cAfter all, freedom of opinion also covers the greatest nonsense.\u201d\nFriedrich Merz, leader of the opposition Christian Democrats and the current favourite to be elected chancellor in the upcoming elections, described Musk\u2019s words as \u201cintrusive and pretentious\u201d in an interview with German newspaper Funke Media Group.\n\u201cI cannot recall a comparable case of interference, in the history of Western democracies, in the election campaign of a friendly country,\u201d Merz said.\n\u201cIn Elon Musk\u2019s world, democracy and workers\u2019 rights are obstacles to more profit,\u201d Saskia Esken, co-leader of SPD told Reuters. \u201cWe say quite clearly: Our democracy is defensible and it cannot be bought.\u201d\nShortly after Musk\u2019s piece was published, Eva Marie Kogel, the opinions editor at Welt am Sonntag, announced her resignation on X.\n\u201cI always enjoyed heading the opinion section,\u201d Kogel wrote in an X post on December 28. \u201cToday an article by Elon Musk appeared in Welt am Sonntag. I handed in my resignation yesterday after it went to print.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFollow Al Jazeera English:",

It is up to a judge to decide whose right weighs stronger.\nIn the German criminal code, there is a whole category of \"crimes of honor\" (\"Ehrdelikte\") that\u00a0includes everything from spreading lies about another person to defamation. The code makes certain kinds of statements punishable as insults, slander, or defamation. It\u00a0also declares as\u00a0illegal the propagation of\u00a0false statements about an individual that harm her or his\u00a0personal or professional reputation or cause\u00a0financial losses or emotional distress.\nThe offense of \"insult\"\u00a0(\"Beleidigung\") comes with a maximum penalty of two years in jail, although perpetrators normally get no more than\u00a0a fine. If the insulted person insults back, judges\u00a0generally dismiss the case.\nImprisonment is very rare, and harsh punishments are an option only for repeat offenders or when the insult is seen as being in combination with racism or\u00a0antisemitism.\nA defamation case is taken on\u00a0by the relevant court\u00a0only at the request of the harmed party, who\u00a0must first file a police report.\u00a0There then needs to be a police investigation.\u00a0The person pressing charges is also required\u00a0to get an attorney to deal with the case and needs to prove the offender's guilt to the judge.\nAs a result, in most cases, insults are not reported\u00a0\u2014\u00a0and the politicians insulted by Elon Musk on social media have not indicated any intention to press\u00a0charges.\nHowever, recently, there have been several cases where German politicians have taken legal action against insults, especially on social media.\nEconomy Minister Robert Habeck from the Green Party, for example, authorized prosecutors to pursue \"insult\" charges \u00a0\u00a0for a social media post referring to him as an idiot (Schwachkopf).However there are indications that law enforcement had first invited or asked Habeck to press the charges.\nHabeck was also insulted as an idiot\u00a0by Musk in a post on X in November.\nGreen Party supporters, in particular, have increasingly become targets of\u00a0attacks. Local politicians\u00a0have also been physically\u00a0attacked, threatened and insulted.\nThe US billionaire's next show of support for the AfD is expected to come soon: According to an AfD spokesperson, concrete plans are being made for a meeting between Musk and AfD leader Alice Weidel on the X-Space chat feature.\nWhile you're here: Every Tuesday, DW editors round up what is happening in German politics and society.

Musk erroneously stated that Weidel was the most popular candidate, despite her party trailing in polls.

The meandering conversation may not have helped Alice Weidel as much as she hoped, say pundits.\nPerhaps unsurprisingly, the conversation between Elon Musk and Alternative for Germany (AfD) leader Alice Weidel began with a straight-up untruth: Alice Weidel, according to a claim by the multibillionaire owner of the social media\u00a0platform X, was the most popular chancellor candidate in Germany \"according to the polls.\"\nWeidel's far-right party is actually second in the national opinion polls, 11 points behind the conservative Christian Democratic Union (CDU), and Weidel herself is joint bottom in terms of popularity among Germany's chancellor candidates in the upcoming February 23 election.\nAn Infratest dimap poll also released on Thursday showed that only 20% of Germans are satisfied with Weidel's current performance \u2014 the same as Chancellor Olaf Scholz of the center-left Social Democratic Party, who\u00a0has\u00a0historically low approval ratings.\nThe erroneous introduction from Musk was followed by a rambling 70-minute conversation, occasionally rendered awkward by language-based misunderstandings, that was punctuated with several wildly misleading claims \u2014 at one stage, Musk said that theft was legal in California, while Weidel insisted that Adolf Hitler was a communist.\nTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video\nIn between laughing at each other's jokes, the two also discussed Germany's energy supply, the merits of nuclear power, immigration, the war in Ukraine,\u00a0war in the Middle East\u00a0and other topics.\nMusk expressed his confidence that US President-elect Donald Trump would end the conflicts in Ukraine and the Gaza Strip quickly, while Weidel described what she called the mismanagement of Germany over the last two decades.\nThe pair agreed that the bureaucratic burdens were too great for companies looking to expand operations in Germany \u2014 something that Musk has experienced\u00a0with his Tesla Gigafactory outside Berlin. However, he did acknowledge that both the state and federal governments of Germany had ultimately\u00a0provided a lot of support for the factory.\nIn fact, Musk and Weidel spent much of the conversation agreeing with each other's wild claims. The only moment of minor disagreement came near the beginning, when Musk said he did believe in the benefits of renewable energy, though he thought, like Weidel, that Germany needed to reopen its nuclear plants.\nBut the big question for Weidel was whether the discussion would help her in the upcoming election.\u00a0Though Musk repeated his endorsement of the party, insisting again that only the AfD can \"save\" Germany, political pundits were doubtful that Weidel made a significant impression.\n\"To be honest I'm a bit astounded by how poor her performance was,\" said Bendix H\u00fcgelmann, a German political communications strategist and founder of the consultancy People on the Hill. \"This is a big moment, but ... I think she totally missed the opportunity that was given to her to build on her public profile, and give the impression of a highly-educated, super-sophisticated new prototype of a future right-wing politician.\"\nTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video\nH\u00fcgelmann was also surprised at some of the difficulties Weidel had expressing herself in English. \"She didn't speak poorly, don't get me wrong,\" he said. \"But I think for a 70-minute conversation with Mr. Musk I think she could've prepared a bit better.\"\nThe event did not, H\u00fcgelmann said, compare well with Trump's\u00a0appearance on the Joe Rogan podcast during the US election campaign, when the Republican candidate appeared more relaxed than many had seen him before, and was able to spend three hours reaching a massive online audience.\n\"I think the Joe Rogan interview with Donald Trump lived from this very casual tone that they both found, but from what I heard Ms. Weidel had difficulties matching this American style of getting a nice flow in the conversation,\" said H\u00fcgelmann.\n\"She had a very academic take, which had a huge contrast to the way Mr. Musk presented his arguments. But I would maybe explain this by the language barrier.\"\nAccording to\u00a0figures\u00a0from X, around 200,000 people listened live to the conversation, though the numbers began to fall towards the end, when the talk drifted into Musk's plans for space exploration.\nBut then again, Weidel may still count the talk a success. For Philipp Adorf, political scientist at Bonn University, the main purpose of the event for Weidel was to not to convince a German audience, but to introduce herself to a US audience \u2014 particularly a right-wing audience in and around the corridors of power in Washington.\n\"It was an attempt to stretch out feelers in the US and to make more contact with members of the Trump administration, and perhaps to work together, or at least to be seen as a partner in Europe,\" he said.\nTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video\nHow successful this will be remains open: Contrary to social media rumors ahead of the event, Weidel did not travel to the US to speak to Musk and possibly to attend the inauguration of Trump on January 20. Wednesday's X-based event was an audio-only chat that Weidel joined from her office in Berlin.\nWeidel managed to repeat many of her familiar talking points \u2014 that the CDU's Angela Merkel had in fact been Germany's first \"Green\" chancellor, and that she had ruined the country by opening the border to refugees. But according to Adorf, she may have wanted more time to discuss Germany's domestic issues.\n\"From Weidel's perspective it might have been disappointing that they spoke relatively little about the AfD's main issue: immigration,\" he told DW. \"At the beginning she got a bit caught up in discussing energy policy, which I think is perhaps not super interesting for a larger audience.\"\nWhat she did more successfully, according to Adorf, was present the party as a moderates that merely makes demands that center-right parties used to make.\nBut all in all, he said, the talk\u00a0may have been too casual.\u00a0\"I found the conversation sounded a bit disorganized to me, especially toward\u00a0the end, when Weidel asked Musk what he thought of various issues,\" said Adorf.\nIn this later part of the discussion, the pair drifted into philosophical topics, culminating in Weidel asking Musk whether he believed in God. The science-fiction-obsessed billionaire said he believed in a physics-based approach to divinity, before saying he had an existential crisis at the age of 12 or 13, which was resolved by reading Douglas Adams' 1979 novel \"The Hitchhiker's Guide To The Galaxy.\"\n\"That led me to conclude that we should expand the scope and scale of consciousness, so that we're better able to know what questions to ask about the answers to the universe,\" Musk said. \"We should take the sort of actions that lead to a greater understanding of the universe.\"\nAt this point, Weidel appeared overwhelmed, wrapping up the conversation by\u00a0describing his final words as \"beautiful.\" It remains to be seen whether the AfD's plan to deport thousands of immigrants will lead to the greater understanding that Musk aspires to.\nEdited by: Wesley Dockery\nWhile you're here: Every Tuesday, DW editors round up what is happening in German politics and society.

Musk was impressed \u2014 and renewed his election recommendation for the AfD as the \"only party that can save Germany.\"\nTheir conversation lasted more than an hour. Here are some of the most controversial claims, and what the facts say.\nTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video\nThe claim:\u00a0Musk presented\u00a0Weidel in the title of his X\u00a0Space chat as \"the leading candidate to run Germany.\"\nThe facts:\u00a0If Musk meant to suggest that Weidel was leading in opinion polls, his claim was not correct.\u00a0Weidel's\u00a0far-right\u00a0AfD\u00a0is currently in second place, according to a survey\u00a0ahead of the\u00a0February 23 federal election in Germany.\nThe center-right CDU and its Bavarian sister party, the\u00a0CSU, are currently the strongest political force in Germany\u00a0with\u00a031% suppoert, based on the most recent polling from\u00a0ARD Deutschlandtrend. The AfD is polling at around 20%.\nNeither is Weidel leading as an individual candidate.\nBased on the same nationwide survey, which is conducted by Infratest dimap, Weidel placed in fifth\u00a0when it comes to satisfaction with the work of various candidates.\nOnly 20% of respondents said they were satisfied with Weidel as a candidate for chancellor. She was behind Robert Habeck, the chancellor candidate for the environmentalist Greens at 28%, the CDU's Friedrich Merz at 25%, Sarah Wagenknecht, with her own new eponymous party BSW at 21%\u00a0and the business-focused\u00a0FDP's Christian Lindner, also at 21%.\nOlaf Scholz, the incumbent German chancellor from the center-left SPD, ranked similarly to Weidel, although\u00a0other polls\u00a0have shown her ahead of Merz and Scholz. Nevertheless, most polls do not show Weidel with a chance of winning the German election\n\nThe claim:\u00a0During her talk\u00a0with the Musk on\u00a0X,\u00a0Weidel claimed, \"Germany is the only industrial country that unplugged the nuclear power plant.\"\nThe facts:\u00a0Italy shut down its nuclear plants more than three decades before Germany. Shortly after the Chernobyl disaster, a nationwide\u00a0referendum\u00a0was held in Italy in 1987. According to the archives\u00a0of the Italian Interior Ministry,\u00a0nearly 80% of participants voted in favor of shutting down the country's nuclear plants. By 1990, Italy had phased out all its existing nuclear facilities.\nBy\u00a0comparison, Germany closed its last remaining nuclear plants in 2023.\nThe claim:\u00a0Weidel claimed during the X-Space chatt\u00a0that \"nuclear energy supply is carbon-free.\"\nThe facts:\u00a0Nuclear energy is considered a carbon-free source of electricity by some institutions,\u00a0because it does not produce carbon dioxide (CO2) or other greenhouse gases during its operation. That is why some political parties like Weidel's AfD critisize the decision to phase out\u00a0nuclear energy, as some see nuclear power as an alternative for the energy mix in Germany.\nBut considering the entire life cycle of a nuclear plant, nuclear energy does produce\u00a0emissions.\u00a0The life cycle emissions of nuclear power plants include all stages from uranium mining\u00a0to plant construction, operation, decommissioning\u00a0and waste management.\n\nNuclear energy certainly has lower CO2 emissions than coal or natural gas, but it is not \"carbon free.\"\nThe figures on how much CO2 a nuclear power plant generates per kilowatt-hour vary: In 2014,\u00a0an IPCC report\u00a0estimated a range from 4 to 110 grams of CO2 equivalent per kilowatt-hour (kWh) \u2014\u00a0so it's not carbon neutral.\nA\u00a0UK-based study\u00a0found that nuclear power has a minimal carbon footprint of around\u00a015\u201350 grams of CO2\u00a0per kilowatt hour.\nThe processes to mine and refine uranium ore\u00a0require huge amounts of energy, often from fossil fuels. And the construction of a nuclear plant, with the large amounts of concrete and steel needed, is also\u00a0a significant cause of CO2 emissions.\n\nThe claim:\u00a0\"Without asking the people, she [Angela Merkel]\u00a0enforced to open our borders to illegal immigration,\"\u00a0Weidel said during the live talk.\nThe facts:\u00a0Weidel is referring to the events of early September 2015,\u00a0when thousands of refugees, many coming from Syria, made their way from Hungary to Germany via Austria. Then-Chancellor Angela Merkel decided not to close the border to stop them and temporarily suspended rules which would have meant return to the first EU country or safe transit country. This decision has been highly debated ever since.\n\nThe claim that Merkel \"opened\"\u00a0the borders\u00a0is not accurate.\u00a0In 2015, all of Germany\u2018s neighboring countries were part of the so-called Schengen area, meaning there were no border controls between any of those countries and Germany. Later, in 2021, the rules for border controls were changed by the EU in its communication\"A strategy towards a fully functioning and resilient Schengen area.\"\nOn\u00a0September 13, 2015, the German government instituted temporary border controls with Austria.\nThere has been political debate about whether or not the government should have stopped the refugees from entering Germany in the first place. The country\u2018s immigration law states that foreigners shall be refused entry if they enter from a safe third country, which includes Austria.\nThe German government has argued that it acted in accordance with the EU\u2019s Dublin III regulations on immigration, which allow a state to examine someone's asylum application, even if it is not obliged to.\nIn 2017, the European Court of Justiceconfirmed that EU states may indeed take in asylum-seekers voluntarily, but that such border crossings may still be illegal under the Dublin Regulation.\nThe claim:\u00a0\"Theft is legal in California,\" Musk claimed, adding\u00a0that if stolen goods are below $1,000 (around \u20ac970), thieves allegedly won't be prosecuted.\nThe facts:\u00a0Theft is not legal in California, as\u00a0can be seen for example in this\u00a0press release\u00a0by the state's governor, reporting about a statewide enforcement operation targeting organized retail theft crime.\nThe claim, which has previously been stated by US President-elect\u00a0Donald Trump,\u00a0refers to Proposition 47, a significant criminal justice reform approved by California voters in 2014, which aimed to reduce penalties for certain theft and drug possession offenses.\nUnder\u00a0Proposition 47,\u00a0which was passed in 2014, the theft of goods valued at $950 or less are classified as a misdemeanor, not a felony. This reclassification was part of a broader criminal justice reform effort aimed at reducing prison overcrowding. However, theft under $950 is still illegal and punishable by up to six months in jail and fines of up to $1,000.\nProposition 47 did not decriminalize theft but changed how crimes are prosecuted. The law eliminated the discretion of prosecutors to charge theft under $950 as a felony, except in cases involving repeat offenders or certain aggravating circumstances.\nWhile enforcement may be constrained in some cases due to practical considerations like jail overcrowding, law enforcement agencies and the California Highway Patrol continue to target theft, especially organized retail crime.\nFor instance, statewide operations in December continued to lead to arrests, recovery of stolen goods, and measures to deter retail theft.\nThe claim: \"In Germany, we had an influx of almost 7 million people, but these are the officially counted ones,\" Weidel claimed, while accusing the German government of wasting money on immigration and blaming it for unregulated, illegal migration.\nImmediately after that, Weidel shifted the discussion toward undocumented migrants who enter Germany without a passport, failing to clearly distinguish between them and other categories of migrants.\nThe facts:\u00a0The figure Weidel cited \u2014 an \"influx of 7 million people\" \u2014 is roughly in line with official data on migration to Germany. According to the Federal Statistical Office,\u00a0this number reflects total migration figures since 2015.\nHowever, Weidel's statement is misleading because it conflates different types of migration. It groups together legal migration, such as skilled workers and business owners, with asylum-seekers.\nAccording to Eurostat, Germany has received approximately 3 million asylum applications since 2015, with some applications ultimately being rejected.\nAnna Bakovic contributed to this fact check.\nEdited by: Wesley Dockery",

In a recent interview with the American Conservative bimonthly magazine, Weidel said Germans are a \u201cdefeated people\u201d and suggested Germany is a \u201cslave\u201d to the U.S.\nBut for AfD leaders, Trump could redefine America\u2019s role in the world and become a key ally.\nWeidel suggested as much during her convention speech, implying that an AfD-led government would be uniquely placed to pursue strong ties with both the Kremlin and the Trump administration, making Germany \u2014 in the still far-fetched scenario that the party governs after February\u2019s election \u2014 a bridge between Putin and Trump.\nThe AfD \u201cis the only party that has all channels of communication open to the East and the West,\u201d she said.\nThe Trump administration hasn\u2019t clearly thrown its support behind the AfD, but Musk\u2019s advocacy for the party has at least sparked some interest in high places.\nEarlier this month, Vice President-elect JD Vance reposted on X an English-language translation of Musk\u2019s\u00a0opinion piece\u00a0in Germany\u2019s\u00a0Welt am Sonntag\u00a0newspaper, in which he called the party the \u201clast spark of hope\u201d for the country.\n\u201cI\u2019m not endorsing a party in the German elections, as it\u2019s not my country and we hope to have good relations with all Germans,\u201d Vance wrote. \u201cBut this is an interesting piece.\u201d\nVance went on to defend the party, claiming the \u201cAmerican media slanders AfD as Nazi-lite.\u201d\nMany German mainstream leaders, including conservatives, have warned that the AfD peddles Nazi ideology; meanwhile, Germany\u2019s federal domestic intelligence agency has classified it as a suspected right-wing extremist organization. The party\u2019s leader in the eastern German state of Thuringia, Bj\u00f6rn H\u00f6cke, has been found guilty of using a banned slogan employed by Adolf Hitler\u2019s SA storm troopers; a German court once ruled H\u00f6cke could justifiably be called a fascist.\nA defense of the party from someone of Vance\u2019s stature serves to undermine warnings from German officials, potentially legitimizing the AfD among voters. It also raises questions about  future relations between the Trump administration and the next German government, which, according to current polls, is likely to be led by conservative chancellor candidate Friedrich Merz.\nMerz\u2019s conservatives, like other German parliamentary parties, have vowed not to govern with the AfD. But party leaders are playing the long game, hoping to build enough popularity over time that other parties find it impossible to exclude them.\nIt\u2019s still far from clear that Musk\u2019s endorsement of the AfD will help it in that regard, even as polls show the party has become more popular in recent weeks. The AfD is in second place behind Germany\u2019s conservatives in polls, with support of around 21 percent.\nThere are also other sources of foreign support much closer to home that could also benefit the AfD.\nOne of the biggest boosts for the party may come from Austria, where the successes of Herbert Kickl and his far-right Freedom Party (FP\u00d6) \u2014 who appear poised to take power in Vienna after coalition talks among mainstream parties collapsed earlier this month \u2014 have emboldened German far-right leaders, who see in Austria a roadmap for how they too might one day take power.\nAfD leaders view the FP\u00d6 as a \u201csister party,\u201d and feel that should their Austrian sibling take power, it could further destigmatize the AfD in the eyes of German voters.\n\u201cAustria is ahead of us in terms of development,\u201d H\u00f6cke, the AfD\u2019s Thuringia leader, wrote in a post on X.\nJust a year ago, things weren\u2019t looking so rosy for the AfD.\nLast January, outraged Germans took to the streets in huge numbers to protest against the radical right after an investigative report by Correctiv\u00a0revealed that AfD politicians had been present at a meeting of right-wing extremists, at which a \u201cmaster plan\u201d to deport migrants and \u201cunassimilated citizens\u201d en masse was discussed. The attendees euphemistically dubbed the plot \u201cremigration.\u201d\nThe sustained protest movement, which drew millions in cities across the country, appeared to damage the AfD \u2014\u00a0leading many Germans to question whether the demonstrators had put a halt to the party\u2019s rise. Even France\u2019s far-right leader Marine Le Pen moved to distance herself from the AfD, if only in a bid to depict her own party as more palatable for French voters.\nA year later, however, the AfD has largely recovered, and is approaching the record-high polling numbers it enjoyed before the protest movement. During that time, Trump was elected on a platform that included a promise to carry out mass deportations.\nIn an illustration of how extremist ideas can rapidly become normal with a little rhetorical resonance from the party\u2019s friends across the Atlantic, the AfD\u2019s national leaders, who used to avoid uttering the word \u201cremigration\u201d in light of the controversy, are now fully embracing the term.\nDuring her speech at the AfD convention, Weidel vowed to seal Germany\u2019s borders and enact \u201clarge-scale repatriations\u201d once in power.\n\u201cI have to tell you quite honestly: If it\u2019s to be called remigration, then it\u2019s just called remigration,\u201d Weidel declared to spirited applause.\nThe \u201cchameleon\u201d tech billionaire is one of the most powerful politically connected people in the world. Europe\u2019s governments are still working out how to deal with being on his bad side.\nDissolving of parliament sets the stage for what could be Germany\u2019s sharpest swerve to the right in decades.\nThe conservative leader\u2019s attacks signal the next government may be just as discordant as the one that recently fell.\nFriedrich Merz wants to make Germany great again, but his country is confronting global risks beyond the control of any domestic leader.",

            "content": "God! Martians! A \u201ccommunist\u201d Hitler! It was heavy on oddness and light on policy as the X owner and the AfD co-leader hit it off.\nBERLIN \u2014 With lots of laughter, earnest agreement and effusive mutual appreciation, it started off like a promising date between two nervous teenagers (she even forgave him for getting her name wrong).\nBut by the end of the night, Elon Musk\u2019s live conversation with far-right German politician Alice Weidel had veered off the rails \u2014 and indeed off the planet entirely \u2014 into a rambling dialogue about Hitler, the existence of God, and why \u201cfuture Martians\u201d will one day save the Earth.\nMusk\u2019s decision last month to endorse Weidel\u2019s Alternative for Germany (AfD) party earned him a storm of criticism from European politicians. But he shrugged it off \u2014 despite the threat of a regulatory investigation \u2014 and offered up his X social media platform, formerly known as Twitter, so she could speak to voters ahead of Germany\u2019s Feb. 23 election.\nWeidel is standing to succeed Olaf Scholz as German chancellor, and while that seems a long way off, her party is attracting significant support and is currently in second place on about 20 percent in the polls.\nIn the meandering  \u2014 sometimes surreal \u2014 85-minute chat, Donald Trump\u2019s favorite entrepreneur, who is the boss of Tesla, a space travel enthusiast and the world\u2019s richest man, restated his heartfelt support for Weidel, claiming her party was the best hope for saving Germany.\nThen it went weird. Here is a summary of the oddest parts of the conversation between the X owner and the co-chair of the AfD:\n\u201cWelcome to the conversation with Alice Weidel, who is currently the leading candidate to run Germany, I think,\u201d Musk declared as the X conversation opened. Unfortunately, he pronounced her name incorrectly as \u201cVeedle.\u201d\nMusk decided to show off his knowledge of German history, including \u201cHitler and whatnot.\u201d He asked Weidel to address media portrayals of the AfD as \u201csomehow associated with Nazism or something like that.\u201d\n\u201cHmm, hmm,\u201d she replied. \u201cThank you for that question.\u201d\n\u201cHe was a communist and he considered himself as a socialist.\u201d She went on: \u201cThe biggest success after that terrible era in our history was to label Adolf Hitler as right and conservative. He was exactly the opposite. He wasn't a conservative. He wasn't a libertarian. He was a communist socialist guy. Full stop. No more comment on that. And we are exactly the opposite.\u201d\nWeidel made the rather odd argument that Hitler \u201cwould never have been successful\u201d if he had not first \u201cswitched off free speech.\u201d His party won the most seats in the German election of 1933. After that he got to work on what Musk, a free-speech fundamentalist, called \u201cextreme censorship.\u201d\nWeidel cited POLITICO\u2019s story revealing how 150 EU officials will be monitoring their conversation to see if Musk was breaking the bloc\u2019s digital rules by giving her party an advantage. Musk clearly isn\u2019t worried.\n\u201cThe American people are demanding change,\u201d he said. \u201cMy recommendation to the people in Germany is to do the same \u2026 I am really strongly recommending that people vote for the AfD.\u201d\nIn case those Brussels officials hadn\u2019t quite got the point, he added: \u201cI think Alice Weidel is a very reasonable person. And hopefully people can tell just from this conversation, like nothing outrageous is being proposed, just common sense. So, in fact, as I said publicly, I think only AfD can save Germany.\u201d\nWeidel took her chance to ask the SpaceX mastermind why he was focusing so much money and attention on developing plans to travel to Mars. Several light years later, he arrived at an answer, of sorts: Because the dinosaurs \u201cdidn\u2019t have spaceships\u201d.\n\u201cA lot of people think there must be aliens but I have not seen any evidence of aliens,\u201d Musk explained. There\u2019s a big chance of a humanity-ending event occurring \u2014\u00a0like \u201ca giant meteor\u201d crashing into Earth like the one that did for the dinosaurs, or a nuclear war. \u201cThere is some risk.\u201d\n\u201cTo be clear, if we are a single planet species, it is just a matter of time before we are annihilated.\u201d\nThis is the kind of downbeat comment that can be a real mood-killer on a date. Weidel listened on in silence. Quickly, though, Musk tried to make amends with some more long-term positivity.\n\u201cI think we can send uncrewed starships to Mars in approximately two years.\u201d\nThere will be a lot of work ahead, though, if we are going to save the human race, Musk said. He estimated it would take about 1 million tons of material and 1 million people to make life self-sustaining on the red planet. But once that little hurdle is overcome, humanity will be laughing \u2014 almost as much as Weidel and Musk were.\n\u201cMy guess is that there will be cases where the future Martians actually come and help and rescue us when there is an emergency, just as America has helped to rescue the rest of world in World War 1 and 2 and the Cold War,\" he said.\n\u201cAs for humanity, we don't want to be one of those lame, one-planet-civilizations. Any self-respecting civilization should have at least two planets.\u201d\nWeidel followed the spaced-out riffing on the end of humanity with a classic deep-and-meaningful, end-of-the-night question. \u201cDo you believe in God?\u201d she asked.\n\u201cI'm open to believing in things that are proportionate to the information that I receive,\u201d he replied, indicating he was \u201copen to the idea\u201d of God. \u201cI try to form my opinions based on what I learn. And as I learn more, I aspire to change my views.\u201d\nAgain, it wasn\u2019t perhaps the profound poetry that Weidel\u2019s question deserved. But she didn\u2019t mind. \u201cYes, same here,\u201d she said. \u201cTo be honest, I\u2019m still on a search.\u201d\nMusk had more to say on the existentialist theme. \u201cI'm curious about the nature of the universe. I would say I subscribe to the Douglas Adams School of Philosophy that was described in 'The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy.' In that book, the Earth was sort of a giant computer that was trying to answer the question, 'what is the meaning of life?' And that goes back with 42 and what does 42 mean?\n\u201cAnd actually the answer is the easy part, and the question is the hard part. That was actually quite an illuminating thing for me, because I had sort of an existential crisis when I was 12 or 13 about the meaning of life. I read the religious texts and the bookstore philosophy. I was reading Schopenhauer,\u201d he said, \u201cwhich is a bit depressing if you're to read it as a child.\u201d\nIt wasn\u2019t all froth and frivolity. Musk and Weidel also discussed the conflict in the Middle East and how the Ukraine war could escalate into nuclear Armageddon. \u201cI want to have strong leaders in Germany,\u201d she said. \u201cThis is also my hope in Donald Trump and in your administration that you end that terrible war [in Ukraine], this worthless dying of young people every day, as fast as you can, because the Europeans, they cannot.\u201d\nMusk reassured her: \u201cI think President Trump is going to solve that conflict very quickly.

Since Musk's endorsement of the AfD, he has expressed a sympathetic view toward the party, which is classified as extremist by Germany's federal intelligence. The discussion, expected to lack structure, may not significantly impact the elections, as polls show the AfD currently at 20%. However, legal issues may arise from the livestream, potentially classifying it as illegal election advertising under German law.",
            "content": "Elon Musk\u2019s live chat with Alice Weidel of the AfD on X comes as Germany\u2019s national election looms.\nAI generated Text-to-speech\nAhead of tech billionaire Elon Musk\u2019s livestreamed chat with Alice Weidel, chancellor candidate for the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) party, there\u2019s one thing we\u2019re pretty sure we can rule out: a critical discussion involving competing views.\nSince Musk endorsed the AfD in a post on X in December, writing \u201cOnly the AfD can save Germany,\u201d the affection between the party leader and the tech billionaire has been palpable.\n\u201cYes! You are perfectly right!\u201d Weidel\u00a0posted\u00a0on X in reponse to Musk\u2019s endorsement.\nAside from a generous dollop of far-right bonhomie, here\u2019s a quick rundown of what else to expect when the pair virtually sit down together on X.\n1. A lack of structure\nThe live, audio-only discussion is taking place on Thursday at 7 p.m. CET and 1 p.m. EST on the streaming feature of Musk\u2019s platform X, called Spaces. If Musk\u2019s previous livestream discussion with then-candidate Donald Trump back in August proves to be any guide, the conversation will be largely unstructured and rambling, and possibly glitchy.\nThe chat is scheduled to last up to an hour and is intended to be largely off the cuff, a spokesperson for Weidel told Politico\u2019s Berlin Playbook, as this is in line with \u201cMusk\u2019s nature.\u201d\n2. The far-right echo chamber in action\nAt risk of stating the obvious, don\u2019t expect a balanced and deeply nuanced discussion of the state of German politics.\nIn an opinion essay he wrote for German newspaper Welt am Sonntag, Musk argued that his \u201csignificant investments\u201d in Germany \u2014\u00a0there\u2019s a Tesla gigafactory outside Berlin \u2014 give him the right to opine about Europe\u2019s largest economy.\nBut it seems that Musk gets much of his information about Germany from X, which critics say increasingly resembles a far-right echo chamber. Musk, for instance, has reposted videos of Naomi Seibt, a right-wing influencer known for her closeness to the AfD and denial of climate change caused by humans, who German media have dubbed the \u201canti-Greta,\u201d in reference to Swedish climate activist Greta Thunberg. (In one video reposted by Musk, she described the German Greens\u2019 environmental policies as \u201ceco-socialist national suicide.\u201d)\nIn the past, Musk has seemed to struggle to try to understand German politics.\n\u201cWhy is there such a negative reaction from some about AfD?\u201d Musk\u00a0wrote\u00a0on his X platform in June. \u201cThey keep saying \u2018far right,\u2019 but the policies of AfD that I\u2019ve read about don\u2019t sound extremist. Maybe I\u2019m missing something.\u201d\nWhile Musk has since embraced the AfD, Germany\u2019s federal domestic intelligence agency continues to surveil the party, classifying it as a suspected extremist organization.\n3. Weidel\u2019s true colors?\nAlthough Weidel positions herself as a relative moderate in comparison to other AfD leaders, it possible she could get a little more radical in the friendly company of Musk.\nIn an interview with a U.S. outlet The American Conservative published this week, Weidel referred to Germans as a \u201cdefeated people\u201d and suggested they were \u201cslaves\u201d to the U.S.\nAnyone familiar with German radical-right ideology will recognize at least a hint of victim-perpetrator reversal there that posits the Germans as victims of history. Given that Musk is the AfD\u2019s new American friend, we wonder if the subject will come up.\n4. Whether there\u2019s an impact on the polls\nReputable pollsters in Germany say Musk\u2019s endorsement may not end up making much of a difference in Germany\u2019s Feb. 23 early election.\n\u201cIn the first survey we conducted this year, we found that this has not yet benefited the AfD,\u201d Manfred G\u00fcllner, the head of the Forsa Institute, said. \u201cI don\u2019t see very much potential for future change because Musk has become a negative figure.\u201d\nMusk\u2019s endorsement, however, does have the potential to help legitimize a party that German mainstream politicians have endeavored to depict as an utterly taboo choice.\nAll that we can say for certain is that the AfD is doing well, currently polling in second place at 20 percent, having risen a few percentage points in recent months.\n5. Legal trouble\nThe talk between Musk and Weidel is unlikely to be the end of this new transatlantic lovefest. But there may be lingering legal consequences.\nThe European Commission earlier this week\u00a0said\u00a0that Musk could land in legal trouble under the terms of the EU\u2019s new digital rulebook over the livestream, depending on the extent to which it is deemed to boost the AfD unfairly over rivals.\nMoreover, under German law, the event could potentially be deemed an illegal donation in the form of \u201celection advertising by third parties,\u201d transparency watchdog LobbyControl said in a statement, which could result in a hefty fine for the AfD.\nPauline von Pezold contributed reporting.\nChancellor Olaf Scholz\u2019s latest demand is likely to stall a \u20ac3 billion aid package to the war-ravaged country as Russian forces continue their advance.\n\u201cThe objective exchange of arguments is becoming increasingly difficult\u201d on the platform formerly known as Twitter, says defense ministry.\nThe EU\u2019s strategy to deal with the far-right Freedom Party heading for power in Vienna is \u2026 hope for the best.\nConservative chancellor candidate Friedrich Merz railed against the climate policies of the left-leaning parties he\u2019ll likely have to govern with.",

Scroll through for fact-checking of some of the claims raised during the talk, explainers and reactions.\nMarietje Schaake, a fellow at Stanford University and the author of the book \"The Tech Coup, How To Save Democracy From Silicon Valley,\" called\u00a0the talk between tech billionaire Elon Musk and AfD leader Alice Weidel\u00a0\"very awkward, uncomfortable and underwhelming.\"\nShe also added\u00a0that there were not that many people and she had expected a bigger audience.\u00a0\"I think all the fears about this having a major impact are probably not going to be substantiated,\" the expert\u00a0added.\nSchaake said that Musk is platforming far-right politicians and parties, not only through the streams, but also \"through the algorithm, through the ranking and the curation of information on his platform, which is very influential.\"\nIt remains to be seen whether that will have a big impact, Schaake said.\u00a0\"But I think the fact that he (Musk), as a confidant of President Trump, is trying to support these fringe parties, these far-right anti-establishment populist parties, says a lot,\" she added.\n\"And we must see it as being condoned by Trump, endorsed by Trump and really as a precursor for a dramatic change in the trans-Atlantic relation,\" Schaake stressed.\nTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video\nThe claim:\"[Angela Merkel] enforced, without asking the people, she enforced to open our borders to illegal immigration,\u201c Alice Weidel said during the live talk.\nThe facts: Alice Weidel is referring to the events of early September 2015, when thousands of refugees made their way from Hungary to Germany via Austria. Then-Chancellor Angela Merkel decided not to close the border to stop them and temporarily suspended rules which would have meant return to the first EU country or safe transit country. This decision has been highly debated ever since.\nThe claim that Merkel \"opened\"\u00a0the borders, is not accurate: In 2015, all of Germany\u2018s neighboring countries were part of the so-called Schengen area,\u00a0meaning that there were no border controls between any of those countries and Germany.\nOn 13 September 2015, the German government instituted temporary border controls with Austria.\nThere has been debate about whether or not the government should have stopped the refugees from entering Germany in the first place. The country\u2018s immigration law states that foreigners shall be refused entry if they enter from a safe third country, which Austria is.\nThe German government has argued that it acted in accordance with the EU\u2019s Dublin III Regulations on immigration, which allow a state to examine someone\u2019s asylum application even if it is not obliged to.\nThe European Court of Justice in 2017 confirmed that EU states may indeed take in asylum seekers voluntarily, but that such border crossings may still be illegal under the Dublin Regulation.\nThe far-right\u00a0Alternative for Germany (AfD) secured just over 30% of the vote in recent state\u00a0elections in Thuringia and Saxony, which was partly\u00a0attributed to the party's effectiveness at reaching first-time voters on TikTok.\nA study last year showed that politicians and figures linked to the AfD used TikTok as a \"parallel universe\" to spread extremism, while other German parties show \"weak performance\" on the platform.\nThis campaigning strategy, with a heavy focus on social media messaging and avenues traditional political campaigning might not reach, is also reminiscent of Donald Trump's own tactics.\nRead DW's analysis on how social media can shape Germany's election campaign.\n\nThe claim: Alice Weidel claimed during the Space with Musk, that \"nuclear energy supply is carbon-free.\"\nThe facts: By some institutions nuclear energy is considered a carbon-free source of electricity because it does not produce carbon dioxide (CO2) or other greenhouse gases during its operation.\u00a0But considering the entire life cycle of a nuclear plant, nuclear energy produces emissions. The life cycle emissions of nuclear power plants include all stages from uranium mining to plant construction, operation, decommissioning, and waste management. Nuclear energy certainly has lower CO2 emissions than coal or natural gas, but it is not \"carbon free.\"\nThe figures on how much CO2 a nuclear power plant generates per kilowatt-hour vary: In 2014, an IPCC report estimated a range from 4 to 110 grams of CO2 equivalent per kilowatt-hour (kWh) \u2013 so not carbon neutral.\nA\u00a0UK-based study found that nuclear power has a minimal carbon footprint of around\u00a015\u201350 grams of CO2\u00a0per kilowatt hour.\nThe processes to mine and refine uranium ore require huge amounts of energy, often from fossil fuels. And the construction of a nuclear plant, with the large amounts of concrete and steel needed, is also\u00a0a significant cause of CO2 emissions.\n\nThe claim:\u00a0Elon Musk presented Alice Weidel in the title of his Space as \"the leading candidate to run Germany.\"\nThe facts:\u00a0Alice Weidel's\u00a0far-right Alternative for Germany party (AfD)\u00a0is in second place according to surveys ahead of the upcoming federal elections in Germany.\nThe center-right CDU and CSU, which are running together are currently the strongest political force in Germany with\u00a031%, based on the most recent polling,\u00a0the ARD Deutschlandtrend. The AfD is polling at around 20%.\nIn terms of individual candidates, Musk's description of Alice Weidel was not correct. Based on the same nationwide survey, which is conducted by infratest-dimap, Alice Weidel came in fifth\u00a0when it comes to satisfaction with the work of various candidates.\nOnly 20% of respondents said they were satisfied with Alice Weidel as a candidate for chancellor. She was behind Robert Habeck, the chancellor candidate for the Greens on\u00a028%, the CDU's Friedrich Merz on\u00a025%, Sarah Wagenknecht, with her own new eponymous party BSW on\u00a021%,\u00a0and the pro-business FDP's Christian Lindner also on\u00a021%.\nOlaf Scholz, the incumbent German chancellor from the center-left SPD, ranked similarly to Weidel, although other polls have shown her ahead of Merz and Scholz. Nevertheless, most polls do not show Weidel with a chance of winning the German election.\nSeveral of the questions Weidel put to Musk in the final minutes of the conversation pertained to his stated desire to colonize Mars.\nHe initially ducked the question of when he hoped for a first crewed mission to the Red Planet, but said \"it is just a matter of time before we are annihilated\" if humanity does not become a \"multi-planetary species.\"\nMusk later said the next window for a mission would be in roughly two years, adding that this window might be viable for an uncrewed mission.\nWeidel also asked Musk if he believed in God, following up on comments he'd made about how the elements making up human bodies ultimately hail from stars that exploded billions of years ago. She asked if he believed it was possible for this to be a coincidence.\nNeither of the speakers went on to offer a firm position themselves. Musk said he was \"open to the idea\" of \"some entity that you could call God,\" but less so on one \"observing our daily actions and rendering a verdict day-to-day.\" Weidel, meanwhile, said \"I'm still on a search\" and \"I don't know what to believe,\" saying she was \"agnostic maybe.\"\n\nClaim:\u00a0\"Theft is legal in California,\"\u00a0Elon Musk claimed, adding\u00a0that if stolen goods are below $1,000 (around \u20ac970), thieves allegedly won't be prosecuted.\nThe facts: Theft is not legal in California, as\u00a0can be seen for example in this press release by the Governor of the state reporting about a statewide enforcement operation targeting organized retail theft crime.\nThe claim, which has previously been stated by\u00a0Donald Trump, refers to Proposition 47, a significant criminal justice reform approved by California voters in 2014, aimed to reduce penalties for certain theft and drug possession offenses.\nUnder Proposition 47, which was passed in 2014, theft of goods valued at $950 or less is classified as a misdemeanor, not a felony. This reclassification was part of a broader criminal justice reform effort aimed at reducing prison overcrowding. However, theft under $950 is still illegal and punishable by up to six months in jail and fines up to $1,000.\nProposition 47 did not decriminalize theft but changed how crimes are prosecuted. The law eliminated the discretion of prosecutors to charge theft under $950 as a felony, except in cases involving repeat offenders or certain aggravating circumstances.\u00a0While enforcement may be constrained in some cases due to practical considerations like jail overcrowding, law enforcement agencies and the California Highway Patrol continue to target theft, especially organized retail crime.\nFor instance, statewide operations in December continued to lead to arrests, recovery of stolen goods, and measures to deter retail theft.\nAround 40 minutes into the discussion, Musk alluded both to Germany's Nazi past and to the AfD's common categorization as a far-right party, asking Weidel to comment on this.\nShe said her party was a \"conservative\" and \"libertarian\" one unfairly branded as extreme domestically.\nThe AfD is facing investigation as a potential far-right extremist group, and unsuccessfully appealed against this process earlier in the year. Those supporting this claim will often point to the comments and actions of party leaders deemed more extreme than Weidel\u00a0 when making\u00a0their case.\nWeidel also claimed, using a trope that's rather more common in the English-speaking world than it is in Germany, that Adolf Hitler was not right-wing, but rather left-wing.\nPointing to his command economy policies and heavy state spending, as he geared Germany up for rapid rearmament and war with almost all of Europe, Weidel argued that the keyword defining Hitler and the Nazis was \"Socialist,\" not the word \"National\" that they saw fit to put in front of it when naming themselves.\nHitler himself had said at the time that he wanted to reclaim the term socialism from the \"Marxists,\" who he argued had sullied what could be a viable big-state economic policy basis.\n\nClaim: During her talks with the US billionaire Elon Musk on the social media platform X, the AfD leader Alice Weidel claimed, \"Germany is the only industrial country that unplugged the nuclear power plant.\"\nThe facts: Italy shut its nuclear plants more than three decades before Germany. Shortly after the Chernobyl disaster, a nationwide referendum was held in Italy in 1987. According to the Italian Interior Ministry's archives, nearly 80% of participants voted in favor of shutting down the country's nuclear plants. By 1990, Italy had phased out all its existing nuclear facilities. In comparison, Germany closed its last remaining nuclear plants in 2023.\nBetween 100,000 and 200,000 people tuned in for the discussion, according to X's own online statistics. An audience of around 100,000 nearer the start of the conversation cleared 200,000 just after half past the hour.\nThe opening quarter of an hour was spent in large part discussing German energy policy, after Weidel referred to former Chancellor Angela Merkel as \"Germany's first green chancellor\", seemingly in reference to her push for more renewable energy, a move that began long before Merkel's tenure.\nWeidel was critical of usage of solar and wind power, a notion Musk sought to push back against somewhat.\nShe also said that Germany's reliance on Russian gas had been exposed amid the invasion of Ukraine, and criticized the use of coal temporarily to plug gaps.\nWeidel\u00a0claimed that Merkel had \"ruined our country,\" primarily because of high migration in and since 2015.\nShe also complained about her party's public treatment in the \"mainstream media\" in Germany.\nIn a discussion you could kindly categorize as free-flowing or less kindly as unstructured, the pair\u00a0also covered topics like German schoolchildren struggling in international PISA studies, with Weidel alleging the falling German scores could be traced to topics like \"socialist gender things\" dominating time in class.\nTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video\nThe discussion between Musk and Weidel started roughly on time just after 7 p.m. German time.\nEven its\u00a0heading on Musk's X account was rather misleading for those tuning in unfamiliar with German politics.\n\"Conversation with the leading candidate to run Germany,\" the discussion was initially billed as.\nWeidel is the AfD's leading candidate to run Germany. She's also at the head of the party with a realistic chance of coming second, if a rather distant second, based on current polls.\nHowever her chances of becoming chancellor after the vote on February 23, with roughly 20% public support and nobody willing to be a coalition partner, are virtually nil barring a political earthquake.\nEven prior to Thursday evening's online discussion, the German Bundestag parliament's\u00a0administrative arm is eying it as a potential violation of campaign financing rules.\nThe Bundestagsverwaltung said on Thursday that it would monitor the discussion in case it violated rules on influencing the upcoming election or party campaign donations.\nAnalysts quoted in Thursday's papers in Germany expressed skepticism about the potential for\u00a0rule breaches emerging in these areas. They pointed to factors like\u00a0the discussion being aired without charge and also to free speech laws that would cover Musk repeating an endorsement of the AfD or Weidel.\nHowever, the Lobby Control group, which campaigns for the reduced influence of lobbyists in German and EU politics,\u00a0argues that manipulating X's algorithms to boost the discussion's prominence and reach could constitute an illegal campaign donation.\nAurel Eschmann from Lobby Control told DW that Musk's account's \"reach is much higher than for a user with a similar follower count that isn't the owner of X.\"\n\"And since the\u00a0service of this boost in reach is supplied to the party AfD for free, this would constitute a party donation,\" he argued.\nA spokesperson for Weidel referred to the online event as an \"unprepared and open discussion,\" also saying that the pair had yet to meet.\nThe AfD faced a large fine for illegal campaign funding a few years ago that dated back to the 2016 state elections in Baden W\u00fcrttemberg in the southwest.\nTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video\nAs of mid-December, the far-right party was polling at nearly 20%, second among the parties, behind\u00a0the conservative CDU. That's nearly double its 2021 general election result.\nThe AfD has poached voters from all the other major parties except the Greens, and has simultaneously succeeded in mobilizing many non-voters.\nThe party scores best among middle-income to low-income earners \u2014\u00a0though that is by no means its exclusive voter base, and draws voters from across social classes. It is especially successful in Germany's east. Its membership, meanwhile, has one significant feature \u2014\u00a0only 17%\u00a0are women.\nFounded in\u00a02013\u00a0as a euroskeptic party,\u00a0the AfD has since risen to\u00a0the federal as well as every state parliament\u00a0in regional elections as well as the European parliament.\nIt was originally created by a group of neo-liberal academics as a protest against the single European currency. They were\u00a0angered specifically\u00a0by then-Chancellor Angela Merkel's decision to bail out Greece in 2010 following Europe's financial crisis.\nBut following Germany's move to welcome refugees mainly from war-torn Syria in 2015, the party\u00a0set an\u00a0overtly nationalist, anti-immigrant, anti-Islam agenda.\nRead more on Germamy's political parties.\nAlice Weidel belongs to a very small minority. She is one of nine women in the parliamentary group of the AfD\u00a0\u2014\u00a069 men make up the rest.\nShe co-chairs both the party itself and its parliamentary group, together with Tino Chrupalla. Weidel also ran on a joint ticket with Chrupalla in the last federal election\u00a0in 2021. The result back then was disappointing for the AfD: they won 10.3%, down from 12.6% in 2017.\nThe\u00a045-year-old\u00a0has a doctorate in economics.\u00a0In the late 2000s, she worked at the Bank of China\u00a0and lived in China for six years where she learned to speak Mandarin.\nWeidel has previously expressed admiration\u00a0of Margaret Thatcher, Britain's prime minister from 1979 to 1990.\nHer private life has been used by Musk to dismiss the far-right label of the AfD, as she\u00a0lives in a civil partnership with a woman who originally comes from Sri Lanka. Together, they have two adopted children.\nThat lifestyle is\u00a0a far cry from the AfD's ideals. In the party's manifesto, the party is committed to the model of the traditional family, one in which\u00a0\"mother and father take permanent joint responsibility for their children.\"\nThe AfD's candidate for chancellor lives in Germany and Switzerland. Read more on her political views.\nManfred Weber, leader of the EPP conservative bloc in the European Parliament, has told DW that it is not in Elon Musk's business interests to support Germany's far-right AfD.\nHe also said Germany and Europe should be more self-confident, and not take everything the Tesla and\u00a0SpaceX founder says \"too seriously.\"\nTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video",

One survey spread by supporters of the far-right\u00a0Alternative for Germany (AfD)\u00a0went viral with more\u00a0than 370,000 views on TikTok. DW fact-checked the claim made in the posts.\nClaim: The poll\u00a0in this TikTok video allegedly shows\u00a0a current survey (December 16), which indicates that most respondents in Germany would vote for the AfD\u00a0in the upcoming\u00a0federal\u00a0elections, locally known as the Bundestagswahl.\nDW Fact check: False.\nThe TikTok video was posted by\u00a0a pro-AfD account with more than 20,000 followers. The video shows a photo of Alice Weidel, AfD's leading candidate for chancellor, and beneath it a survey, allegedly from December 16, 2024. The survey claims that 28 percent of respondents would vote for AfD, while 25 percent would vote for the Social Democratic Party (SPD), 16 percent for the Christian Democratic Union (CDU), and 14 percent for the left-wing Sarah Wagenknecht Alliance (BSW).\nHowever, the poll has no connection to the upcoming federal elections and is not current either. The figures come from the Institute for New Social Answers (INSA), a German institute\u00a0that conducts political and\u00a0market research,\u00a0and are related to the Brandenburg state election in September 2024. It was first published on September 17, 2024, before the Brandenburg state election.\nThe screenshot shown in the TikTok video was taken from a Facebook post of\u00a0the German private media outletRTL. The source and original date\u00a0were cropped out\u00a0in the TikTok video.\nAccording to the latest INSA poll results for the German federal election on December 16, 2024, 31.5% of respondents would vote for the CDU, while 19.5% would vote for the AfD\u00a0and 16.5% would vote for the SPD.\nEdited by:\u00a0Rachel Baig",

A significant concern is the potential return of Donald Trump as U.S. president, which could disrupt transatlantic relations and impact support for Ukraine. German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock affirmed Germany's commitment to Ukraine, while experts suggest Germany may need to increase military spending amid security threats. Additionally, the situation in the Middle East, including the aftermath of the Hamas attack on Israel, adds complexity to Germany's foreign policy. Public opinion shows mixed support for a more active German role in global security.",
            "content": "Germany will hold new federal elections in February 2025. But regardless of who leads the next government, foreign policy will remain challenging.\nIt seems likely that Germany's biggest foreign policy challenge in 2025 will stem from the next US president, Donald Trump. He is expected to oppose much of what was prioritized by\u00a0Chancellor Olaf Scholzand his recently ruptured center-left coalition government.\n\"It is now clear that the old formula \u2014 that we can rely on the US to safeguard our security \u2014 no longer applies,\" Thorsten Benner, director of the Global Public Policy Institute (GPPI) in Berlin, told DW.\u00a0\"Trump is the new rule \u2014 and four years under Biden were the last twitches of the old transatlanticism.\"\nAs a consequence, Germany must prepare for a world \"in which we have to pay much more for our own security in Europe, and to do that while there is a war\u00a0on the European continent,\" Brenner added.\nTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video\nNext year's foreign policy shifts may well be most obvious in the way they affect\u00a0the war in Ukraine. Trump recently reiterated that he would \"certainly\" cut support to Ukraine \u2014 and called for an \"immediate ceasefire.\"\nWhat would that mean for Germany? Foreign Minister\u00a0Annalena Baerbock of the Greens, set out some of the country's positions at the Berlin Foreign Policy Forum\u00a0in mid-November: \"Germany stands by Ukraine, irrespective of the US election results,\" she said, adding that \"there can be no peace negotiations over Ukrainian heads.\" With that statement, Baerbock was responding to Trump's hints that he could end the war in Ukraine through direct talks with Russian President Vladimir Putin.\nTo avoid that scenario, Benner believes Germany should \"approach the Trump administration with an offer.\" One possibility might be: \"We will pay you to continue to supply\u00a0military goods to Ukraine.\" Europe simply doesn't have the manufacturing capacity to supply\u00a0the same level of military aid to Ukraine that the US has \u2014 but it could finance it.\nBenner is convinced that Germany must increase its spending on Ukraine, as well as on general security. However, given Germany's tight budget, it could only do so by taking on new debt.\nThe second major foreign policy challenge is the Middle East. The ousting of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad by rebel groups in early December has greatly complicated the situation there. While Syrians are celebrating the end of Assad's rule, which was supported by Russia and Iran, Germany is still waiting to see whether Islamists will enforce religious rule in Syria, which could trigger new streams of refugees coming to Europe. But the upheaval in Syria is only one event, albeit the most recent, in the Middle East.\nFollowing the Hamas terrorist attack on Israel on October 7, 2023, the subsequent retaliation by Israel in the Gaza Strip, and its fight against Hezbollah in southern Lebanon, Germany has been attempting a balancing act.\nTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video\nOn the one hand, it has supplied Israel with weapons\u00a0on the basis of what Germany calls a \"reason of state.\" On the other, in numerous trips to the region, Baerbock has advocated for Palestinians and de-escalation.\n\"The balancing act was not perfect, but doing it any other way than it has been done so far\u00a0would have been difficult,\" said Hans-Jakob Schindler, Middle East expert at the Counter Extremism Project (CEP).\nThe entire European Union substantially reduced its involvement in the Middle East conflict many years ago, and\u00a0Schindler notes that since October 7, the EU and Germany have had \"hardly any weight in the talks, when it came to the decisions.\" \"So it was really an American-Israeli dialogue, and the Europeans were \u2014 at most \u2014 spectators, offering comments from the sidelines,\" he told DW.\nWith Trump as\u00a0US president, the question is: \"How will he reconcile his very pro-Israeli position with his goal of ending conflicts?\"\nSchindler is convinced that \"Germany and Europe will not develop any kind of stronger position that might influence the conflict.\" He believes that only\u00a0in the best case scenario \u2014 some future reconstruction in the Gaza Strip and southern Lebanon \u2014 may Europe be able to\u00a0reassert itself\u00a0by becoming actively involved.\nFor three years, Baerbock has been Germany's primary foreign policy figure \u2014 and has occasionally tried to champion\u00a0human rights, openly addressing\u00a0human rights violations with important trading partners like China.\nHowever, during a 2023 press conference with then-Chinese Foreign Minister Qin Gang, he responded by saying, \"What China needs least of all is a teacher from the West.\"\nThorsten Benner says that values-based foreign policies are difficult to implement. \"Of course, it's good to have an ambitious target \u2014 to avoid falling into overly complicated realpolitik compromises too easily. But I believe even Ms. Baerbock herself, in any future German coalition, might no longer wish to anchor a values-based foreign policy in the same way,\" he said.\nTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video\nOpinion polls suggest that\u00a0the next German government will most likely be led by the Christian Democratic Union (CDU)\u00a0and its Bavarian sister-party the\u00a0Christian Social Union (CSU), under a Chancellor Friedrich Merz. Henning Hoff of the German Council on Foreign Relations (DGAP), believes a Merz-led foreign policy won't actually be that different from Germany's current one. \"There's a consensus on foreign policy that we have in Germany. This is a stabilizing factor during this time of crisis,\" Hoff told DW. That consensus holds that the country must become more active in foreign and security policy.\nThe German population, however, is not fully on board with this. In a survey commissioned by the K\u00f6rber Foundation right after the US election \u2014 and shortly after Scholz's coalition collapsed \u2014 73% of respondents said Germany should invest more in European security. However, 58% were against Germany taking on a leading role in the West, should the US withdraw from the international stage.\nAs far as NATO is concerned, a YouGov survey conducted in mid-November after Trump's election showed that only 33% of Germans felt their country should play a greater role in NATO leadership. Another 41% wanted it to play an equally strong role, and 16% wanted it to play a lesser role.\nIt seems that any new German government, no matter who leads it, will also face a challenge on the domestic front: Convincing Germans that their country should assume more global responsibility.\nThis article was originally written in German.\nWhile you're here: Every Tuesday, DW editors round up what is happening in German politics and society.

            "content": "Germany's domestic policy in 2025 will likely focus on controlling immigration, fending off cyber-attacks and protecting the rule of law and democratic institutions.\nThe Magdeburg Christmas market attack\u00a0\u2014 and the heated political atmosphere that took hold in Germany as a result \u2014 have\u00a0stressed how central the issues of domestic security and extremism will be for the next German government.\nBut other topics remain important as well. How does a government combat irregular immigration while boosting skilled immigration? And how does it safeguard against cyberattacks, uphold the rule of law and strengthen democracy against enemies within and without? These are some of the major challenges that the next German government will face in 2025, regardless of which party will be at the helm.\nAnd yet, if you ask some Bundestag members, all of these challenges must first be pushed to the sidelines\u00a0to address the crisis facing the country's economy. Flagship German companies like Volkswagen are in deep trouble, people are worried about their jobs and are struggling with rising prices and rents.\nMarco Wanderwitz of the center-right Christian Democrats (CDU) was the federal commissioner for the eastern German states until 2021, and told DW: \"The biggest problem we have in this country right now is that our economy is stuttering. And that is really affecting the foundations and the future. The big problem is that we have a loss of confidence in politics among economic leaders.\"\nTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video\nThe government is being blamed for high energy prices, high wage levels, the deterioration of infrastructure, a shortage of skilled workers and too much bureaucracy.\nAccording to Omid Nouripour, former leader of the Green Party, the last point in particular is showcased by the country's sluggish digitalization.\n\"We have a twofold crisis, both economically and structurally,\" he told DW. \"You can see this, for example, in government offices, where fax machines are still considered a top means of communication. And you can see that in the investment backlog in this country.\"\nThese problems are exacerbated by external cyber-attacks, many from Russia, on infrastructure such as the country's power grids. \"The most important thing is to protect critical infrastructure,\" Nouripour said. \"We have too many vulnerabilities in this area. And there are too many players putting pressure on critical infrastructure.\"\nThis is why strengthening the police and intelligence services is an important task\u00a0for the coming year.\nTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video\nTwo other issues that have long been identified as problems will pose a far greater challenge for a future government than they have so far: Immigration and the question of how the country should deal with the apparent rise of populism and far-right extremism.\u00a0The Christmas market attack in Magdeburg highlighted this problem.\nBoth the number of applications for asylum and the estimated number of irregular immigrants have actually gone down in recent years, even though the European border protection agency Frontex estimates that around 166,000 people attempted to enter the EU irregularly in the first nine months of 2024.\nGermany has reintroduced controls at all its borders, and the conservative CDU, which has a good chance of leading the next government after the February election, has now come out in favor of turning back refugees at the borders.\nMany local authorities say they have reached their limit when it comes to receiving and caring for refugees. Stefan Seidler from the S\u00fcdschleswigscher W\u00e4hlerverband (SSW), a party representing Germany's Frisian and Danish minority in the north of the country, says he has seen this first-hand.\n\"What I can say from my perspective is that the municipalities are currently facing a huge task that they can hardly cope with,\" he told DW. \"What they need is support from the federal government.\"\nWanderwitz, who is not running as a candidate for the Bundestag again, begs to differ. He believes immigration is manageable, though he knows how polarizing the issue is. \"The numbers have gone down,\" he explained, and he feels the problems have been exaggerated. \"I actually only know local politicians who say it's much less bad than in 2014 or 2015. But despite this, everyone has somehow raised the white flag,\" Wanderwitz said.\nNouripour believes the number of refugees heading to Germany may rise again. \"We know that the situation in Ukraine could lead to more refugees, and we can see that one conflict or another could escalate further in the Middle East,\" he cautioned.\nTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video\nMeanwhile, the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) is expected to make gains in February's election.\n\"We are currently experiencing massive pressure from the far right,\" Seidler warned. He is concerned about safeguarding the rights of minorities. \"We are currently seeing those gain momentum who think that it is the majority alone who decides. But as a minority politician, I can only say clearly and unequivocally: A good democracy also shows consideration for its minorities.\"\nThis is part of the reason why Seidler supported a motion tabled in the Bundestag by the opposition CDU/CSU bloc, the center-left Social Democrats (SPD) and\u00a0Greens currently forming a minority government and their former coalition partner, the neoliberal Free Democrats (FDP) to protect the independence of the Federal Constitutional Court against political interference. The reform raises the bar to alter the rules of the court, one thing that could be agreed on by the required two-thirds majority in the German parliament \u2014 even at a time of fierce election campaigning.\nAll politicians agree that 2025 will be another tough year, with fierce disputes and many crises to solve.\nThis article was originally written in German.\nWhile you're here: Every Tuesday, DW editors round up what is happening in German politics and society.

But he added that it would take more than one legislative period to close the gap on 30 years of underfunding.\nOn Wednesday, the German Navy got key approval to expand its fleet with an order for four more advanced\u00a0submarines, in a deal with\u00a0ThyssenKrupp Marine Systems (TKMS) costing about \u20ac4.7 billion.\nAlso this week, Pistorius said Berlin plans to\u00a0increase the size of its armed forces to 230,000, up from the current target of 203,000.\nHowever,\u00a0the minister told Funke newspapers that Germany's defense sector \"needs time to ramp up production capacities to produce weapons and ammunition,\" as the production of tanks, frigates and submarines can take several years.\nSeparately, a poll for Bild am Sonntag newspaper placed\u00a0Pistorius up top in an annual ranking of German politicians.\nAround\u00a046% of those surveyed by Insa said they thought\u00a0the defense minister\u00a0should have as much influence as possible in German politics next year.\nBavaria's conservative state Premier\u00a0Markus S\u00f6der (CSU) scored 38% on the same question, while Scholz was beaten into sixth place with 28% support.\nScholz came in\u00a0behind\u00a0BSW chief\u00a0Wagenknecht, center-right\u00a0CDU leader Friedrich Merz and AfD co-chair\u00a0Alice Weidel.\nmm/sms (dpa, Reuters)",

A man taken into custody at the scene is reportedly a critic of Islam and AfD supporter.\nAfter the deadly December 20 attack on a Christmas market in Magdeburg, a suspect was arrested almost immediately.\nOn the evening of the attack, Saxony-Anhalt's state premier, Reiner Haseloff, said the suspect was a 50-year-old man from Saudi Arabia who had been living in Germany for 18 years and had likely acted alone when he drove through the crowds.\nSeveral German media outlets quickly identified the man as Talib A.* and reported that he was a specialist in psychiatry and psychotherapy. Talib A. was practicing in Bernburg, about 40 kilometers (25 miles) south of Magdeburg, where the attack happened.\nThe Saudi native was raised a Muslim but left his religion\u00a0and became an active critic of Islam and its treatment of women, particularly in his homeland.\nDescribing himself as a former Muslim and a Saudi dissident, he was an enthusiastic user of the social media platform X (formerly Twitter). He had around 47,000 followers there.\nThere he posted or re-posted daily mostly on anti-Islam themes. He often criticized the religion and congratulated Muslims who left the faith.\nAccording to an interview he did with the BBC in 2022, Talib A. set up a website called \"We Are Saudis\" (wearesaudis.net) which he says he used to help Saudi activists and ex-Muslims escape Saudi Arabia and other Gulf countries. He told the BBC he was often approached by younger Saudi women trying to escape\u00a0their families.\nHowever the UK's Daily Telegraph reports that some other dissidents found him too intense and avoided him.\nHis views veered into Islamophobia and he frequently posted content echoing far-right rhetoric. He often criticized Germany's migration policy because he claimed it had allowed too many Muslims into the country and blamed Angela Merkel, Germany's former chancellor, for allegedly allowing that to happen.\nIn December, he shared a video about Afghan women being banned from medical universities by the Taliban and commented that, \"had Merkel achieved her plan, this would have been Germany right now.\"\nThe same day he also posted that, \"Merkel must spend the rest of her life in prison as punishment for her criminal secret project to Islamize Europe. But if the death penalty is reinstated, she deserves to be executed.\"\nThis support for the far right and his concerns about Islam in Europe date back to at least 2016.\nHe became increasingly upset with Germany. \"I have to admit that I was deceived by western Leftists,\" he wrote in another post on X. \"I thought they welcome refugees because they care for human rights. But my experience in Germany showed me that they welcome refugees because they want to Islamise Europe.\u201d\nTaleb A. was also supportive of\u00a0Germany's far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) party.\u00a0\"The AfD and I are fighting the same enemy,\" he wrote on social media.\nHe also praised far-right figures like the Netherlands' Geert Wilders and UK extremist Tommy Robinson, as well as\u00a0X owner, billionaire Elon Musk.\nTalib A. actively sought media exposure for his cause. In 2019, he and the website were featured in media reports across Germany, the UK and other countries, including the Frankfurter Allgemeine newspaper.\u00a0Talib A. had also been in contact with Deutsche Welle. DW has released this statement about that contact:\n\"Talib A., the alleged perpetrator of the Christmas Market attack in Magdeburg, was in contact with DW.\nIn March 2021, the 50-year-old doctor from Saudi Arabia reached out through Twitter. He accused Saudi Arabia and Saudis in Germany of spying on him. He also accused the German authorities of not taking him seriously and not taking any action.\nIn a message to DW in October 2023, he wrote: \"They refused to even open an investigation! On the grounds that there is no public interest. [\u2026] They leave a Saudi refugee exposed to intimidation, surveillance and persecution without even conducting an hour-long investigation to get at least a first impression.\"\nHowever, many of his claims could not be independently verified by DW.\nIn November and December 2024, he offered to appear on DW and publicly present evidence. After receiving no reply, he broke off contact.\"\nOnly a few days before the Magdeburg attack, he gave an interview to the RAIR Foundation, a website known for featuring vaccine-skeptical and anti-Muslim content.\nAlthough the RAIR Foundation later replaced the December 12 interview with a completely different text, archived versions of the site show that he gave another similar interview.\n\"Germany \u2014 and much of the West \u2014 is not only facilitating the Islamization of their societies but is actively persecuting legitimate refugees fleeing Sharia oppression,\" he claimed in the interview. \u00a0He also alleged that Germany was \"waging war on ex-Muslims.\"\nOn his personal X account, he claimed he had evidence of German authorities committing \"a series of deliberate crimes against Saudi refugees.\"\n\"I assure you that if Germany wants a war, we will fight it,\" he wrote in one post \"If Germany wants to kill us, we will slaughter them, die, or go to prison with pride.\"\nDespite Talib A.\u2019s various posts and his increasingly extreme political opinions, German authorities have yet to release information as to what they think his motive was in driving into the Magdeburg Christmas market.\n\"We can only say with certainty that the perpetrator was obviously Islamophobic,\" Germany's Interior Minister Nancy Faeser told reporters on Saturday.\nThere have been a number of similar incidents with vehicles in Germany over recent years. The best-known is likely a terrorist attack on a Berlin Christmas market\u00a0on December 19, 2016, by Islamist extremist Anis Amri. In that dozens of people were injured and 13 died. Amri was apparently motivated by calls from the extremist \"Islamic State\" group to carry out low-cost attacks on the West.\nBut other attacks were linked to mental illness and\u00a0far-right extremism.\nIn 2022, a mentally ill man drove into a busy shopping street in Berlin, killing one person. In 2020, another man drove into a crowd celebrating in the small town of Volkmarsen\u00a0in the state of Hesse. His motivation has never been clarified as he refused to speak to investigators.\n*Editor's note: DW follows the German press code, which stresses the importance of protecting the privacy of suspected criminals or victims and urges us to refrain from revealing the full names of alleged criminals.\nThis story was updated on December 21.\nTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video",

The perpetrator, a doctor from Saudi Arabia, is currently in pre-trial detention, facing charges of murder, attempted murder, and dangerous bodily harm.\nInvestigators are examining reports that there had been warnings about a potential threat from the perpetrator.\nIn the first opinion poll to be released after the Magdeburg attack, Germany\u2019s political landscape looks largely unchanged ahead of February's election.\nAccording to the poll, published by the\u00a0tabloid Bild newspaper and conducted by German polling institute INSA, the conservative CDU/CSU is still the biggest political force, garnering 31%\u00a0voter support and losing half a percentage point from the previous INSA survey.\nThe far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) maintained its position as the second most-popular party, with 19.5% support.\nThe\u00a0Social Democratic Party (SPD), would receive 16% of the vote, having lost half a percentage point from the previous INSA poll.\u00a0Germany\u2019s environmentalist Greens gained one point and now have 12.5% backing.\nThe left-wing populist Sahra Wagenknecht Alliance (BSW) remain at 8%.\nThe business-friendly Free Democrats (FDP) are at 5%, which is the exact threshold to enter the German parliament, or Bundestag.\u00a0The Left Party, meanwhile,\u00a0are still under that\u00a0threshold with 3% support.\nGerman investigators found a will left in the car used by the perpetrator of Friday night's attack on the Magdeburg Christmas Market, according to Germany's Der\u00a0Spiegel news magazine.\nIn the will, the attacker, who presumably expected to die during the attack, states that his entire fortune should be donated to the German Red Cross.\nIn May 2024, he had posted on \"X\" that he expected to die \"this year,\" a warning which he repeated in several private messages to other \"X\" users, reports Spiegel.\nThe will and testament reportedly did not contain any political messages.\nHundreds of people formed a human chain around the Alter Markt in Magdeburg on Monday evening in a gesture of remembrance for the victims of Friday night's attack on a Christmas market held on the same square.\nThe initiative, named \"Don't Give Hate a Chance,\" was also intended to be a stand against right-wing extremists seeking to exploit the attack for political gain.\nOrganizers said thousands took part, with people of all ages standing together in dense crowds. Holding candles, they applauded and thanked the emergency services \u2014\u00a0the police officers who had apprehended the perpetrator and the medical teams who had treated the over 200 wounded.\n\"These are lights for a cosmopolitan city,\" said Oliver Wiebe, one of the organizers.\nThe event took place at the same time as a demonstration led by the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) party on the Domplatz just across town, where attendees had chanted for \"deportations!\"\nLocal newspapers in Magdeburg and the surrounding areas of eastern Germany have warned against what they consider the \"instrumentalization\" of Friday night's attack while calling\u00a0on the authorities to investigate security failures thoroughly.\nIn Magdeburg itself, the local Volksstimme newspaper wrote:\n\"Three days on from the attack, and despite all appeals to the contrary, the political instrumentalization has begun. The right has blamed all migrants for the crime, while the left says it was the result of far-right radicalization. With the federal election coming up [in February], it's a battle for control of the narrative. In the end, it will lead to little \u2014\u00a0only to a further division of society. After all, the profile of the perpetrator can be interpreted in several ways.\n\"But that doesn't mean that [the attack] doesn't require investigation. Because, when people lose trust in the state's ability to protect them, the political center and ultimately democracy itself are endangered. We saw what that means on Saturday when groups of far-right demonstrators using sinister language could be observed.\"\nAnd in Cottbus, a city in the neighboring state of Brandenburg,the Lausitzer Rundschau newspaper wrote:\n\"One need not only look at the demonstrations by right-wing extremists to see that many more protagonists will be looking to score political points in relation to this attack. The CDU [Christian Democratic Union] wants to start turning [migrants] back at the borders again. But what does that have to do with the terror in Magdeburg? The terrorist arrived here legally, lived here legally, worked here legally \u00a0and evidently fell into madness here.\n\"As correct as it is to investigate the precise circumstances of this terrible crime and the security failures before it, the political instrumentalization is equally disingenuous. Regardless of who is doing it.\"\nGermany's far-right populist Alternative for Germany (AfD) party staged a demonstration on Magdeburg's central Domplatz on Monday evening in response to Friday night's deadly Christmas market attack.\nPrecise attendance figures were not immediately available, but footage appeared showed many people on the square listening to speeches made by AfD politicians, including chancellor candidate Alice Weidel and Jan Wenzel Schmidt, the AfD's leader for the state of Saxony-Anhalt.\n\"Someone who hates \u2014\u00a0and kills \u2014\u00a0the people of the country that gave him asylum, who hates all we stand for and all that we love, does not belong to us,\" said Weidel, who had traveled to Magdeburg from Berlin.\n\"We want things to finally change in this country so that we will never again have to mourn with the mother who has lost her son in such a pointless and brutal way,\" she continued, describing the attack as \"an act of an Islamist full of hatred for what constitutes human cohesion ... for us Germans, for us Christians.\"\nThe perpetrator of the Christmas market attack is a Saudi man who came to Germany in 2006. In social media posts, he called himself an atheist who renounced Islam and attacked German migration policies as too lenient. He also expressed sympathy for the AfD, saying it pursued the same goals he did.\nWenzel Schmidt called the attack a \"monstrous political failure\" on the part of the authorities who had granted the \"mass murderer\" asylum despite him having publicized his intentions (see entries below). Individual police officers, he said, had had their \"hands tied\" and been \"left alone\" by their superiors.\nDuring the demonstration, which was titled \"Grief unites \u2014 for a secure future,\" attendees intermittently chanted for \"deportations.\"\nAfter the speeches, the AfD is set to lead a march around the city center.\nSimultaneously, several counter-demonstrations took place with slogans such as \"We want to mourn \u2014\u00a0give hate no chance\" and \"Give fascism no chance.\"\nState police in Saxony-Anhalt\u00a0received a warning regarding the perpetrator of Friday night's Christmas market attack back in autumn 2023, but they didn't respond, local public broadcaster MDR reports.\nOn September 27, 2023, a member of the public contacted the police via direct message on Instagram, writing in English: \"There's a guy [who] said he's going to kill random German citizens, please do something and arrest him as soon as possible. Please answer, it's very urgent.\"\nThe warning also featured screenshots of posts made by the eventual perpetrator on \"X.\"\nAccording to MDR, the tipster had also contacted Germany's Federal Office for Migration and Refugees (BAMF) and police in Berlin, both of which had directed them to police in Saxony-Anhalt.\nAcknowledging the warning, BAMF said on Monday: \"This tip, like many others, was taken seriously. But since we are not an investigative authority, the person giving the warning was, as is always the case, referred directly to the responsible authorities.\"\nSaxony-Anhalt state police told MDR that they were unable to comment due to the ongoing investigation.\nGerman police contacted the perpetrator of Friday night's deadly attack in Magdeburg several times in the past year in order to conduct so-called preventative appeals.\nAccording to Saxony-Anhalt\u00a0Interior Minister\u00a0Tamara Zieschang, a first appeal took place in September 2023 and another in October 2024.\nPolice also attempted to conduct a preventative appeal in December 2023 regarding comments the perpetrator had made on social media. However, they were unable to confront him in person, a written appeal went unanswered and the investigation was dropped.\nProsecutors said the number of injured in the Magdeburg Christmas market attack\u00a0has risen to as many as 235 as more people have reported to hospitals and doctors.\nIt is, however, possible\u00a0there was some double-counting of the figures.\nTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video\n\nGermany's leading opposition party, the Christian Democratic Union (CDU), has called for the country's intelligence services to be strengthened after the attack in Magdeburg.\n\"We can no longer be satisfied with the fact that information about violent criminals and terrorists often only comes from foreign services,\" CDU lawmaker G\u00fcnter Krings the Handelsblatt newspaper. \"That is why our German security authorities need more powers of their own in order to gain more of their own knowledge, especially in the digital area.\"\nSaudi Arabia has previously requested the extradition of the attacker from Germany, a government source told the AFP news agency on Monday.\n\"There was [an extradition]\u00a0request,\" said the source, without giving the reason for the request, adding that Riyadh had warned he \"could be dangerous.\"\nThe CDU's Krings said security services must be able to remove dangerous people from society using information from their digital activities.\nThe German state of Saxony-Anhalt, of which Magdeburg is the capital, is offering psychological counseling to schoolchildren and educational staff who were caught up in the attack.\nHotlines are being set up on which the state's Education Ministry said \"those affected can use the hotlines to talk confidentially about their own feelings and fears.\"\nState Education Minister Eva Feussner said the attack had deeply affected the community.\n\"In addition to compassion for the victims and their families, it is also very important to support those seeking help and to support them in their healing process,\" said Feussner.\n\"We want to ensure that no one has to deal with the emotional stress of this tragedy alone. We stand together in this difficult time and will do everything we can to offer our children and the state's school staff the support they need.\"\nGerman Interior Minister Nancy Faeser and the heads of Germany's domestic and foreign intelligence services are due to answer questions about the Magdeburg Christmas market attack at a parliamentary committee next week, a senior lawmaker said.\nDirk Wiese, a member of Chancellor Olaf Scholz's Social Democrats, told the AFP news agency that officials from Germany's domestic and foreign intelligence agencies and the Office for Migration and Refugees had been called to a hearing on December 30.\nThere are unanswered questions about what the authorities knew about the perpetrator before Friday's attack.\nGermany's Federal Criminal Police (BKA) President Holger M\u00fcnch told public broadcaster ZDF the man had various contacts with authorities, during which he made insults and sometimes threats, but he was not known to be violent.\nM\u00fcnch described him as an \"atypical perpetrator.\"\nGermany's Federal Office for Migration and Refugees also acknowledged Sunday it had received a warning about the suspect last year.\nTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video\nA man who threatened severe criminal acts at Bremerhaven's Christmas market in a TikTok video was detained on Sunday night, police said.\nPolice in the German port city \"very quickly\"\u00a0 identified the suspect after the video was posted and took him into custody.\nThere are no details about the suspect or the specific threats made.\nPolice said there was no danger to the public.\nRead more about it here.\nGermany's far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) is set to hold a rally in Magdeburg on Monday evening.\nThe party's chancellor candidate, Alice Weidel, and several state AfD politicians are expected to attend the gathering at the city's Domplatz, followed by a march.\nIn an invitation to the event, the AfD claimed that the recent attack highlights the dangers of Germany's immigration policy.\nOn Saturday, scuffles broke out at a far-right rally in the city, billed as a \"demonstration against terror\" and attended by more than 2,000 people.\nProtesters held up a large banner bearing the word \"immigration,\"\u00a0a term popular with anti-immigration extremists seeking the mass deportation of migrants.\nTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video\nGerman Interior Minister Nancy Faeser has urged the swift adoption of draft laws to bolster internal security.\nThe deadly attack on a Christmas market in Magdeburg has raised questions about public safety and intelligence gaps in Germany.\n\"We must do everything in our power to protect the people of Germany from such horrific acts of violence. Our security authorities need all the necessary powers and additional personnel to achieve this,\" Faeser told Der Spiegel news magazine.\nFollowing the\u00a0Solingen knife attack\u00a0earlier this year, lawmakers tightened gun laws and strengthened security authorities' powers.\nFaeser, however, said further legislative changes were blocked by her Social Democratic Party (SPD) party's former governing coalition partner, the Free Democrats (FDP), the opposition Christian Democrats (CDU) and the CDU's Bavarian sister party, the Christian Social Union (CSU).\n\"All of these bills could be passed immediately if the [CDU and CSU] and FDP did not refuse to do so,\" she said.\nThe measures include\u00a0a new Federal Police Act, designed to strengthen the federal police, and the introduction of biometric surveillance.\nFDP General Secretary Marco Buschmann cautioned against hasty\u00a0actions.\n\"Our task is to support the victims and their families. Competing for symbolic measures would not do justice to the terrible situation,\" he told Der Spiegel.\nGermany will hold a federal election in February. Domestic security is likely to be an important issue in the campaign.\nBernd Baumann, the parliamentary head of the far-right AfD, called on Chancellor Olaf Scholz to convene a special session of the Bundestag regarding the \"desolate\" security situation, stating that \"this is the least we owe to the victims.\"\nMeanwhile, the head of the far-left BSW party, Sahra Wagenknecht, demanded Faeser explain \"why so many tips and warnings were ignored beforehand.\"\nThe CDU\u00a0and FDP called for enhancements to Germany's security apparatus, including improved coordination between federal and state authorities.\nTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video\nlo/rm\u00a0(AP, AFP, dpa, Reuters)",

            "content": "Authorities have reported a surge in racist attacks following the deadly Christmas market attack in Magdeburg, eastern Germany. The country's far-right is instrumentalizing the incident to stoke fear and hatred.\nThe motive of Talib A.*, the suspected perpetrator of the deadly Christmas Market attack in Magdeburg, is still unclear. What has been confirmed\u00a0is that he is a Saudi citizen and that he is in custody.\nNevertheless, shortly after the attack, the extreme-right scene in Germany began to antagonize migrants.\n\"I have never experienced such a hostile and threatening environment,\" said a student studying automotive engineering in Magdeburg, the capital of the eastern state of\u00a0Saxony-Anhalt.\nSalam, a violence prevention center in Saxony-Anhalt, gave a similar account. The association has observed a significant increase in incidents against people seen as foreigners by right-wing extremists.\nTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video\nAccording to Salam, \"perceived migrants are branded as 'terrorists,' 'criminals' and 'lowlifes,' some are pushed around and spat at.\"\nThreats have gone so far that migrant communities have warned each other in WhatsApp groups and on Facebook against going out in public.\nThat the perpetrator of the Magdeburg attack is suspected of being an Islamophobe and a right-wing extremist is a paradox, Hans Goldenbaum, a radicalization expert at Salam, told German broadcaster MDR. \"It shows the power of this right extreme discourse and how sealed off he is from reality.\"\nSince the Christmas market attack on December 20, extreme-right\u00a0and neo-Nazi parties, associations and individuals have mobilized across Germany,\u00a0demanding the mass deportation of migrants.\nHundreds of neo-Nazis gathered at an extreme-right\u00a0rally in Magdeburg on December 22, two days after the attack. The demonstration saw aggression against journalists.\nOne of the speakers at a rally on Sunday was Thorsten Heise. A\u00a0militant neo-Nazi with several previous convictions, he once tried to run over a refugee with his car. Videos of the rally show Heise calling on the demonstrators to infiltrate associations, fire departments and authorities.\nJournalists and observers reported that participants in the rally shouted \"Wake up Germany,\" a phrase used during Nazi Germany under Adolf Hitler. Its usage is a punishable offense in Germany.\nAccording to police estimates, up to 3,500 people \u2014 including political party leaders and known extremists from the local hooligan scene \u2014 attended a demonstration promoted by the nationalist\u00a0far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) . Clothing and tattoos common among white supremacists were visible.\nAs AfD co-leader Alice Weidel spoke, the audience chanted: \"Deport, deport, deport.\" After the demonstration, attendees took to the streets. They attacked photographers, shouted nationalist slogans and tested the strength of the accompanying police.\nDavid Begrich, a right-wing extremism expert from the association Miteinander in Magdeburg, expects a broader politicization of the Christmas market attack. The\u00a0AfD\u00a0political party has organized large demonstrations in Magdeburg. Begrich strongly criticized the demonstrations, saying the focus after the attack should remain on the five victims and the 200 others wounded.\n\"I am witnessing great bewilderment and shock in Magdeburg,\" he told DW. \"This attack has deeply wounded the city. That also applies to me personally: my wife was one of those injured.\"\nBegrich said he thinks no one should politicize the attack as long as there are victims in the hospital.\u00a0\"The fate of the victims must be the main focus,\" he said. \"The reappraisal comes afterward. Communities do not want any politicization.\"\nDespite all the fake news, speculation and attempts at politicizing the deadly attack on social media, Begrich sees his city as truly affected by the tragedy.\n\"The city is coming together,\" he said.\n*Editor's note: DW follows the German press code, which stresses the importance of protecting the privacy of suspected criminals or victims and urges us to refrain from revealing the full names of alleged criminals.\nThis article was originally written in German.\nThis article was originally published on December 23, 2024, and updated on December 24, 2024, to include details of a rally promoted by the Alternative for Germany party.",

Let's not allow ourselves to be driven apart. Let's stand together!\" he said.\nGermans are asking how the attack could have happened, when security was already heightened at Christmas markets and when authorities had clearly investigated the suspect several times in recent years.\nThe threat he posed was considered \"too unspecific\", according to one assessment, while one tip-off against him in September 2023 appears to have fallen through the cracks.\nIn another apparent security failing, the driver was also able to get through a gap that had been left open for emergency access when it should have been filled by a police van.\nStallholders at the Christmas market have now been allowed to come back, to throw away old food and remove their equipment and stocks.\nNone that I approached wanted to speak to the BBC. It's all too raw.\nThere has also been hostility towards journalists over the past few days, especially after some 2,000 people joined a protest by the far right in Magdeburg on Saturday night.\nThe Association of German Journalists said there had been aggression and threats against the press and appealed for greater police protection.\nThe BBC team joined mourners gathered in Cathedral Square for a live stream of the vigil for victims of the attack and many who spoke to them said it was important to show solidarity at a time of terrible distress.\nBut one woman struck a note of caution.

            "content": "The political fallout from the deadly attack on the Magdeburg Christmas market, which killed five people, continues. Far-right AfD and its opponents held a rally on Monday. Follow DW for more.\nAfter a driver plowed into a Christmas market in Magdeburg, Germany, killing five people, concerns have been raised about public safety and intelligence gaps.\nFive people, including a 9-year-old boy, were killed and more than\u00a0200 injured on Friday night when a car plowed into a crowd at the eastern German city's Christmas market.\nPoliticians across the spectrum, from the far-left to the far-right, are calling for enhanced security measures.\nPolice have yet to determine the motives behind Friday's attack. The perpetrator, a doctor from Saudi Arabia, is currently in pre-trial detention, facing charges of murder, attempted murder, and dangerous bodily harm.\nInvestigators are examining reports that there had been warnings about a potential threat from the perpetrator.\nIn the first opinion poll to be released after the Magdeburg attack, Germany\u2019s political landscape looks largely unchanged ahead of February's election.\nAccording to the poll, published by the\u00a0tabloid Bild newspaper and conducted by German polling institute INSA, the conservative CDU/CSU is still the biggest political force, garnering 31%\u00a0voter support and losing half a percentage point from the previous INSA survey.\nThe far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) maintained its position as the second most-popular party, with 19.5% support.\nThe\u00a0Social Democratic Party (SPD), would receive 16% of the vote, having lost half a percentage point from the previous INSA poll.\u00a0Germany\u2019s environmentalist Greens gained one point and now have 12.5% backing.\nThe left-wing populist Sahra Wagenknecht Alliance (BSW) remain at 8%.\nThe business-friendly Free Democrats (FDP) are at 5%, which is the exact threshold to enter the German parliament, or Bundestag.\u00a0The Left Party, meanwhile,\u00a0are still under that\u00a0threshold with 3% support.\nGerman investigators found a will left in the car used by the perpetrator of Friday night's attack on the Magdeburg Christmas Market, according to Germany's Der\u00a0Spiegel news magazine.\nIn the will, the attacker, who presumably expected to die during the attack, states that his entire fortune should be donated to the German Red Cross.\nIn May 2024, he had posted on \"X\" that he expected to die \"this year,\" a warning which he repeated in several private messages to other \"X\" users, reports Spiegel.\nThe will and testament reportedly did not contain any political messages.\nHundreds of people formed a human chain around the Alter Markt in Magdeburg on Monday evening in a gesture of remembrance for the victims of Friday night's attack on a Christmas market held on the same square.\nThe initiative, named \"Don't Give Hate a Chance,\" was also intended to be a stand against right-wing extremists seeking to exploit the attack for political gain.\nOrganizers said thousands took part, with people of all ages standing together in dense crowds. Holding candles, they applauded and thanked the emergency services \u2014\u00a0the police officers who had apprehended the perpetrator and the medical teams who had treated the over 200 wounded.\n\"These are lights for a cosmopolitan city,\" said Oliver Wiebe, one of the organizers.\nThe event took place at the same time as a demonstration led by the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) party on the Domplatz just across town, where attendees had chanted for \"deportations!\"\nLocal newspapers in Magdeburg and the surrounding areas of eastern Germany have warned against what they consider the \"instrumentalization\" of Friday night's attack while calling\u00a0on the authorities to investigate security failures thoroughly.\nIn Magdeburg itself, the local Volksstimme newspaper wrote:\n\"Three days on from the attack, and despite all appeals to the contrary, the political instrumentalization has begun. The right has blamed all migrants for the crime, while the left says it was the result of far-right radicalization. With the federal election coming up [in February], it's a battle for control of the narrative. In the end, it will lead to little \u2014\u00a0only to a further division of society. After all, the profile of the perpetrator can be interpreted in several ways.\n\"But that doesn't mean that [the attack] doesn't require investigation. Because, when people lose trust in the state's ability to protect them, the political center and ultimately democracy itself are endangered. We saw what that means on Saturday when groups of far-right demonstrators using sinister language could be observed.\"\nAnd in Cottbus, a city in the neighboring state of Brandenburg,the Lausitzer Rundschau newspaper wrote:\n\"One need not only look at the demonstrations by right-wing extremists to see that many more protagonists will be looking to score political points in relation to this attack. The CDU [Christian Democratic Union] wants to start turning [migrants] back at the borders again. But what does that have to do with the terror in Magdeburg? The terrorist arrived here legally, lived here legally, worked here legally \u00a0and evidently fell into madness here.\n\"As correct as it is to investigate the precise circumstances of this terrible crime and the security failures before it, the political instrumentalization is equally disingenuous. Regardless of who is doing it.\"\nGermany's far-right populist Alternative for Germany (AfD) party staged a demonstration on Magdeburg's central Domplatz on Monday evening in response to Friday night's deadly Christmas market attack.\nPrecise attendance figures were not immediately available, but footage appeared showed many people on the square listening to speeches made by AfD politicians, including chancellor candidate Alice Weidel and Jan Wenzel Schmidt, the AfD's leader for the state of Saxony-Anhalt.\n\"Someone who hates \u2014\u00a0and kills \u2014\u00a0the people of the country that gave him asylum, who hates all we stand for and all that we love, does not belong to us,\" said Weidel, who had traveled to Magdeburg from Berlin.\n\"We want things to finally change in this country so that we will never again have to mourn with the mother who has lost her son in such a pointless and brutal way,\" she continued, describing the attack as \"an act of an Islamist full of hatred for what constitutes human cohesion ... for us Germans, for us Christians.\"\nThe perpetrator of the Christmas market attack is a Saudi man who came to Germany in 2006. In social media posts, he called himself an atheist who renounced Islam and attacked German migration policies as too lenient. He also expressed sympathy for the AfD, saying it pursued the same goals he did.\nWenzel Schmidt called the attack a \"monstrous political failure\" on the part of the authorities who had granted the \"mass murderer\" asylum despite him having publicized his intentions (see entries below). Individual police officers, he said, had had their \"hands tied\" and been \"left alone\" by their superiors.\nDuring the demonstration, which was titled \"Grief unites \u2014 for a secure future,\" attendees intermittently chanted for \"deportations.\"\nAfter the speeches, the AfD is set to lead a march around the city center.\nSimultaneously, several counter-demonstrations took place with slogans such as \"We want to mourn \u2014\u00a0give hate no chance\" and \"Give fascism no chance.\"\nState police in Saxony-Anhalt\u00a0received a warning regarding the perpetrator of Friday night's Christmas market attack back in autumn 2023, but they didn't respond, local public broadcaster MDR reports.\nOn September 27, 2023, a member of the public contacted the police via direct message on Instagram, writing in English: \"There's a guy [who] said he's going to kill random German citizens, please do something and arrest him as soon as possible. Please answer, it's very urgent.\"\nThe warning also featured screenshots of posts made by the eventual perpetrator on \"X.\"\nAccording to MDR, the tipster had also contacted Germany's Federal Office for Migration and Refugees (BAMF) and police in Berlin, both of which had directed them to police in Saxony-Anhalt.\nAcknowledging the warning, BAMF said on Monday: \"This tip, like many others, was taken seriously. But since we are not an investigative authority, the person giving the warning was, as is always the case, referred directly to the responsible authorities.\"\nSaxony-Anhalt state police told MDR that they were unable to comment due to the ongoing investigation.\nGerman police contacted the perpetrator of Friday night's deadly attack in Magdeburg several times in the past year in order to conduct so-called preventative appeals.\nAccording to Saxony-Anhalt\u00a0Interior Minister\u00a0Tamara Zieschang, a first appeal took place in September 2023 and another in October 2024.\nPolice also attempted to conduct a preventative appeal in December 2023 regarding comments the perpetrator had made on social media. However, they were unable to confront him in person, a written appeal went unanswered and the investigation was dropped.\nProsecutors said the number of injured in the Magdeburg Christmas market attack\u00a0has risen to as many as 235 as more people have reported to hospitals and doctors.\nIt is, however, possible\u00a0there was some double-counting of the figures.\nTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video\n\nGermany's leading opposition party, the Christian Democratic Union (CDU), has called for the country's intelligence services to be strengthened after the attack in Magdeburg.\n\"We can no longer be satisfied with the fact that information about violent criminals and terrorists often only comes from foreign services,\" CDU lawmaker G\u00fcnter Krings the Handelsblatt newspaper. \"That is why our German security authorities need more powers of their own in order to gain more of their own knowledge, especially in the digital area.\"\nSaudi Arabia has previously requested the extradition of the attacker from Germany, a government source told the AFP news agency on Monday.\n\"There was [an extradition]\u00a0request,\" said the source, without giving the reason for the request, adding that Riyadh had warned he \"could be dangerous.\"\nThe CDU's Krings said security services must be able to remove dangerous people from society using information from their digital activities.\nThe German state of Saxony-Anhalt, of which Magdeburg is the capital, is offering psychological counseling to schoolchildren and educational staff who were caught up in the attack.\nHotlines are being set up on which the state's Education Ministry said \"those affected can use the hotlines to talk confidentially about their own feelings and fears.\"\nState Education Minister Eva Feussner said the attack had deeply affected the community.\n\"In addition to compassion for the victims and their families, it is also very important to support those seeking help and to support them in their healing process,\" said Feussner.\n\"We want to ensure that no one has to deal with the emotional stress of this tragedy alone. We stand together in this difficult time and will do everything we can to offer our children and the state's school staff the support they need.\"\nGerman Interior Minister Nancy Faeser and the heads of Germany's domestic and foreign intelligence services are due to answer questions about the Magdeburg Christmas market attack at a parliamentary committee next week, a senior lawmaker said.\nDirk Wiese, a member of Chancellor Olaf Scholz's Social Democrats, told the AFP news agency that officials from Germany's domestic and foreign intelligence agencies and the Office for Migration and Refugees had been called to a hearing on December 30.\nThere are unanswered questions about what the authorities knew about the perpetrator before Friday's attack.\nGermany's Federal Criminal Police (BKA) President Holger M\u00fcnch told public broadcaster ZDF the man had various contacts with authorities, during which he made insults and sometimes threats, but he was not known to be violent.\nM\u00fcnch described him as an \"atypical perpetrator.\"\nGermany's Federal Office for Migration and Refugees also acknowledged Sunday it had received a warning about the suspect last year.\nTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video\nA man who threatened severe criminal acts at Bremerhaven's Christmas market in a TikTok video was detained on Sunday night, police said.\nPolice in the German port city \"very quickly\"\u00a0 identified the suspect after the video was posted and took him into custody.\nThere are no details about the suspect or the specific threats made.\nPolice said there was no danger to the public.\nRead more about it here.\nGermany's far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) is set to hold a rally in Magdeburg on Monday evening.\nThe party's chancellor candidate, Alice Weidel, and several state AfD politicians are expected to attend the gathering at the city's Domplatz, followed by a march.\nIn an invitation to the event, the AfD claimed that the recent attack highlights the dangers of Germany's immigration policy.\nOn Saturday, scuffles broke out at a far-right rally in the city, billed as a \"demonstration against terror\" and attended by more than 2,000 people.\nProtesters held up a large banner bearing the word \"immigration,\"\u00a0a term popular with anti-immigration extremists seeking the mass deportation of migrants.\nTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video\nGerman Interior Minister Nancy Faeser has urged the swift adoption of draft laws to bolster internal security.\nThe deadly attack on a Christmas market in Magdeburg has raised questions about public safety and intelligence gaps in Germany.\n\"We must do everything in our power to protect the people of Germany from such horrific acts of violence. Our security authorities need all the necessary powers and additional personnel to achieve this,\" Faeser told Der Spiegel news magazine.\nFollowing the\u00a0Solingen knife attack\u00a0earlier this year, lawmakers tightened gun laws and strengthened security authorities' powers.\nFaeser, however, said further legislative changes were blocked by her Social Democratic Party (SPD) party's former governing coalition partner, the Free Democrats (FDP), the opposition Christian Democrats (CDU) and the CDU's Bavarian sister party, the Christian Social Union (CSU).\n\"All of these bills could be passed immediately if the [CDU and CSU] and FDP did not refuse to do so,\" she said.\nThe measures include\u00a0a new Federal Police Act, designed to strengthen the federal police, and the introduction of biometric surveillance.\nFDP General Secretary Marco Buschmann cautioned against hasty\u00a0actions.\n\"Our task is to support the victims and their families. Competing for symbolic measures would not do justice to the terrible situation,\" he told Der Spiegel.\nGermany will hold a federal election in February. Domestic security is likely to be an important issue in the campaign.\nBernd Baumann, the parliamentary head of the far-right AfD, called on Chancellor Olaf Scholz to convene a special session of the Bundestag regarding the \"desolate\" security situation, stating that \"this is the least we owe to the victims.\"\nMeanwhile, the head of the far-left BSW party, Sahra Wagenknecht, demanded Faeser explain \"why so many tips and warnings were ignored beforehand.\"\nThe CDU\u00a0and FDP called for enhancements to Germany's security apparatus, including improved coordination between federal and state authorities.\nTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video\nlo/rm\u00a0(AP, AFP, dpa, Reuters)",

Authorities believe he acted alone, but his background is unusual compared to previous attackers. A psychiatrist, he had lived in Germany since 2006, expressed anti-Islamic views, and had previously been monitored by authorities due to extreme statements.

            "content": "This video can not be played\nSuspect in German market attack appears in court\nA 50-year-old Saudi-born man is being held in Germany on suspicion of Friday night's car attack on hundreds of people visiting Magdeburg's Christmas market.\nThe attack killed five people, including a nine-year-old boy and four women, and left more than 200 injured, with many in a critical condition.\nPolice believe the suspect acted alone, but significant details have emerged about him that indicate this was a very different attack from anything Germany has seen before.\nThis video can not be played\nVideo shows arrest of Magdeburg attack suspect\nTaleb al-Abdulmohsen has lived in Germany since 2006 and is described as a psychiatrist who was living about 50km (30 miles) south of Magdeburg, in the town of Bernburg.\nAbdulmohsen does not fit the profile of attackers who caused mass casualties at Christmas markets in Berlin in 2016 and Strasbourg in France in 2018, or more recently at a festival in Solingen in August.\nHe is not an extreme Islamist - in fact, if you believe his social media posts and broadcast interviews, he appears to be have abandoned the faith and to have turned into an outspoken critic of Islam.\nThe motive behind the Magdeburg attack is for now unclear, but a picture of the suspect has emerged based on his past and the various interviews he gave.\nHe was granted asylum in 2016 and ran a website that aimed to help other former Muslims flee persecution in their Gulf homelands.\nGerman Interior Minister Nancy Faeser said it was \"clear to see\" the suspect held \"Islamophobic\" views.\nHe has also expressed sympathy on social media for Germany's far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD), known for its anti-immigration stance.\nEyewitness account: Witness saw car hit boyfriend in attack\nInvestigation ongoing: Police probe market security and warnings about suspect\nAs for the motive of Friday's killings in Magdeburg, Holger M\u00c3\u00bcnch of the federal criminal police has said it is too early to say.\n\"He has anti-Islamic views; of course he's also been involved with extreme-right platforms and given interviews,\" he told German media. \"But drawing a conclusion between what he says and what he's done... it's not yet possible to conclude it's politically motivated.\"\nThe suspect had been on the radar of German authorities for years, and the Saudis even tipped them off in November last year. Saudi sources said four official notifications known as \"Notes Verbale\" were sent warning German authorities of his \"very extreme views\".\nAlthough Saxony-Anhalt police did investigate him, he was never considered a threat because he had exhibited no violence before. Any potential threat was judged \"too unspecific\".\nMagdeburg police chief Tom-Oliver Langhans said police had conducted a threat assessment, \"but that discussion was one year ago\".\nAuthorities may have been wary of Saudi warnings. A counter-terrorism expert told the BBC the Saudis may have been mounting a disinformation campaign to discredit someone who tried to help young Saudi women seek asylum in Germany.\nIn 2013 Abdulmohsen was fined for breaching the peace by making a series of threats, and his flat was searched by the police. Then the following year he threatened to carry out acts that would command \"international attention\" if he did not get the support he wanted, officials said.\nAt the time he was living in northern Germany, and in 2015 he is alleged to have made threats on a hotline that he would get hold of a gun and take revenge on judges in his previous cases, reports say.\nBy 2016 he was granted asylum apparently on the grounds of political persecution, and in recent years he has accused several people of being spies for the Saudi government, according to German reports, and was himself accused of defamation.\nA picture has built up of a man who studied psychiatry and then worked from 2020 in a correctional facility for criminals in Bernburg, without being very good at his job.\nHis employer said he had been off work since October because of leave and illness, but a colleague told the local Mitteldeutsche Zeitung\" (MZ) they called him \"Dr Google\" because he always had to check his diagnosis online first.\nIn the meantime he was active on social media, promoting conspiracy theories regarding an alleged plot by German authorities to Islamicise Europe, and re-tweeting posts from the leader of the AfD and a far-right activist.\nHe maintained a website designed to help ex-Muslims flee the Gulf region. It carries the message in English as well as Arabic: \"My advice: do not seek asylum in Germany.\"\nThis video can not be played\nWatch Magdeburg attack suspect's 2019 interview with the BBC\n\nHe gave several interviews, including to the BBC and most recently German news magazine Die Zeit last year. The man who interviewed him, Christian Fuchs, said it was clear he no longer trusted the authorities and \"had a manic personality\".\nNancy Faeser told German newspaper Bild that investigators would examine \"in detail\" what information authorities had on Abdulmohsen in the past and how he had been investigated.\nThe German Office for Migration and Refugees announced in a post on social media that it had fielded a complaint about the suspect, which it had \"taken seriously\", but as the office was not an investigative body, it had referred the complainant to other authorities.\nAt 19:02 on Friday evening (18:02 GMT), the first call to emergency services was made.\nThe caller reported that a car had driven into a crowd at a Christmas market in the middle of Magdeburg.\nThe caller assumed it was an accident, police said, but it soon became clear this was not the case.\nThe driver, police said, had used traffic lights to turn off the road and on to a pedestrian crossing, leading him through an entry point to the market which was reserved for emergency vehicles, injuring a number of people on the way.\nFootage showed the driver speeding the vehicle through a pedestrian walkway between Christmas stalls.\nEyewitnesses described jumping out of the car's path, fleeing or hiding.\nPolice said the driver then returned to the road the way he came in and was forced to stop in traffic. Officers already at the market were able to apprehend and arrest the driver here.\nFootage showed armed police confronting and arresting a man who can be seen lying on the ground next to a stationary vehicle - a black BMW with significant damage to its front bumper and windscreen.\nThe entire incident was over in three minutes, police said.\nA nine-year-old boy, Andr\u00c3\u00a9 Gleissner, and four women aged 45, 52, 67 and 75 are confirmed to have died in the attack.\nMore than 200 people were injured and at least 41 of those are in a critical condition.\nThe Sch\u00c3\u00b6ppenstedt fire department paid tribute to Gleissner, in a Facebook post.\nThe fire department said the nine-year-old was a member of the children's fire brigade in Warle \u00e2\u0080\u0093 about an hour's drive from Magdeburg.\nTributes have been left at a church by the scene\nReporter describes 'chaotic situation' after Christmas market attack\nWere you at the Christmas market?

The country's far-right is instrumentalizing the incident to stoke fear and hatred.\nThe motive of Talib A.*, the suspected perpetrator of the deadly Christmas Market attack in Magdeburg, is still unclear. What has been confirmed\u00a0is that he is a Saudi citizen and that he is in custody.\nNevertheless, shortly after the attack, the extreme-right scene in Germany began to antagonize migrants.\n\"I have never experienced such a hostile and threatening environment,\" said a student studying automotive engineering in Magdeburg, the capital of the eastern state of\u00a0Saxony-Anhalt.\nSalam, a violence prevention center in Saxony-Anhalt, gave a similar account. The association has observed a significant increase in incidents against people seen as foreigners by right-wing extremists.\nTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video\nAccording to Salam, \"perceived migrants are branded as 'terrorists,' 'criminals' and 'lowlifes,' some are pushed around and spat at.\"\nThreats have gone so far that migrant communities have warned each other in WhatsApp groups and on Facebook against going out in public.\nThat the perpetrator of the Magdeburg attack is suspected of being an Islamophobe and a right-wing extremist is a paradox, Hans Goldenbaum, a radicalization expert at Salam, told German broadcaster MDR. \"It shows the power of this right extreme discourse and how sealed off he is from reality.\"\nSince the Christmas market attack on December 20, extreme-right\u00a0and neo-Nazi parties, associations and individuals have mobilized across Germany,\u00a0demanding the mass deportation of migrants.\nHundreds of neo-Nazis gathered at an extreme-right\u00a0rally in Magdeburg on December 22, two days after the attack. The demonstration saw aggression against journalists.\nOne of the speakers at a rally on Sunday was Thorsten Heise. A\u00a0militant neo-Nazi with several previous convictions, he once tried to run over a refugee with his car. Videos of the rally show Heise calling on the demonstrators to infiltrate associations, fire departments and authorities.\nJournalists and observers reported that participants in the rally shouted \"Wake up Germany,\" a phrase used during Nazi Germany under Adolf Hitler. Its usage is a punishable offense in Germany.\nAccording to police estimates, up to 3,500 people \u2014 including political party leaders and known extremists from the local hooligan scene \u2014 attended a demonstration promoted by the nationalist\u00a0far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) . Clothing and tattoos common among white supremacists were visible.\nAs AfD co-leader Alice Weidel spoke, the audience chanted: \"Deport, deport, deport.\" After the demonstration, attendees took to the streets. They attacked photographers, shouted nationalist slogans and tested the strength of the accompanying police.\nDavid Begrich, a right-wing extremism expert from the association Miteinander in Magdeburg, expects a broader politicization of the Christmas market attack. The\u00a0AfD\u00a0political party has organized large demonstrations in Magdeburg. Begrich strongly criticized the demonstrations, saying the focus after the attack should remain on the five victims and the 200 others wounded.\n\"I am witnessing great bewilderment and shock in Magdeburg,\" he told DW. \"This attack has deeply wounded the city. That also applies to me personally: my wife was one of those injured.\"\nBegrich said he thinks no one should politicize the attack as long as there are victims in the hospital.\u00a0\"The fate of the victims must be the main focus,\" he said. \"The reappraisal comes afterward. Communities do not want any politicization.\"\nDespite all the fake news, speculation and attempts at politicizing the deadly attack on social media, Begrich sees his city as truly affected by the tragedy.\n\"The city is coming together,\" he said.\n*Editor's note: DW follows the German press code, which stresses the importance of protecting the privacy of suspected criminals or victims and urges us to refrain from revealing the full names of alleged criminals.\nThis article was originally written in German.\nThis article was originally published on December 23, 2024, and updated on December 24, 2024, to include details of a rally promoted by the Alternative for Germany party.",

Chancellor Olaf Scholz condemned the attack, while opposition leaders emphasized the need for stricter asylum regulations ahead of the upcoming elections.",
            "content": "Reports that suspect was a refugee from Saudi Arabia who hated Muslims raise complicated questions during German election campaign.\nThe German government is reeling from an attack on a Christmas market in the city of Magdeburg that saw at least five people killed when a car apparently driven by an \u201cIslamophobic\u201d Saudi Arabian refugee plowed into Friday evening crowds.\nWith the country in the throes of an election campaign dominated by the issues of migration and Germany\u2019s failing economy, the tragedy, and the possible motivation behind it, triggered a stream of claims from politicians on all sides as the untypical nature of the attack started to emerge.\nReports suggested the German authorities had been warned about the suspected attacker. He allegedly supports the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) party, which is currently in second place in opinion polls.\n\u201cYesterday\u2019s horrific act in Magdeburg does not fit the pattern we have seen so far,\u201d said Friedrich Merz, leader of center-right Christian Democratic Union and on course to become Germany\u2019s next chancellor. \u201cThis obliges us politicians to pause for a moment.\u201d\nWhile the motive of the attack remains unclear and the background of the alleged suspect confounds initial theories that it was committed by an Islamic terrorist, the tragedy still puts the spotlight on Germany\u2019s attitude to immigration and border control.\nChancellor Olaf Scholz, whose center-left party looks set to lose power in February, described the attack as a \u201cterrible, insane act\u201d and said \u201cthose who want to sow hatred\u201d wouldn\u2019t win.\nBut Scholz faces important questions over the next few days about what was known of the suspect, his identity was confirmed by prosecutors as Taleb Al Abdulmohsen, a 50-year-old man. While prosecutors gave almost no details about the suspect, German media said Abdulmohsen is a Saudi Arabian psychiatrist who moved to Germany in 2006.\nThe Magdeburg chief prosecutor, Horst Walter Nopens, did indicate a Saudi connection.\n\u201cIt looks like the background to the crime could have been \u2026 dissatisfaction with the treatment of Saudi Arabian refugees in Germany,\u201d Nopens told a press conference on Saturday. \u201cBut what is deeper behind this is the subject of the investigation,\u201d he said.\nInterior Minister Nancy Faeser said the authorities can \u201csay with certainty that the perpetrator was obviously Islamophobic.\u201d\nThe chief prosecutor said the suspect is in police custody and has made a statement about the motive for the crime, but he declined to give any details about that statement. The investigators \u201cdo not yet know whether it was a terrorist attack,\u201d Nopens said.\nLate Saturday, a Magdeburg court approved pretrial detention for the suspect, the police said.\n\u201cThe judge ordered pretrial detention for five counts of murder, multiple attempted murder and multiple counts of dangerous bodily harm,\u201d the police said in a statement early Sunday.\nIn the immediate aftermath of the attack on Friday evening, right-wing parties seized on reports that the driver was a man from Saudi Arabia. The incident took place almost eight years to the day after a terrorist drove a truck into a Christmas market in Berlin.\nMigration has become a huge issue in Germany, which took in large numbers of refugees from Syria under former Chancellor Angela Merkel in 2015. With external commentators from Elon Musk, an adviser to United States President-elect Donald Trump, to Nigel Farage, leader of Reform UK, already commenting on Friday\u2019s tragedy, it has the potential to steer the debate even further in that direction.\nSeveral German media outlets identified the alleged attacker before prosecutors confirmed his name. WELT, a sister publication of POLITICO in the Axel Springer group, said the Saudi Arabian was granted refugee status in 2016.\nGerman media also reported that the alleged attacker was an AfD supporter. In 2019 interviews with Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung and Frankurter Rundschau, Abdulmohsen described his online anti-Islam advocacy and initiatives to help Saudis apply for asylum. \u201cI am the most aggressive critic of Islam in history. If you don\u2019t believe me, ask the Arabs,\u201d he said.\nOn his purported X account, Abdulmohsen claimed that \u201cGermany wants to islamize Europe\u201d and accused German police of \u201cusing dirty tactics against me and other critics of Islam \u2026 to destroy our anti-Islam activism.\u201d\nThe AfD, along with other far-right European parties, was quick to jump on reports that the alleged perpetrator was an immigrant. Alice Weidel, chair of the AfD, pointedly asked \u201cWhen will this madness end?\u201d while expressing her condolences for the victims of the attack.\nAt least five people were killed, including a child, according to the premier of Saxony-Anhalt, Reiner Haseloff, of the CDU. Some 200 others were injured in the attack, the prosecutors said.\nGermany\u2019s election, triggered by the collapse of a three-party coalition led by Scholz, is scheduled for Feb. 23.\n\u201cThere is no more peaceful and friendly place than a Christmas market,\u201d Scholz said on Saturday. \u201cNow it is important that \u2026 we don\u2019t let those who want to sow hatred get away with it, but that we also don\u2019t let the perpetrators go unprosecuted and that we take action with the full force of the law,\u201d he said.\nThe CDU\u2019s Merz has outlined a conservative vision for how he will govern, saying he will sharply reduce the number of asylum-seekers being allowed to settle in Germany.\nIn recent polls by Forschungsgruppe Wahlen on the main concerns of German voters,\u00a0the economic crisis overtook migration.\nThis could swing back after the attack, as it did following a killing at a festival this summer in Solingen in western Germany. Nevertheless, the leading parties have already adopted a tougher stance on migration in their election manifestos. The conservative CDU, like the AfD, wants to introduce border controls for Germany and make it easier to deport refugees.\nGerman Vice Chancellor Robert Habeck described the attack as \u201cterrible news\u201d in a place \u201cwhere people wanted to spend the Advent season in peace and community.\u201d Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock expressed shock at the incident and sent condolences to the victims and their families.\nThursday marked the eighth anniversary of the attack on Berlin\u2019s Breitscheidplatz Christmas market when Islamist Anis Amri killed 12 people with a truck. Another victim later died from his injuries.\nThis article has been updated.\nChancellor Olaf Scholz\u2019s latest demand is likely to stall a \u20ac3 billion aid package to the war-ravaged country as Russian forces continue their advance.\n\u201cThe objective exchange of arguments is becoming increasingly difficult\u201d on the platform formerly known as Twitter, says defense ministry.\nThe EU\u2019s strategy to deal with the far-right Freedom Party heading for power in Vienna is \u2026 hope for the best.\nConservative chancellor candidate Friedrich Merz railed against the climate policies of the left-leaning parties he\u2019ll likely have to govern with.",

The AfD's stance, rooted in nationalism and Euroscepticism, faces widespread unpopularity among the German public, with a survey indicating 87% support for remaining in the EU. Political analysts suggest the proposal may be a strategic move reflecting rising Euroscepticism in Europe.",
            "content": "Germany's far-right AfD has stated in its draft election manifesto that it wants to leave the EU and the euro in Brexit-like fashion. What consequences would this have for Germany and the bloc?\nThe far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) has doubled down on its pledge to take Germany out of the European Union and the single currency, the euro, if it gained power.\nIn a draft election manifesto sent to its members ahead of a vote in the party conference scheduled for early January, the anti-immigration party repeated a promise from its European election campaign in the summer, saying, \"We consider it necessary for Germany to leave the European Union and to establish a new European community.\"\nIn place of the EU, the AfD wants to introduce something it calls a \"Europe of fatherlands\" \u2014 an association of states that would include a common market and an \"economic and interests community.\"\nThe AfD also wants to take Germany out of Europe's common euro currency which was introduced in 2002, and replace it with what it calls a \"transfer union.\" The party admits in the manifesto that a \"hard cut\" would be counterproductive and proposes renegotiating relations with all the member states as well as other European countries.\nThe AfD wants Germany to hold a referendum on the issue \u2014 though actually getting out of the EU wouldn't be that easy, since Germany's membership is anchored in the German Constitution, the Basic Law. Even if some future AfD-led German government were to declare Germany's exit from the EU, it would effectively be unconstitutional, as a \"Dexit\" would also require a two-thirds majority in the German parliament.\nTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video\nThe AfD's plan does represent a toughening of the party's position on the EU: It was only in February 2024 that the party's co-leader Tino Chrupalla said that it was \"too late\" for Germany to leave the EU.\nHis co-leader and the party's chancellor candidate Alice Weidel described Dexit merely as a \"Plan B\" in an interview with the British Financial Times earlier this year.\nGermany's leading economic institutes and industry associations have all condemned the proposal. The Cologne-based German Economic Institute (IW) concluded in a study in May this year that, over five years, leaving the EU would cost the country \u20ac690 billion ($725 billion), cause the country's GDP to shrink by 5.6%, and would mean 2.5 million fewer jobs on the market. The damage would be \"comparable with the coronavirus crisis and the energy crisis put together,\" the IW study said.\nThe German Association of Small and Medium Businesses (BVMW) was even more excoriating, describing the AfD's plan as an \"economic kamikaze mission.\"\nIn a statement released ahead of the EU election in June 2024, the BVMW set out all the positives that the single currency brings to small and medium-sized businesses: \"The monetary union is a useful complement to the EU single market. The EU single market makes it considerably easier for companies to sell goods and services in other EU countries. The euro helps to eliminate incalculable risks for companies in trade.\"\nTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video\nRonald Gl\u00e4ser, an AfD spokesperson in Berlin, dismissed these concerns.\n\"Yes, Germany profits from the EU, but we believe that we would have the advantages of it if we arrived at other agreements,\" Gl\u00e4ser told DW. \"And when economists claim that it would be an economic catastrophe, then all I can do is ask: Are those the same ones who said Europe and England would be terribly affected? I can remember all the horror scenarios around Brexit, and it all went more or less smoothly.\"\nA report released by Cambridge Econometrics in January this year found that Brexit is stifling growth and employment in the UK, with an estimated three million fewer jobs in the country by 2035.\nThe IW's study was based on studying the effects of Brexit on the regions of Britain that have similar economies to equivalent regions in Germany.\n\"Our estimate was fairly conservative,\" warned IW's executive director Hubertus Bardt, who co-authored the report. \"We could easily have much stronger effects because we are more closely intertwined in the EU than the British were \u2014 we have the euro, which would mean more complications than the British had.\"\nDexit would mean that \"we would be over 5 and a half percent poorer in five years' time,\" Bardt told DW. \"That's a severe economic crisis with advanced warning.\" It would of course be particularly damaging for companies that depend on markets and suppliers elsewhere in the EU, he added.\nThe AfD's Gl\u00e4ser believes that an alternative version could still preserve free trade.\n\"Why should all the companies and consumers in Italy, France, Sweden, or wherever, not want German products anymore just because we're not in the EU anymore?\" he said. \"Switzerland isn't in the EU, and it exports to all these countries.\"\nBut Bardt had no time for the AfD's plan to replace the EU with a different economic community: \"I consider this to be an unrealistic and meaningless notion or a smokescreen,\" he said. \"Destroying the EU will not result in a new and better integration model emerging in its place.\"\nTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video\nNor is Dexit even remotely popular among the German population \u2014 a survey published earlier this year by the Konrad Adenauer Foundation (KAS) \u2014 which is affiliated with the conservative Christian Democratic Union (CDU) \u2014 found that 87% of Germans would vote to stay in the EU in a referendum.\nSo why has the AfD decided to include such a drastic and unpopular measure in its election manifesto? Gl\u00e4ser insisted that leaving the EU would be good for Germans, whether they liked it or not: \"We don't do policies based on surveys \u2014 we want to implement what is necessary and important.\"\nWolfgang Schroeder, a political scientist at Kassel University, pointed out that the AfD's stance is consistent with its foundation \u2014 the party initially emerged in 2013 as a party of economists critical of the EU's bailouts following the euro crisis. Since then, it has drifted further right and anti-immigration, but its Euroscepticism has remained \u2014 though it is now less obvious.\n\"The AfD is primarily a nationalist party,\" Schroeder told DW. \"It opposes globalization \u2014 that has always brought with it a skeptical attitude to international authorities. For them, all international organizations like the EU and the UN have their own aims and values, and so are a danger to the true will of the people.\"\nBut is the AfD serious about its proposal to replace the EU with another kind of international community, given the economic and constitutional headaches that this would cause?\n\"We could answer that in two ways,\" said Schroeder. \"On the one hand, we could say they don't mean it seriously because they know they're representing a minority position, so they can formulate it simply to paint a picture of a different world \u2014 it doesn't cost them anything to say it.\"\nPersonally, Schroeder thinks the AfD position is kind of a cheap long-term bet: \"They're betting that more and more countries that agree with this Euroskepticism, and that in future there will be a new development that goes in the direction of Eurasia, with new economic and political prospects.\"\nEdited by Rina Goldenberg\nWhile you're here: Every Tuesday, DW editors round up what is happening in German politics and society.

Economic studies warn that leaving the EU could severely damage Germany's economy, leading to significant job losses and GDP decline.

            "content": "Germany's far-right AfD has stated in its draft election manifesto that it wants to leave the EU and the euro in Brexit-like fashion. What consequences would this have for Germany and the bloc?\nThe far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) has doubled down on its pledge to take Germany out of the European Union and the single currency, the euro, if it gained power.\nIn a draft election manifesto sent to its members ahead of a vote in the party conference scheduled for early January, the anti-immigration party repeated a promise from its European election campaign in the summer, saying, \"We consider it necessary for Germany to leave the European Union and to establish a new European community.\"\nIn place of the EU, the AfD wants to introduce something it calls a \"Europe of fatherlands\" \u2014 an association of states that would include a common market and an \"economic and interests community.\"\nThe AfD also wants to take Germany out of Europe's common euro currency which was introduced in 2002, and replace it with what it calls a \"transfer union.\" The party admits in the manifesto that a \"hard cut\" would be counterproductive and proposes renegotiating relations with all the member states as well as other European countries.\nThe AfD wants Germany to hold a referendum on the issue \u2014 though actually getting out of the EU wouldn't be that easy, since Germany's membership is anchored in the German Constitution, the Basic Law. Even if some future AfD-led German government were to declare Germany's exit from the EU, it would effectively be unconstitutional, as a \"Dexit\" would also require a two-thirds majority in the German parliament.\nTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video\nThe AfD's plan does represent a toughening of the party's position on the EU: It was only in February 2024 that the party's co-leader Tino Chrupalla said that it was \"too late\" for Germany to leave the EU.\nHis co-leader and the party's chancellor candidate Alice Weidel described Dexit merely as a \"Plan B\" in an interview with the British Financial Times earlier this year.\nGermany's leading economic institutes and industry associations have all condemned the proposal. The Cologne-based German Economic Institute (IW) concluded in a study in May this year that, over five years, leaving the EU would cost the country \u20ac690 billion ($725 billion), cause the country's GDP to shrink by 5.6%, and would mean 2.5 million fewer jobs on the market. The damage would be \"comparable with the coronavirus crisis and the energy crisis put together,\" the IW study said.\nThe German Association of Small and Medium Businesses (BVMW) was even more excoriating, describing the AfD's plan as an \"economic kamikaze mission.\"\nIn a statement released ahead of the EU election in June 2024, the BVMW set out all the positives that the single currency brings to small and medium-sized businesses: \"The monetary union is a useful complement to the EU single market. The EU single market makes it considerably easier for companies to sell goods and services in other EU countries. The euro helps to eliminate incalculable risks for companies in trade.\"\nTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video\nRonald Gl\u00e4ser, an AfD spokesperson in Berlin, dismissed these concerns.\n\"Yes, Germany profits from the EU, but we believe that we would have the advantages of it if we arrived at other agreements,\" Gl\u00e4ser told DW. \"And when economists claim that it would be an economic catastrophe, then all I can do is ask: Are those the same ones who said Europe and England would be terribly affected? I can remember all the horror scenarios around Brexit, and it all went more or less smoothly.\"\nA report released by Cambridge Econometrics in January this year found that Brexit is stifling growth and employment in the UK, with an estimated three million fewer jobs in the country by 2035.\nThe IW's study was based on studying the effects of Brexit on the regions of Britain that have similar economies to equivalent regions in Germany.\n\"Our estimate was fairly conservative,\" warned IW's executive director Hubertus Bardt, who co-authored the report. \"We could easily have much stronger effects because we are more closely intertwined in the EU than the British were \u2014 we have the euro, which would mean more complications than the British had.\"\nDexit would mean that \"we would be over 5 and a half percent poorer in five years' time,\" Bardt told DW. \"That's a severe economic crisis with advanced warning.\" It would of course be particularly damaging for companies that depend on markets and suppliers elsewhere in the EU, he added.\nThe AfD's Gl\u00e4ser believes that an alternative version could still preserve free trade.\n\"Why should all the companies and consumers in Italy, France, Sweden, or wherever, not want German products anymore just because we're not in the EU anymore?\" he said. \"Switzerland isn't in the EU, and it exports to all these countries.\"\nBut Bardt had no time for the AfD's plan to replace the EU with a different economic community: \"I consider this to be an unrealistic and meaningless notion or a smokescreen,\" he said. \"Destroying the EU will not result in a new and better integration model emerging in its place.\"\nTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video\nNor is Dexit even remotely popular among the German population \u2014 a survey published earlier this year by the Konrad Adenauer Foundation (KAS) \u2014 which is affiliated with the conservative Christian Democratic Union (CDU) \u2014 found that 87% of Germans would vote to stay in the EU in a referendum.\nSo why has the AfD decided to include such a drastic and unpopular measure in its election manifesto? Gl\u00e4ser insisted that leaving the EU would be good for Germans, whether they liked it or not: \"We don't do policies based on surveys \u2014 we want to implement what is necessary and important.\"\nWolfgang Schroeder, a political scientist at Kassel University, pointed out that the AfD's stance is consistent with its foundation \u2014 the party initially emerged in 2013 as a party of economists critical of the EU's bailouts following the euro crisis. Since then, it has drifted further right and anti-immigration, but its Euroscepticism has remained \u2014 though it is now less obvious.\n\"The AfD is primarily a nationalist party,\" Schroeder told DW. \"It opposes globalization \u2014 that has always brought with it a skeptical attitude to international authorities. For them, all international organizations like the EU and the UN have their own aims and values, and so are a danger to the true will of the people.\"\nBut is the AfD serious about its proposal to replace the EU with another kind of international community, given the economic and constitutional headaches that this would cause?\n\"We could answer that in two ways,\" said Schroeder. \"On the one hand, we could say they don't mean it seriously because they know they're representing a minority position, so they can formulate it simply to paint a picture of a different world \u2014 it doesn't cost them anything to say it.\"\nPersonally, Schroeder thinks the AfD position is kind of a cheap long-term bet: \"They're betting that more and more countries that agree with this Euroskepticism, and that in future there will be a new development that goes in the direction of Eurasia, with new economic and political prospects.\"\nEdited by Rina Goldenberg\nWhile you're here: Every Tuesday, DW editors round up what is happening in German politics and society.

He emphasizes a \"positive agenda\" that benefits both American and European consumers, proposing a revival of the stalled EU-US trade deal, TTIP. Merz also calls for reducing Germany's corporate tax rates to make the country more competitive. He acknowledges potential challenges posed by Trump's administration, including higher tariffs, but insists Germany should not retaliate with its own tariffs. The US remains a crucial export market for Germany.",
            "content": "Friedrich Merz said a new push for a free trade deal with the US could \"prevent a dangerous spiral of tariffs.\" The opposition Christian Democrat leader hopes to become chancellor after February's early elections.\nThe conservative Christian Democratic Union (CDU) candidate for chancellor, and apparent frontrunner for early elections in February in Germany, Friedrich Merz, has called for a \"positive agenda\" on trade\u00a0with the US and returning President Donald Trump.\n\"We need a positive agenda with the US that benefits American and European consumers alike,\" Merz said in an interview with the German dpa news agency published on Thursday.\nHe even recommended considering renewed attempts at an EU-US free trade deal, after the previous efforts, dubbed TTIP, were put on ice in 2017, early in Trump's first term.\n\"A new European-American inititative for joint free trade could prevent a dangerous spiral of tariffs,\" Merz said.\nHowever, Merz also made clear he did anticipate more difficult conditions for European economies after Trump's January 20 inauguration.\nHe said it likely made sense to prepare for the US focusing more on itself and its own perceived interests, for instance via higher import tariffs, as Trump repeatedly said he would during and since\u00a0the election campaign.\n\"But our answer to that should not be: 'Now we'll start with our tariffs too,'\" Merz said.\nMerz also said that Germany needed to gradually reduce its corporation tax rates towards 25%, with current levels nearer 30%. He said this would tackle non-wage labor costs and make the country an attractive place to do business again.\nThen, he said, Germany could\u00a0tell the United States: \"Yes, we are ready to face this competition with you as well.\"\nThe US is Germany's most successful export market at roughly 10% of all its foreign sales or \u20ac157.9 billion (roughly $163.5 billion) in 2023. The figure continued rising in 2024, based on partial data.\nTariffs could therefore have serious implications for the German economy, or at least parts of it.\nMeanwhile, the US is the third most common source for\u00a0German imports \u2014 well behind China, and slightly behind the neighboring Netherlands \u2014\u00a0accounting for about 7% of German imports, or \u20ac94.7 billion.\nTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video\nThis means Germany has a record annual\u00a0trade surplus with the US of a little over \u20ac63 billion that has been rising slightly in the past few years.\nOne statistic absent from this count, however, is the US also being the most common site for direct investment by German companies.\nTrump has often lamented this imbalance in bilateral trade, particularly during the election campaign. In several interviews he recalled supposed conversations with previous Chancellor Angela Merkel where he had complained about how few US cars were sold in Germany, for instance, compared to German ones in the US.\n\nmsh/wd (dpa, Reuters)",

Divergences between France and Germany on trade, particularly concerning China and the Mercosur agreement, highlight ongoing tensions within the EU.",
            "content": "Christian Democrat Friedrich Merz hopes to revive talks on a broad trade deal with the U.S.\nAI generated Text-to-speech\nBRUSSELS \u2014 Maybe the Franco-German economic engine will soon sputter back to life after all.\nGermany\u2019s likely next chancellor, Friedrich Merz, can be good news for the European Union, France\u2019s newly appointed Trade Minister Laurent Saint-Martin told POLITICO, after years of friction between Paris and Berlin and looming fractures across the bloc over how to deal with the United States and China.\n\u201cWe can also look at the rather pro-European character of this would-be chancellor \u2026 There are also good reasons to be optimistic,\u201d Saint-Martin said on a visit to Brussels on Friday, in one of his first interviews since taking over the portfolio in late December.\n\u201cWhat\u2019s certain is that France\u2019s position on this issue will not change: We need a strong Germany, [which, together] with France, thinks about a Europe that invests; in a Europe that protects; and a Europe that once again thinks about its industrial future and its own sovereignty,\u201d he said.\nMuch will depend on the result of the early German election on Feb. 23, Saint-Martin cautioned.\nMerz and his center-right Christian Democratic Union currently lead on 31 percent, well ahead of Chancellor Olaf Scholz\u2019s center-left Social Democratic Party on 16 percent, according to POLITICO\u2019s Poll of Polls. Scholz\u2019s \u201ctraffic light\u201d coalition of Greens, Social Democrats and the Free Democratic Party collapsed in November amid acrimony over spending and economic reforms.\nThe far-right Alternative for Germany is polling in second place on 20 percent, but Merz is clear he will never enter into a coalition with the populist, anti-immigrant party.\nThe CDU leader said last week that the EU should reconsider sealing a broad trade deal with the United States \u2014 harking back to ill-fated talks on the controversial Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership a decade ago.\nTalks with Washington fell through in 2016, over concerns in the EU that its market would be flooded with chlorinated chicken; workers\u2019 rights would be undermined; and state health services opened up to American companies.\nResuming the free-trade talks with Washington would be a red line for France and put Paris and Berlin at odds. Still, Merz\u2019s more critical tone toward China, which contrasts with the fealty shown by Scholz and longtime CDU Chancellor Angela Merkel, might bring Berlin closer to the position defended by Paris and the European Commission.\nA closer relationship between the two countries might also help ease their major differences on how to deal with China. France has advocated for a tougher approach, which includes \u201cBuy European\u201d measures in public tenders, but also tariffs on subsidized Chinese imports. Germany, which has closer trade ties with China, has been more cautious, fearing a trade war with Beijing.\nThe divergence between the two peaked when Brussels imposed tariffs on imports of Chinese electric vehicles last fall, delighting France but disappointing Germany, which voted against the measure on concerns that its carmakers would suffer Chinese retaliation.\nSaint-Martin, who hails from President Emmanuel Macron\u2019s liberal party, has already worked on trade as head of Business France, the country\u2019s organization in charge of helping French companies to export and attracting foreign investors.\nUntil a few weeks ago, he was a junior minister in charge of an even harder task: putting together a budget for 2025 that would reduce France\u2019s massive deficit while getting the nod from a fragmented parliament \u2014 the budget was not adopted as Michel Barnier\u2019s government collapsed last month precisely over that file.\nHis comments come amid a wide Franco-German divergence on Europe\u2019s economic agenda and especially on the bloc\u2019s two main trade files: the trade agreement with South American countries of the Mercosur bloc struck in December, and mounting trade tensions with China.\nGermany is one of the top supporters of the Mercosur agreement, seeing it as a golden opportunity to export more goods to a region that is increasingly courted by China. France is the fiercest opponent of a deal that is hated by its farmers, who fear competition from South American imports, but also environmental NGOs and parties across the political spectrum.\n\u201cThe way in which the agreement was signed did not suit us, and the French demands were not taken into account,\u201d Saint-Martin said, referring to a trip in December by European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen and the EU's trade chief Maro\u0161 \u0160ef\u010dovi\u010d to seal the deal in Uruguay just hours after the last French government had collapsed.\n\u201cWe absolutely do not consider that what has been agreed today is valid for us,\u201d he stressed, pointing out he raised the issue in his meeting on Friday with \u0160ef\u010dovi\u010d.\nThe proposed meeting signals to Washington, days before Trump\u2019s inauguration, that Brussels wants to keep its options open toward Beijing.\nMalaysian Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim is expected in Brussels next week and will give a speech in Bruges on Jan 20.\nA legal fight looms as EU and Mercosur countries don\u2019t see eye to eye on a key clause of their fresh trade deal.\nKeir Starmer praises incoming ambassador \u2014 a former European trade commissioner \u2014 for his  \u201cunrivalled experience,\u201d as former colleagues rate his chances in Trumpworld.",

I have also made it clear in the Colombian media that the way into the German labor market is not through asylum law, but only through the proper immigration of skilled workers,\" Stamp told DW.\nTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video\nThis is because the latest approval rate for asylum seekers from Colombia was 0.4%, meaning that only one in 250 Colombians had their asylum application approved. At the same time, however, an increasing number of Colombians are trying to immigrate to Germany by making applications for asylum. While the number of applications was 138 in 2018, last year 3,337 people from Colombia applied for asylum in Germany.\nThere are currently 14,000 Colombians living in Germany who are working and paying social security contributions. In addition, there are 3,500 students and postgraduates, as well as around 500 academics.\nGermany aims to promote the regular migration of workers and decrease the number of ineligible asylum applications by establishing comprehensive migration partnerships with countries such as Colombia, Georgia, Uzbekistan, Morocco and Kenya. The aim is to prevent cases like the one in the Wilstedt care facility from happening again in the future.\n\"It is a tragedy when nice and hard-working people are exploited by smugglers and misled into seeking asylum. Many people are clearly being purposefully misinformed by the smuggling networks,\" said Joachim Stamp. \"Colombians who want to come to Germany should find their way into the job market and not into refugee shelters.\"\nThis article was originally published in German.\nWhile you're here: Every Tuesday, DW editors round up what is happening in German politics and society.

Despite a successful first year and strong results in state elections, polls indicate the BSW may struggle to secure the 5% needed to enter federal parliament. The party opposes German arms deliveries to Ukraine and advocates stricter immigration policies, setting it apart from the Left party. Wagenknecht believes the BSW can influence government formation despite potential coalition challenges with other parties.",
            "content": "The former leader of Germany's socialist Left party is aiming to get her eponymous Sahra Wagenknecht Alliance into the Bundestag in its first federal election in February. Polls suggest that she may fail.\nThe new Sahra Wagenknecht Alliance (BSW)\u00a0is finalizing its campaign platform at Sunday's\u00a0party conference\u00a0in Bonn. Founded to much media fanfare in January 2024, the party\u00a0enjoyed a significant winning streak in its first year.\nFounded by the\u00a0former leader of the socialist\u00a0Left party\u00a0and composed mostly of former members, too, the BSW went on to achieve double-digit results in three state elections. In the eastern states of Brandenburg and Thuringia, the party is already a coalition partner in\u00a0the provincial governments.\nNow, the BSW is seeking to enter the Bundestag in the general election scheduled for February 23, 2025, for which it will need to garner at least 5% of the vote. That's a tall order as it will be hard to find enough candidates among\u00a0only 1,000 party members, a result of the strict scrutiny applied to people who want to join the alliance.\nCurrently, 10 lawmakers represent the BSW in the Bundestag, Germany's lower house of parliament. They all won their seats in 2021\u00a0as candidates for the Left party. In 2025, they are running for the BSW. According to the latest poll in Germany, the party is polling at around\u00a05%.\nShould\u00a0Wagenknecht\u00a0and her alliance make it into the Bundestag\u00a0\u2014 parties in Germany must secure at least 5% of the vote to enter the federal parliament\u00a0\u2014\u00a0it would probably be as an opposition party. The main obstacle to building a coalition at the national level is the BSW's position on support for Ukraine in defending itself\u00a0against Russia's invasion\u00a0.\u00a0The BSW is calling for an end to German arms deliveries to Ukraine, an unacceptable position for the potential governing parties: the center-right Christian Democrats (CDU) and Christian Social Union (CSU), center-left Social Democrats (SPD) and\u00a0Greens. As all other parties have done, the BSW has ruled out forming a coalition with the far-right\u00a0Alternative for Germany (AfD).\nThe BSW and Left party have a lot of overlap\u00a0on economic and social policy. However, they disagree fundamentally on asylum\u00a0policy. The Left party does not seek further restrictions on\u00a0immigration, while the BSW advocates more deterrence to keep displaced people from arriving to Germany in large numbers.\nThe BSW and the Left both object to heavy\u00a0military support for Ukraine and\u00a0Israel\u00a0and are skeptical of\u00a0NATO.\nTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video\nBoth the Left party and the BSW warn that Germany could be dragged into a war. \"We need a German government that does everything it can to reduce this threat,\" Wagenknecht says at campaign events.\nThe 55-year-old is a fixture on\u00a0political TV talk shows in Germany and she is firmly convinced that she will make it into the Bundestag. \"In the best-case scenario, we even have the opportunity to help shape a government,\" Wagenknecht has said.\nAn economist who was raised in communist-ruled\u00a0East Germany, Wagenknecht describes her party as breaking the mold of traditional political classifications. She believes that people don't even know what labels such as \"left\" and \"right\" mean.\nShe has also argued against stonewalling the AfD. In 2023, she\u00a0said it was wrong to deride all AfD supporters as \"Nazis.\" \"They are simply conservative people who used to be in the CDU,\" she said back then.\nThis article was originally written in German.\nWhile you're here: Every Tuesday, DW editors round up what is happening in German politics and society.

The BSW, which aims to differentiate itself as a \"peace party,\" has gained traction in eastern Germany but struggles in the west, where support is below the 5% threshold needed for parliamentary entry. The party's manifesto includes controversial immigration policies and a call for disarmament, reflecting a split from the Left party over asylum and migration. Despite low poll ratings, Wagenknecht remains optimistic about the upcoming election.",
            "content": "The former parliamentary leader of the Left party is seeking to enter the Bundestag with her BSW. But the party will need to make inroads in the western states where she has always performed weakest.\nLast weekend's party conference in Bonn, western Germany, was extra special for the Sahra Wagenknecht Alliance (BSW): The party will take part in its first federal election in February, and this was its chance to present its manifesto.\nFounded in January 2024, the BSW made it through the dress rehearsal with flying colors: In September's elections in the eastern German states of Brandenburg, Saxony, and Thuringia, the BSW took 12%-16% of the vote, eclipsing the socialist Left party\u00a0from which it drew many of its state and federal parliamentarians.\nDespite this, Wagenknecht is worried that the party bearing her name will fail to reach the 5%\u00a0threshold in the early Bundestag elections. This is because only around 10 million of Germany's 59 million eligible voters live in the east, less than one-fifth of the electorate. In the west, support for the BSW is significantly lower.\nThis was already evident in the European elections in June, when the BSW received 6.2% of the German vote. The regional differences were huge: In eastern states, support ranged from roughly 13% to 16%, but in western states the BSW averaged well below 5%. Only in the small state of Saarland (1 million inhabitants) and in the city-state of Bremen (580,000 inhabitants) did it surpass this threshold.\nThe BSW is looking at similar figures in the upcoming Bundestag elections. According to the latest opinion polls, the BSW has no margin for error: Its poll rating are hovering at the 5% mark necessary to enter the German parliament.\nTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video\nAt the party conference in Bonn, BSW founder Wagenknecht blamed the weak poll results on a lack of media coverage. \"I think it's pretty undemocratic,\" she told public broadcaster BR shortly before the convention.\nBut a look at the TV political talk shows on German broadcasters ARD and ZDF paints a different picture: With 12 appearances, Wagenknecht was the most frequently invited politician on these public broadcasters in 2024.\nDespite the polls, the BSW leader appeared confident and combative in Bonn: She reminded members that they are a young party and still do not have a core constituency. Many people do not yet know who they want to vote for, Wagenknecht said. \"We are only just getting started in this campaign.\" The party platform adopted at the convention will now lay the groundwork.\nIn this newly-minted manifesto, the BSW describes itself as the only \"peace party\" in the German Bundestag that is consistent in its opposition to the current buildup in arms as well as the supply of weapons into war zones.\nThat has, however, long been a core tenet of the socialist Left Party, which Wagenknecht and many of her long-standing supporters have turned their backs.\nThe reason for the split was their opposing views on asylum and migration policy. While the Left Party is the only party represented in the Bundestag that opposes adopting stricter asylum policies, the BSW demands, among other things, that asylum procedures be carried out outside the European Union in so-called safe third countries and that criminal refugees be deported.\nIn terms of its content and rhetoric, some passages in the BSW's electoral program resemble that of other parties, including the Alternative for Germany (AfD), a party with far-right extremist elements.\nThe BSW program criticizes the \"uncontrolled influx of people,\" and claims that little is known about the biographies of these immigrants or their willingness to integrate. \"The naive policy of welcoming immigrants in recent years has already led to a disproportionate increase in knife crime, sexual offenses, and religiously-motivated terrorism,\" the BSW election manifesto claims.\nOn the question of how Russia's war in Ukraine should be ended, there is some overlap with the Left Party. The BSW wants a ceasefire without preconditions, and is warning against stumbling into a new arms race. \"We must not prepare for war in the nuclear age,\" she is said. \"A new policy of de-escalation is needed. Wars are ended through negotiations.\"\nSince the attack on\u00a0Israel by the Islamist group Hamas on October 7, 2023, the BSW has described\u00a0the Middle East as a \"powder keg.\" It has said that all the major powers in the region are fighting their conflicts on the backs of the population.\n\"What began as Israel's self-defense against the Hamas massacre has long since turned into a ruthless campaign of revenge and extermination by the Netanyahu government against women and children in the Gaza Strip,\" its election manifesto reads.\nThe BSW also rejects increased military spending: \"The narrative of the Bundeswehr being 'cut to the bone' is a myth. German military spending has more than doubled since 2014 and amounted to almost \u20ac90 billion ($92 billion) in 2024.\"\nGermany has now reached the target agreed upon by the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) of investing 2% of its economic output in its defense budget.\nIf the BSW and its official chancellor candidate Sahra Wagenknecht had their way, Germany would disarm. It is questionable whether the new party will be able to commit to this in the next Bundestag, and if the BSW fails to enter the Bundestag at all, it would be a personal defeat for its founder.\nMeanwhile, the Left Party, Wagenknecht's former party, may even be able to make it into the Bundestag without crossing the 5% hurdle. To do so, it would have to win at least three constituencies directly, as the Left Party did in 2021. It was thus able to receive\u00a0almost 40 seats in the Bundestag, though its share of the vote was only 4.9%. Wagenknecht was one of those who benefited from this, and was able to enter parliament as one of these representatives.\nAt the end of the party's electoral convention, the BSW's leader was bullish as she appealed to the 600 or so delegates to go into the election campaign: \"Now let's fight together! For we will make February 23 a huge success!\"\nThis article was translated from German.\nWhile you're here: Every Tuesday, DW editors round up what is happening in German politics and society.

In response, the Bundestag has enshrined judicial independence rules in the constitution to prevent radical parties from undermining the judiciary. The legislation requires a two-thirds majority for any future changes to court governance. While the AfD stands at 19% in polling, its legislative power remains limited due to widespread party isolation. This vote marks the first legislative action since Chancellor Olaf Scholz's coalition collapsed in November.",
            "content": "Far-right AfD is polling in second place ahead of Germany\u2019s snap election set for Feb. 23.\nGermany\u2019s Bundestag enshrined the rules governing its highest court in the country\u2019s constitution on Thursday to prevent ever-stronger radical parties from attacking judicial independence in the future.\nThe vote came as Germany\u2019s mainstream political leaders confront growing concerns about the strength of the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) party, which is polling in second place ahead of Germany\u2019s Feb. 23 snap election, potentially setting it up to become the largest opposition party in the next parliament.\n\u201cWhen we look abroad, we see that when autocrats come to power, they almost always turn against the effectiveness and independence of the judiciary first,\u201d Interior Minister Nancy Faeser, a member of the Social Democratic Party (SPD), said in a debate prior to the vote.\nMore than two-thirds of German parliamentarians voted to embed the rules in the constitution; they include limits on how many judges can sit on the court and for how long. Lawmakers said the changes were meant to bolster the court\u2019s independence and prevent the judiciary from being hijacked as happened in Germany\u2019s Nazi past.\nThe vote represented a rare point of agreement among political parties in the run-up to the country\u2019s early election. The campaign thus far has been unusually contentious by Germany\u2019s normally staid standards.\nSPD Chancellor Olaf Scholz, in a TV interview this week, referred to his main conservative opponent and frontrunner to become the next chancellor, Friedrich Merz, as \u201cFritz,\u201d a moniker perceived as belittling. Merz\u2019s ally, Bavarian conservative leader Markus S\u00f6der, in turn called Scholz the \u201cmost embarrassing chancellor our country [has] ever had.\u201d\nBut the center-left and center-right parties agreed to put their differences aside to pass the new law. Any future government will now need a two-thirds majority to change the rules governing the court, instead of a simple majority.\nThe AfD is currently polling at 19 percent, well below the strength it would need to pass legislation, and most other parties have refused to work with it. But the Thursday vote expresses the stark fears of lawmakers that the AfD\u2019s influence will only grow.\nAs potentially the largest opposition party in the next parliament, the AfD will benefit from a bigger platform \u2014 but the party\u2019s power will remain limited, largely due to its isolation.\n\u201cThe party will get more visibility through increased speaking time in parliament, and [will] have more money at its disposal,\u201d said Wolfgang Schroeder, a political science professor at the University of Kassel. \u201cBut it won\u2019t be a quantum leap.\u201d\nAfD lawmakers said the new legislation  proved the court was an instrument of the political mainstream.\n\u201cYou are telling an ever-increasing number of voters, citizens of our republic, that this is not their state, that this is not their constitutional court,\u201d said AfD lawmaker Fabian Jacobi in parliament. \u201cWhat you are projecting to the outside world with what you are doing here is an image of our constitutional court as an instrument of power.\u201d\nFormer German Justice Minister Marco Buschmann, who led negotiations on the bill before the collapse of Scholz\u2019s government, repeatedly cited Poland and Hungary as cautionary tales of how populist leaders, once elected, work to erode the strength and independence of the courts.\nThe 16 justices ruling Germany\u2019s constitutional court currently serve 12-year terms. To assure their independence, they cannot be reelected.\nThe Thursday vote marked the first time the parliament has passed legislation since Scholz\u2019s coalition fell in early November. Lawmakers were also set to approve a series of popular measures, including an increase in monthly child allowance and a reduction in creeping tax increases due to inflation.\nChancellor Olaf Scholz\u2019s latest demand is likely to stall a \u20ac3 billion aid package to the war-ravaged country as Russian forces continue their advance.\n\u201cThe objective exchange of arguments is becoming increasingly difficult\u201d on the platform formerly known as Twitter, says defense ministry.\nThe EU\u2019s strategy to deal with the far-right Freedom Party heading for power in Vienna is \u2026 hope for the best.\nConservative chancellor candidate Friedrich Merz railed against the climate policies of the left-leaning parties he\u2019ll likely have to govern with.",

Left Party officials said they would press charges for incitement to hatred.\nSahra Mirow, regional Left Party\u00a0chair for the state of Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg, where Karlsruhe is located, said the AfD was \"showing its true colors\" with the flyer campaign. \"They are dividing our society and spreading hate,\" she added.\nThe mayor of Karlsruhe, Frank Mentrup of the center-left\u00a0Social Democrats (SPD), also said the AfD had crossed a red line, telling local public broadcaster SWR that finding \"such notes in the mailbox reinforces a feeling of insecurity and fear.\"\nIn Berlin on Wednesday, a federal government spokesperson called the campaign \"tasteless\" but said any investigations were the responsibility of the relevant authorities.\nTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video\nThe \"tickets,\" which are also downloadable from the AfD Karlsruhe's official website, featured slogans such as \"It's nice at home, too\" and \"Only remigration can save Germany.\"\n\"Remigration\" is a far-right concept popular in European ethno-nationalist circles that refers to the forced or encouraged deportation of immigrants \u2014\u00a0and even the descendants of immigrants who may have been born in Europe but aren't deemed by far-right groups to be \"ethnically\" European \u2014\u00a0to the home countries of their ancestors.\nThe concept was a topic of discussion presented by Austrian identitarian Martin Sellner at a secret meeting of right-wing extremists in Potsdam, near Berlin, in November 2023, attended by members of the AfD. News of the meeting set off nationwide protests against the far right and saw some moderate losses in support for the AfD \u2014 losses which the party has already largely made up.\nTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video\n\"The fact that the AfD apparently wants to expel people en masse under the term 'remigration' shows not only its contempt for humanity, but also how much it would damage Germany as a business location and cost jobs,\" Federal Interior Minister Nancy Faeser told the Rheinische Post newspaper on Wednesday.\nShe noted that almost 25 million people in Germany \u2014\u00a0around 30% of the population \u2014\u00a0have a migration background.\n\"[Immigrants] have been an integral part of our society for a long time and keep our country running in many areas \u2014 in hospitals and care homes, in businesses and industry.

            "content": "Germany's top diplomat Annalena Baerbock and her French counterpart met members of Syria's rebel-formed transition government. The pair are the first EU diplomats to visit Syria since Bashar Assad's ouster.\nGermany's Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock\u00a0said Friday, Europe will support Syria's transitional government in Damascus if the political talks include all ethnic and religious groups in the country.\n\"A political new beginning between Europe and Syria, between Germany and Syria, is possible,\" Baerbock said.\nBaerbock and France's Jean-Noel Barrot met\u00a0Syria's de facto leader Ahmad al-Sharaa\u00a0in Damascus.\nThe two top diplomats are the first EU ministers to\u00a0visit Syria since the toppling of President Bashar Assad in December.\nTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video\nAfter talks with Al-Sharaa and other officials, Baerbock said lifting EU sanctions\u00a0will depend on the political process going forward.\nShe and Barrot traveled to Damascus \"to discuss whether such an inclusive political process is possible and whether human rights can truly be guaranteed. The entire question of lifting sanctions is tied to this,\"\u00a0Baerbock said.\n\"Europe will support\" Syria in its transition \"but Europe will not finance new Islamist structures,\" Baerbock told reporters at the end of her visit.\nAl-Sharaa greeted Baerbock and Barrot at the palace entrance, avoiding a handshake with Baerbock but briefly shaking hands with Barrot.\nBaerbock has said that the new Syrian government's relations with Germany and the EU are conditional on women and men of all ethnic and religious beliefs playing a role in Syria's new political system and that they are protected.\nTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video\nBarrot posted\u00a0on social media platform X: \"Together, France and Germany stand alongside the Syrian people, in all their diversity.\"\nAfter arriving in Damascus, Barrot expressed hope for a \"sovereign, stable and peaceful\" Syria.\nIt was also a \"hope that the aspirations of all Syrians can be realized,\"\u00a0he added, \"but it is a fragile hope.\"\nOne of the first stops on the trip was the notorious Saydnaya prison, dubbed \"the human slaughterhouse\" by Amnesty International.\nBarrot and Baerbock were accompanied by White Helmet rescuers as they toured the cells of the facility.\nVolunteers founded the\u00a0White Helmets in 2013 after the start of the civil war. They helped\u00a0rescue victims after airstrikes, but were also deployed after Syria and Turkey's devastating earthquakes\u00a0in 2023.\nHumanitarian groups say Syrian authorities under the Assad regime, systematically tortured and executed thousands of civilians.\n\"You simply can't imagine the horror of some places,\" Baerbock said. \"But people have gone through hell here near the Syrian capital Damascus. They were killed using methods that are unimaginable in a civilized world.\"\nBaerbock also met with representatives from Syria's civil society during her visit, according to Der Spiegel journalist Christoph Schult, who has been traveling with her.\nSpeaking to DW on Friday, Christoph Schult said that the representatives made it clear that while they \"welcome the new development,\" they \"also fear that the moderate approach that has been taken so far could probably change into a more extremist one, exclusive one targeting minorities, not including minorities.\"\nThe German top diplomat spoke to a Christian priest, Schult said, who told Baerbock that while he welcomes the developments, he acknowledged that under the Assad regime \"the Christians were more or less safe.\"\n\"They are not sure how that will develop under the new rulers,\" Schult said, citing the priest.\nFrench Foreign Minister Barrot also met with members of Syria's civil society, the French AFP news agency reported.\n\"A political solution must be reached with France's allies, the Kurds, so that they are fully integrated into this political process that is beginning today,\" Barrot was quoted as saying in the meeting.\nThe French top diplomat also called on Syria's new rulers to swiftly inspect and destroy chemical weapons stockpiles belonging to the former authorities.\nThe visit to Syria comes four weeks\u00a0after rebel groups in Syria, led by the Islamist Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS), swiftly gained control over the country, with former President Bashar Assad fleeing to Russia. HTS leader Ahmad al-Sharaa is now considered the head of Syria's transitional government.\nIn the days following Assad's ousting, Western governments had\u00a0been weighing up how best to engage with Syria's new leadership considering that HTS is under EU sanctions and also a designated terrorist group.\n\"We know where HTS comes from ideologically, what it has done in the past. But we also hear and see the desire for moderation and for understanding with other important actors,\" Baerbock said in a statement.\nAccording to the German Federal Statistical Office, around 973,000 Syrians were living in Germany at the end of 2023. Some 712,000 of them have\u00a0been granted refugee status.\nTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video\nMost came in 2015, when then-Chancellor Angela Merkel's government decided to allow refugees fleeing Syria's civil war into the country.\nOne day after the fall of the Assad regime in Syria, the Federal Office for Migration and Refugees (BAMF) issued an immediate freeze on asylum applications from Syrian citizens.\nkb/wd (AFP, dpa)",
